"rayyan-353830665","Behavioral response races, predator-prey shell games, ecology of fear, and patch use of pumas and their ungulate prey",2010,"ECOLOGY","Laundre, JW","English","The predator-prey shell game predicts random movement of prey across the landscape, whereas the behavioral response race and landscape of fear models predict that there should be a negative relationship between the spatial distribution of a predator and its behaviorally active prey. Additionally, prey have imperfect information on the whereabouts of their predator, which the predator should incorporate in its patch use strategy. I used a one-predator-one-prey system, puma (Puma concolor)-mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) to test the following predictions regarding predator-prey distribution and patch use by the predator. (1) Pumas will spend more time in high prey risk/low prey use habitat types, while deer will spend their time in low-risk habitats. Pumas should (2) select large forage patches more often, (3) remain in large patches longer, and (4) revisit individual large patches more often than individual smaller ones. I tested these predictions with an extensive telemetry data set collected over 16 years in a study area of patchy forested habitat. When active, pumas spent significantly less time in open areas of low intrinsic predation risk than did deer. Pumas used large patches more than expected, revisited individual large patches significantly more often than smaller ones, and stayed significantly longer in larger patches than in smaller ones. The results supported the prediction of a negative relationship in the spatial distribution of a predator and its prey and indicated that the predator is incorporating the prey's imperfect information about its presence. These results indicate a behavioral complexity on the landscape scale that can have far-reaching impacts on predator-prey interactions.","10.1890/08-2345.1     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","behavioral response race;follow-up visits;Idaho and Utah, USA;landscape of fear;mule deer;Odocoileus hemionus;patch use patterns;predator-prey interactions;Puma concolor;risk;HABITAT SELECTION;MULE DEER;ACTIVITY PATTERNS;FORAGING GAMES;RISK;CONCOLOR;GERBILS;LANDSCAPE;MOVEMENT;TIME;Continental Population Groups;Prednisolone","Shawn","Included"

But, traditional mass-action models of predator prey dynamics treat individuals as behaviorally unresponsive ""molecules"" in Brownian motion. Foraging theory should provide the conceptual framework to envision the interaction. But, current models of predator feeding behavior generally envision a clever predator consuming large numbers of sessile and behaviorally inert prey (e.g., kangaroo rats, Dipodomys, collecting seeds from food patches). Here, we extend foraging theory to consider a predator-prey game of stealth and fear and then embed this game into the modeling of predator-prey population dynamics. The melding of the prey and predator's optimal behaviors with their population and community-level consequences constitutes the ecology of fear. The ecology of fear identifies the endpoints of a continuum of N-driven (population size) versus mu-driven (fear) systems. In N-driven systems, the major direct dynamical feedback involves predators killing prey, whereas mu-driven systems involve the indirect effects from changes in fear levels and prey catchability. In mu-driven systems, prey respond to predators by becoming more vigilant or by moving away from suspected predators. In this way, a predator (e.g., mountain lion, Puma concolor) depletes a food patch (e.g., local herd of mule deer, Odocoileus hemionus) by frightening prey rather than by actually killing prey. Behavior buffers the system: a reduction in predator numbers should rapidly engender less vigilant and more catchable prey. The ecology of fear explains why big fierce carnivores should be and can be rare. In carnivore systems, ignore the behavioral game at one's peril.","10.2307/1383287     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Puma concolor;mountain lion;Odocoileus hemionus;mule deer;predator-prey dynamics;PREDATION RISK;PATCH USE;SPECIES INTERACTIONS;RESOURCE DEPRESSION;HABITAT SELECTION;PREY;BEHAVIOR;COMPETITION;CONSEQUENCES;GERBILS","Shawn","Included"

We model predator-prey interactions in which prey adjust vigilance behavior to mitigate risk of predation and predators their derring-do to manage risk of injury from capturing prey. High derring-do increases a predator's likelihood of capturing prey, but at higher risk of injury to itself. For fixed predator derring-do, prey increase vigilance in response to predator abundance, predator lethality, and predator encounter probability with prey and decrease vigilance with their own feeding rate; there is a humped-shaped relationship between prey vigilance and effectiveness of vigilance. For fixed prey vigilance, predators increase derring-do with the abundance of prey and predator lethality and decrease it with benefit of vigilance to prey and level of prey vigilance. When both prey and predator are behaviorally flexible, a predator-prey foraging game ensues whose solution represents an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS). At the ESS, prey provide themselves with a public good as their vigilance causes predators to decrease derring-do. Conversely, predators have negative indirect effects on themselves as their derring-do causes prey to be more vigilant. These behavioral feedbacks create negative intra-specific interaction coefficients. Increasing the population size of prey (or predators) now has a direct negative effect on the prey (or predators). Both effects help stabilize predator-prey dynamics. Besides highlighting a common way by which predators may experience a food-safety tradeoff via dangerous prey, the model suggests why natural selection favors even small defensive measures by prey and hulky predators.","10.1080/15659801.2016.1207298     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","derring-do or predator daring;ecology of fear and fear management;foraging games;predator-prey interactions;risk of injury and risk management;tradeoffs of food and safety;DANGEROUS PREY;HABITAT SELECTION;VIGILANCE;COEVOLUTION;DECISIONS;ECOLOGY;GERBILS;FEAR;Prednisolone","Shawn","Included"
"rayyan-353830670","Complex tactics in a dynamic large herbivore-carnivore spatiotemporal game",2019,"OIKOS","Simon, RN and Cherry, SG and Fortin, D","English","The spatiotemporal game between predators and prey is a fundamental process governing their distribution dynamics. Players may adopt different tactics as the associated costs and benefits change through time. Yet few studies have investigated the potentially simultaneous and dynamic nature of movement tactics used by both players. It is particularly unclear to what extent perceived predation risk mediates the fine-scale distribution of large and dangerous prey, which are mostly driven by bottom-up, resource-related processes. We built habitat use and movement models based on 10 years of monitoring GPS-collared grey wolves Canis lupus and plains bison Bison bison bison in Prince Albert National Park, Canada, to investigate the predator-large prey game in a multi-prey system. Bison did not underuse patches of high-quality vegetation at any time during the seasonal cycle even though wolves were selectively patrolling these areas. Rather, in at least one season, bison engaged in complex tactics comprised of proactive responses to the long-term distribution (risky places) and reactive responses to the immediate proximity (risky times) of their opponent. In summer-autumn, bison reduced the time spent in food-rich patches as both the long-term use and the immediate proximity of wolves increased. By demonstrating that wolf distribution triggers patch abandonment by bison, we provide a key element in support of the shell game hypothesis - where prey move constantly to avoid predators attempting to anticipate their location. In winter, a season of relatively high energetic stress, bison no longer abandoned food-rich patches as predation risk increased, while no bison responses to wolves were observed in spring-summer. Our work demonstrates the highly dynamic and complex nature of the predator-large prey spatiotemporal game, a key trait-mediated mechanism by which trophic interactions structure ecological communities.","10.1111/oik.06166     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","anti-predator behaviour;grey wolf;landscape of fear;large prey;plains bison;predation risk;predator-prey interaction;Prince Albert National Park;risky places;risky times;shell game;PREY SHELL GAMES;HABITAT SELECTION;ANTIPREDATOR RESPONSES;DECISION-MAKING;ANIMAL MOVEMENT;PREDATION RISK;PATCH USE;BISON;WOLVES;FEAR","Shawn","Included"

In this study, we propose a prey-predator model with fear in prey due to predator and anti-predator behavior by prey against the predator with fear response delay and gestation delay. It is assumed that the predator consumes prey via simplified Hotting Type-IV functional response. We evaluate the equilibrium points and study the local and global stability behavior of the system around them. It is observed that our system undergoes Hopf-bifurcation with respect to the fear parameter. Moreover, the system shows the attribute of bi-stability involving two stable equilibriums. Further, we study the dynamics of the delayed system by incorporating fear response delay and gestation delay. We observe that the delayed system suffers Hopf-bifurcation with respect to both delays. Using the normal form method and center manifold theory, the direction and stability of Hopf-bifurcation are studied. Chaotic behavior for delayed system is observed for large values of fear response delay. All these findings are supported by numerical simulation.

"rayyan-353830682","The ecology of fear and inverted biomass pyramids",2020,"OIKOS","Malone, MA and Halloway, AH and Brown, JS","English","In inverted biomass pyramids (IBPs) prey are outnumbered by their predators when measured by biomass. We investigate how prey should behave in the face of danger from higher predator biomass, and how anti-predator behavior (in the form of vigilance) can, in turn, affect the predator-prey system. In this study, we incorporate anti-predator behaviors into a Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model in the form of fixed and facultative vigilance. Facultative vigilance models behavior as a dynamic foraging game, allowing us to assess optimal behavioral responses in the context of IBPs using a dynamical fitness optimization approach. We model vigilance as a tradeoff between safety and either the prey's maximum growth rate or its carrying capacity. We assess the population dynamics of predators and prey with fear responses, and investigate the role fear plays on trophic structure. We found that the ecology of fear plays an important role in predator-prey systems, impacting trophic structure and the occurrence of IBPs. Fixed vigilance works against IBP structure by always reducing the predator-prey biomass ratio at equilibrium with increasing levels of vigilance. Facultative vigilance can actually promote IBPs, as prey can now adjust their vigilance levels to cope with increased predation and the costs associated with vigilance. This is especially true when the effectiveness of vigilance is low and predators are very lethal. In general, these trends are true whether the costs of vigilance are felt on the prey's maximum growth rate or its carrying capacity. Just as the ecology of fear, when first introduced, was used to explain why top carnivores are rare in terrestrial systems, it can also be used to understand how big fierce predators can be common in IBPs.","10.1111/oik.06948     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","anti-predator behavior;conservation;dynamics;ecology of fear;inverted biomass pyramid;predator-prey dynamics;trophic levels;vigilance;PREDATION RISK;ANTIPREDATOR BEHAVIOR;PHASE-SHIFTS;CORAL-REEFS;PATCH USE;FOOD;RESILIENCE;STABILITY;HERBIVORY;DYNAMICS","Shawn","Included"

Because an animal rarely encounters threatening stimuli in isolation, multiple disturbances can act in non-independent ways to shape an animal's landscape of fear, making it challenging to isolate their effects for effective and targeted management. We present extensions to an existing behavioral agent-based model (ABM) to use as an inverse modeling approach to test, in a scenario-sensitivity analysis, whether threatened Alberta boreal caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) differentially respond to industrial features (linear features, forest cutblocks, wellsites) and their attributes: presence, density, harvest age, and wellsite activity status. The spatially explicit ABM encapsulates predation risk, heterogeneous resource distribution, and species-specific energetic requirements, and successfully recreates the general behavioral mechanisms driving habitat selection. To create various industry-driven, predation-risk landscape scenarios for the sensitivity analysis, we allowed caribou agents to differentially perceive and respond to industrial features and their attributes. To identify which industry had the greatest relative influence on caribou habitat use and spatial distribution, simulated caribou movement patterns from each of the scenarios were compared with those of actual caribou from the study area, using a pattern-oriented, multi-response optimization approach. Results revealed caribou have incorporated forestry- and oil and gas features into their landscape of fear that distinctly affect their spatial and energetic responses. The presence of roads, pipelines and seismic lines, and, to a minor extent, high-density cutblocks and active wellsites, all contributed to explaining caribou behavioral responses. Our findings also indicated that both industries produced interaction effects, jointly impacting caribou spatial and energetic patterns, as no one feature could adequately explain anti-predator movement responses. We demonstrate that behavior-based ABMs can be applied to understanding, assessing, and isolating non-consumptive anthropogenic impacts, in support of wildlife management. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We consider that the growth rate of intraguild prey (IG prey) is reduced due to the cost of fear of intraguild predator (IG predator), and the growth rate of basal prey is suppressed due to the cost of fear of both the IG prey and the IG predator. The basic mathematical results such as positively invariant space, boundedness of the solutions, persistence of the system have been investigated. We further analyze the existence and local stability of the biologically feasible equilibrium points, and also study the Hopf-bifurcation analysis of the system with respect to the fear parameter. The direction of Hopf-bifurcation and the stability properties of the periodic solutions have also been investigated. We observe that in the absence of fear, omnivory produces chaos in a three-species food chain system. However, fear can stabilize the chaos thus obtained. We also observe that the system shows bistability behavior between IG prey free equilibrium and IG predator free equilibrium, and bistability between IG prey free equilibrium and interior equilibrium. Furthermore, we observe that for a suitable set of parameter values, the system may exhibit multiple stable limit cycles.

Animals have the options of foraging or remaining inactive. Prey harvest resources and incur a mortality risk only while foraging. ESS levels of prey and predator activity have three distinct phases over the time course of a resource pulse. During the first phase, resources are sufficiently abundant to permit profitable foraging by all prey and predators. During the second phase, only a fraction of prey and predator are active. The fraction of active prey is sufficient to allow profitable foraging by the predators. Resource abundances and activity level of predators decline synchronously, balancing the prey's needs for food and safety. During the third phase, resources decline to where both prey and predator cease activity. These adaptive behaviors of prey and predator to resources and to each other promote the stability of the predator-prey dynamics.","","EXPLOITATION ECOSYSTEMS;ANTIPREDATOR BEHAVIOR;HABITAT SELECTION;PATCH USE;RISK;COMPETITION;IDEAL;FOOD;COEXISTENCE;DYNAMICS;Prednisolone;Health Resources","Shawn","Included"

Following recent models of search and pursuit, we assume the prey has a fixed number of heterogeneous 'hiding' places (for example, ice holes for a seal to breathe) and that the predator (maybe polar bear) has the time or energy to search a fixed number of these. If he searches the actual hiding location and also successfully pursues the prey there, he wins the game. If he fails to find the prey, he loses. In this paper, we modify the outcome in the case that he finds but does not catch the prey. The prey is now vulnerable to capture while relocating with risk depending on the intervening terrain. This generalizes the original games to a stochastic game framework, a first for search and pursuit games. We outline a general solution and also compute particular solutions. This modified model now has implications for the question of when to stay or leave the lair and by what routes. In particular, we find the counterintuitive result that in some cases adding risk of predation during prey relocation may result in more relocation. We also model the process by which the players can learn about the properties of the different hiding locations and find that having to learn the capture probabilities is favourable to the prey.","10.1098/rsif.2019.0087     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","game theory;search games;predator-prey theory;pursuit escape;behavioural ecology;Prednisolone","Shawn","Maybe"
"rayyan-353830691","Impact of fear effect on the growth of prey in a predator-prey interaction model",2020,"ECOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY","Sarkar, K and Khajanchi, S","English","Several field data and experiments on a terrestrial vertebrates exhibited that the fear of predators would cause a substantial variability of prey demography. Fear for predator population enhances the survival probability of prey population, and it can greatly reduce the reproduction of prey population. Based on the experimental evidence, we proposed and analyzed a prey-predator system introducing the cost of fear into prey reproduction with Holling type-II functional response. We investigate all the biologically feasible equilibrium points, and their stability is analyzed in terms of the model parameters. Our mathematical analysis exhibits that for strong antipredator responses can stabilize the prey-predator interactions by ignoring the existence of periodic behaviors. Our model system undergoes Hopf bifurcation by considering the birth rate r(0) as a bifurcation parameter. For larger prey birth rate, we investigate the transition to a stable coexisting equilibrium state, with oscillatory approach to this equilibrium state, indicating that the greatest characteristic eigenvalues are actually a pair of imaginary eigenvalues with real part negative, which is increasing for r(0). We obtained the conditions for the occurrence of Hopf bifurcation and conditions governing the direction of Hopf bifurcation, which imply that the prey birth rate will not only influence the occurrence of Hopf bifurcation but also alter the direction of Hopf bifurcation. We identify the parameter regions associated with the extinct equilibria, predator-free equilibria and coexisting equilibria with respect to prey birth rate, predator mortality rates. Fear can stabilize the predator-prey system at an interior steady state, where all the species can exists together, or it can create the oscillatory coexistence of all the populations. We performed some numerical simulations to investigate the relationship between the effects of fear and other biologically related parameters (including growth/decay rate of prey/ predator), which exhibit the impact that fear can have in prey-predator system. Our numerical illustrations also demonstrate that the prey become less sensitive to perceive the risk of predation with increasing prey growth rate or increasing predators decay rate.","10.1016/j.ecocom.2020.100826     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Fear effect;Hopf bifurcation;Anti-predator defence;Stability analysis;Average Lyapunov functional;RISK;SYSTEM;PERSISTENCE;STABILITY;DEFENSE;FOOD;Prednisolone","Shawn","Included"

Even if the fear is sufficiently large, the prey can survive under the saturated fear cost. Moreover, the sensitivity of prey to predator will affect the population density of prey and predator. It is feasible to introduce the saturated fear cost and predator-taxis sensitivity into the predator-prey interactions model. In this paper, we obtain the threshold condition of the persistence for the proposed model and discuss all ecologically feasible equilibrium points and their stability in terms of the model parameters. Furthermore, when choose the fear level as bifurcation parameter, the model will arise single Hopf bifurcation point. However, when choose the predator-taxis sensitivity as bifurcation parameter, the model will arise two Hopf bifurcation points. In order to determine the stability of the limit cycle caused by Hopf bifurcation, the first Lyapunov number is calculated in detail. In addition, by the sensitivity analysis and the elasticity analysis, the saturated fear cost takes on the strong impact on the sensitivity for the model, and the predator death rate has a greater impact on the persistence of the model than the prey death rate.

Fear of predators increases the survival probability of prey, but leads to a cost of prey reproduction.

Mathematical analyses show that the fear effect can interplay with maturation delay between juvenile prey and adult prey in determining the long-term population dynamics. A positive equilibrium may lose stability with an intermediate value of delay and regain stability if the delay is large. Numerical simulations show that both strong adaptation of adult prey and the large cost of fear have destabilizing effect while large population of predators has a stabilizing effect on the predator-prey interactions.

A predator-prey model with the effect of fear, refuge, and hunting cooperation has been investigated in this paper. The system's equilibria are obtained and their local stability behavior is discussed. The existence of Hopf-bifurcation is analytically shown by taking refuge as a bifurcation parameter. There are many ecological factors which are not instantaneous processes, and so, to make the system more realistic, we incorporate three discrete time delays: in the effect of fear, refuge and hunting cooperation, and analyze the delayed system for stability and bifurcation. Moreover, for environmental fluctuations, we further modify the delayed system by incorporating seasonality in the fear, refuge and cooperation. We have analyzed the seasonally forced delayed system for the existence of a positive periodic solution. In the support of analytical results, some numerical simulations are carried out. Sensitivity analysis is used to identify parameters having crucial impacts on the ecological balance of predator-prey interactions. We find that the rate of predation, fear, and hunting cooperation destabilizes the system, whereas prey refuge stabilizes the system. Time delay in the cooperation behavior generates irregular oscillations whereas delay in refuge stabilizes an otherwise unstable system. Seasonal variations in the level of fear and refuge generate higher periodic solutions and bursting patterns, respectively, which can be replaced by simple 1-periodic solution if the cooperation and fear are also allowed to vary with time in the former and latter situations. Higher periodicity and bursting patterns are also observed due to synergistic effects of delay and seasonality. Our results indicate that the combined effects of fear, refuge and hunting cooperation play a major role in maintaining a healthy ecological environment.","10.1142/S0218339021500236     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Predator-Prey Model;Fear;Refuge;Hunting Cooperation;Time Delay;Seasonality;INDUCED STRESS;SYSTEM;DYNAMICS;RISK;STABILITY;FOOD;BIFURCATIONS;UNCERTAINTY;SENSITIVITY;VIGILANCE;Prednisolone","Shawn","Included"

"rayyan-353830713","Strategy, compromise, and cheating in predator-prey games",2007,"EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY RESEARCH","Wolf, N and Mangel, M","English","Background: A prey's optimal level of anti-predator behaviour depends on its hunger state and its assessment of danger in the environment. Similarly, a predator's optimal attack behaviour depends on its own satiation level and its assessment of the risks and costs associated with hunting. The optimal behaviour of each depends on what the other is doing, resulting in a dynamic game.        Assumptions: We assume that predators are more successful at hunting their prey when prey are further from safety, and that prey are more successful in finding their food items in more risky environments.        Question: Under these assumptions, what is the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) and how does it respond to false attacks by the predators?        Mathematical methods: We use stochastic dynamic programming to compute the probabilities of prey and predators surviving a foraging season (e.g. the winter) and game theoretical methods to compute the evolutionarily stable strategies.        Results: We find the ESS, and we demonstrate that when foraging time is limited, a predator benefits from making extra 'false' attacks on the prey, assuming it can do so safely and efficiently. The extra attacks disturb the prey until they can no longer afford the time for anti-predator behaviour and become easier targets during the next 'real' attack.","","evolutionarily stable strategies;game theory;killer whale;krill;Steller sea lions;stochastic dynamic programming;STELLER SEA LIONS;RISK;STARVATION;DECISIONS;ABUNDANCE;BEHAVIOR;ECOLOGY;DECLINE;SPACE;DEATH;Prednisolone","Shawn","Included"

The role of hunting cooperation and the fear effect in the predator-prey system is gaining considerable attention by the researchers recently. But the study on combined effect of hunting cooperation and fear in the predator-prey system is not yet studied. In the present paper, we investigate the impact of hunting cooperation among predators and predator induced fear in prey population by using the classical predator-prey model. We consider that predator populations cooperate during hunting. We also consider that hunting cooperation induces fear among prey, which has far richer and complex dynamics. We observe that without hunting cooperation, the unique coexistence equilibrium point is globally asymptotically stable. However, an increase in the hunting cooperation induced fear may destabilize the system and produce periodic solution via Hopf-bifurcation. The stability of the Hopf-bifurcating periodic solution is obtained by computing the Lyapunov coefficient. The limit cycles thus obtained may be supercritical or subcritical. We also observe that the system undergoes the Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation in two-parameter space. Further, we observe that the system exhibits backward bifurcation between predator-free equilibrium and coexisting equilibrium. The system also exhibits two different types of bi-stabilities due to subcritical Hopf-bifurcation (between interior equilibrium and stable limit cycle) and backward bifurcation (between predator-free and interior equilibrium points). Further, we observe strong demographic Allee phenomenon in the system. To visualize the dynamical behavior of the system, extensive numerical experiments are performed by using MATLAB and MATCONT softwares.","10.1016/j.ecocom.2019.100770     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Hunting cooperation;Fear effect;Multiple limit cycles;Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation;Bi-stability;Allee effect;TEMPORAL VARIATION;HABITAT SELECTION;PACK SIZE;RISK;ELK;STRATEGIES;STABILITY;RESPONSES;LIONS;Prednisolone","Shawn","Included"

Mathematical properties such as equilibrium analysis, stability analysis, bifurcation analysis and persistence have been investigated. We also describe the global stability analysis of the equilibrium points. Our numerical simulations reveal that cost of fear in basal prey may exhibit bistability by producing unstable limit cycles, however, fear in middle predator can replace unstable limit cycles by a stable limit cycle or a stable interior equilibrium. We observe that fear can stabilize the system from chaos to stable focus through the period-halving phenomenon. We conclude that chaotic dynamics can be controlled by the fear factors.

Moreover, we interrelate these two factors, through the predator-taxis sensitivity, as the total time or energy for foraging and defense is constant for prey. If the prey invests more time or energy for group defense, then reproduction may decrease due to that investment. We provide detailed mathematical results, including, basic dynamical properties, existence of positive equilibria, asymptotic stability of all equilibria, Hopf-bifurcation, direction and stability of bifurcated periodic solutions. We also provide some global features and possible occurrence of multi-stability in our model. Furthermore, we perform detailed numerical simulations to validate our mathematical results numerically. Our mathematical and numerical results suggest that the predator-taxis sensitivity should be less than some threshold density, for possible survivability of predator. We provide some sensitivity analysis of our model solutions with respect to the three important model parameters, namely, the predator-taxis sensitivity, level of fear, and the tolerance limit of predator. We can observe that the perturbation of the tolerance limit of predator has the greatest influence over model dynamics. Initially, the predator-taxis sensitivity has a positive effect on prey as its decreases the killing rate, however, for long run, its effect is negative on both the solutions, as it decreases the growth rate of prey, which affects overall fitness of both the populations.

Fear of middle-predator affects the growth rate of prey and the fear of top-predator reduces the predation of middle-predator on prey species. The prey and middle-predator are assumed to take refuge against predation. Numerical results confirm the stabilizing role of refuge whereas hunting cooperation destroys stability and induces limit cycle oscillations. We find that the fear of middle-predator on prey has tendency to stabilize the system while the fear of top-predator on middle-predator creates instability in the system. Further, time delays are considered in the processes of taking refuges and hunting cooperations. Delay in hunting cooperations creates multiple stability switches in the system. Furthermore, seasonal forcing of parameters related to refuges and hunting cooperations depicts a more realistic scenario. We investigate the behaviors of seasonally forced system in the absence as well as presence of time delays. The seasonally forced system exhibits different types of periodic solutions. Complex bursting patterns are observed due to periodicity in refuge of middle-predator (cooperation of top-predator).

However, aside from direct consumption, fear of predators could also increase vigilance and reduce time spent foraging as population size decreases, as has been observed in wild mammals living in social groups. To investigate the role of fear on fitness in relation to population density in a species with limited sociality, we exposed varying densities of Drosophila melanogaster to mantid predators either during an experimental breeding season or non-breeding season. The presence of mantids in either season decreased the reproductive performance of individuals but only at low breeding densities, providing evidence for an Allee effect. We then used our experimental results to parametrize a mathematical model to examine the population consequences of fear at low densities. Fear tended to destabilize population dynamics and increase the risk of extinction up to sevenfold. Our study provides unique experimental evidence that the indirect effects of the presence of predators can cause an Allee effect and has important consequences for our understanding of the dynamics of small populations.","10.1098/rspb.2017.0878     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","carry-over effects;Drosophila melanogaster;extinction risk;non-consumptive effects of predators;small populations;Tenodera sinensis;TROPHIC CASCADES;PREDATION RISK;DENSITY-DEPENDENCE;PACIFIC SALMON;REPRODUCTION;BEHAVIOR;CONSERVATION;MORTALITY;DRIVEN;PREY","Shawn","Included"

Behavioural tactics used by adult seals appear to account for the variance in risk from sharks, while shark tactics seem more influenced by the behaviour of pup seals, probably because pup seals engage in riskier behaviours. A dynamic game model of the interaction predicts that, if pups and adult seals account for risk in a similar manner, then tactic selection used by sharks and seals should be more evenly distributed across all possible options. Instead, a second model in which pups were constrained to choose the riskiest option produced evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) solutions for both species that more closely approximated the tactics recorded, suggesting that behavioural variation within subgroups of a population should be accounted for when modelling predator-prey interactions.

In almost every ecological model, the prey species is curtailed by the direct attacking of predator species. However, from different experimental shreds of evidence, it has been observed that fear (felt by prey) for predators can change the physiological behaviour of prey individuals and greatly reduces their reproduction rate as well as enhances their mortality rate. In this current work, we develop and explore a predator-prey model incorporating the cost of perceived fear into the birth and death rates of prey species with Holling type-II functional response. In addition, the intraspecific competition within predator species and a gestation delay are introduced in the model to obtain more realistic and natural dynamics. Feasibility of all the steady states and their stability conditions are analysed in terms of the model parameters. We show that only existence of an interior equilibrium point is sufficient to prevent the extinction of predator species. In this case, either both species can exist together or oscillate around that interior equilibrium point. We can also recognize the parametric region where the system produces multiple coexistence equilibria in which different initial biomass of populations may produce different long-term outcomes. The basic bifurcation analyses of the system exhibit that a higher level of fear or higher intraspecific competition rate helps the population to survive in a coexistence state. For a suitable choice of parametric values, the proposed model may produce the bi-stable phenomenon between two coexistence steady states. We obtain a parametric condition for which the model system experiences a Hopf bifurcation if the delay parameter exceeds some threshold value. All of these theoretical findings are verified by various numerical examples. (C) 2021 International Association for Mathematics and Computers in Simulation (IMACS). Published by Elsevier B.V.

Here, the fractional calculus has been taken into consideration to investigate the dynamical behaviour of the solutions of the proposed model system as the changes in life cycle of prey species are of memory bound. Biological validation and well-posedness such as positivity and boundedness of solutions of the model system have been proved analytically. Stability analysis of all the feasible equilibrium points of the model system has been performed in a systematic way. Some important dynamical features of the model system (such as transition of stability of the system) have been demonstrated through rigorous numerical simulation. It is observed that our proposed model system experiences Hopf-bifurcation around the interior equilibrium point with respect to both the parameters f and m(1), which are linked with amount of predator induced fear and rate of prey refuge, respectively. The system dynamics is more likely to be stable in the framework of fractional order derivative in comparison to integer-order derivative. The high amount of predator induced fear f and prey refuge rate m(1) are independently capable to make the system dynamics to be stable in integer order model system. On the other hand, the dynamics of the model system shifts towards the stability from its unstable behaviour when we continuously reduce the order of the model system; especially under the scenario of low level of predator induced fear and prey refuge rate. Thus, our comprehensive mathematical findings reveal the fact that fading memory can play a contributory role towards stable coexistence of the predator-prey system whereas strong memory of the species deteriorates the stable coexistence of the model system.

The cost of these defensive strategies can include energetic investment in defensive structures, reduced energy income, lower mating success, and emigration which ultimately reduces the reproduction of prey. To explore the effect of these defensive strategies (anti-predator behaviors), a modified Leslie-Gower predator-prey model with the cost of fear has been considered. Gestation delay is also incorporated in the system for a more realistic formulation. Boundedness, equilibria and stability analysis are performed for the temporal system. By considering gestation delay as a bifurcation parameter, the existence of Hopf-bifurcation around the interior equilibrium point is discussed together with the direction, stability, and period of bifurcating solutions arising through Hopf-bifurcation. The spatial extension of the proposed model incorporating density-dependent cross-diffusion is also investigated and the conditions for diffusion-driven instability are obtained. To illustrate the analytical findings, detailed numerical simulations are performed. Biologically realistic Turing patterns such as spots, spots and stripes mixture, and labyrinthine type patterns are identified. It is found that the fear level has a stabilizing impact on delay induced destabilization and both stabilizing and destabilizing effects on Turing instability.","10.1002/mma.8207     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","cross-diffusion;fear effect;gestation delay;Hopf-bifurcation;Turing instability;TEMPORAL VARIATION;RISK;ELK;DYNAMICS;BEHAVIOR;INTERFERENCE;RESPONSES;SELECTION;ECOLOGY;GROWTH;Prednisolone","Shawn","Included"

We assume that zooplankton species have developed defense mechanisms against fish predation. The fear of fish predation altered anti-predator defenses, which affects the growth of the fish population. On the other hand, zooplankton refuge reduces fish induced mortality of zooplankton and plays a significant role in controlling phytoplankton growth. The density of fish species is suppressed in the presence of high refuge and the anti-predator response of zooplankton. It is determined that K and r(1) can influence not only plankton-fish demography but also induce some mechanism to terminate planktonic blooms. Our mathematical study reveals that the low level of fear can stabilize the system dynamics in the presence of high rate of zooplankton refuge. Moreover, the low rate of zooplankton refuge can exclude complexity from the plankton-fish ecosystem in the presence of strong anti-predator responses of zooplankton. We have established the existence of all feasible biological equilibria and derived the conditional local and global stability of the given system around it. The Hopf-bifurcation analysis is carried out by considering K and r(1) as bifurcation parameters. The direction of bifurcating solutions is also determined using the centre manifold arguments.

We indicate that the dynamical behavior of the model is closely related to the fear effect on predator. In detail, when the fear effect parameter p = p*, the system will undergo degenerate Hopf bifurcation. There exist two limit cycles (the inner is stable and the outer is unstable). However, when p = p(*), the system will undergo degenerate Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation. Also, by numerical simulation, we conclude that the stronger the fear effect, the bigger the density of prey species. The above shows that fear effect on predator is beneficial to the persistence of the prey species.

This study is new in the sense that the dynamics of such system was studied either through fear or migration, or switching, but the combined effects of such three factors are yet to be explored. We observe oscillatory behavior of the system in the absence of fear, migration and switching, whereas the system shows stable dynamics if anyone of these three factors is introduced. After analyzing the behavior of system with fear, migration and switching, we find that the system does not possess periodic solution whenever the predator population experiences intraspecies competition, but in the absence of intraspecies competition among predator population, fear of predators destabilizes the system, whereas on increasing the migration rates, the system first undergoes subcritical Hopf-bifurcation and then supercritical Hopf-bifurcation settling the system to stable coexistence. Existence of multiple limit cycles is also observed. Our results show that switching behavior of predator population supports the survival of prey and predator populations. We extend our model by assuming the fear parameters as time dependent. We find that the nonautonomous system exhibits periodic solutions, whereas the corresponding autonomous system shows stable focus. Moreover, we observe that if the autonomous system undergoes a Hopf-bifurcation through limit cycle oscillations, the corresponding nonautonomous system shows higher periodic solutions. Almost periodic behavior of the system is also observed by setting the fear parameters as almost periodic functions of time.","10.1007/s11071-021-06210-y     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Predator-prey model;Fear effect;Switching;Periodic solution;Global attractivity;Almost periodic solution;Prednisolone","Shawn","Included"

Through model analysis, it has been observed that fear factor regulates the dynamics of the system in a completely different way than in the case where functional response is only prey dependent. Also, intra-specific competition among predators reduces the effect of fear and it forms a different pattern in the system dynamics than that of the effect of fear.

However, little theory has considered the case where predators and prey respond to one another simultaneously. I present a framework that examines the impact of the predator-prey behavioural interactions (within and between species) in a state-dependent life-history context. I use multiple linked dynamic state variable game equations to predict the patch selection of prey and predators as a function of their energy reserves. When prey are expected to maximize their probability of survival, the individual predators and prey that are not at risk of starvation are predicted to be uniformly distributed among patches independent of the difference in resource input rates among sites. However, individuals near starvation cause more prey and predators to be found in high resource sites. In contrast, when predators and prey both maximize reproduction, predators and prey are predicted to show imperfect resource matching. The proportion of individuals at risk of starvation causes deviations from the perfect resource matching predicted by previous predator-prey games. The predicted patterns clearly illustrate the importance of recognizing that predators and prey will both respond concurrently to one another's distributions. However, the models also illustrate that an organism's state, competition among conspecifics and the life-history pattern of both predators and prey are key to understanding their distribution and behaviour. We can increase our understanding of these interactions and the distribution of predators and prey in space and time by combining the consideration of interactions within and between the species with knowledge of how foraging relates to lifetime expected reproductive success of both predators and prey.","","dynamic state variable model;game theory;habitat selection;life history;predator-prey interactions;IDEAL FREE DISTRIBUTION;EVOLUTIONARILY STABLE STRATEGIES;DIEL VERTICAL MIGRATION;INDIVIDUAL-BASED MODELS;POPULATION-DYNAMICS;ENGRAULIS-MORDAX;NORTHERN ANCHOVY;MATING-BEHAVIOR;RISK;HISTORY;Prednisolone","Shawn","Included"

However, little is known either theoretically or empirically about behavioral mechanisms that underlie the spatial patterns that emerge when predators and prey freely interact. We examined the joint space use and behavioral rules governing movement of freely interacting groups of odonate (dragonfly) predators and two size classes of anuran (tadpole) prey in arenas containing two patches with different levels of the prey's resource. Predator and prey movement and space use was quantified both when they were apart and together. When apart from predators, large tadpoles strongly preferred the high resource patch. When apart from prey, dragonflies weakly preferred the high resource patch. When together, large prey shifted to a uniform distribution, while predators strongly preferred the high resource patch. These patterns qualitatively fit the predictions of several three trophic level, ideal free distribution models. In contrast, the space use of small prey and predators did not deviate from uniform. Three measures of joint space use ( spatial correlations, overlap, and co-occurrence) concurred in suggesting that prey avoidance of predators was more important than predator attraction to prey in determining overall spatial patterns. To gain additional insight into behavioral mechanisms, we used a model selection approach to identify behavioral movement rules that can potentially explain the observed, emergent patterns of space use. Prey were more likely to leave patches with more predators and more conspecific competitors; resources had relatively weak effects on prey movements. In contrast, predators were more likely to leave patches with low resources (that they do not consume) and more competing predators; prey had relatively little effect on predator movements. These results highlight the importance of investigating freely interacting predators and prey, the potential for simple game theory models to predict joint spatial distributions, and the utility of using model choice methods to identify potential key factors that govern movement.","10.1890/06-1236     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","amphibian larvae;antipredator behavior;behavioral response race;game theory;ideal free distributions;invertebrate predators;model selection;patch use;predator;predator-prey foraging games;prey;HABITAT SELECTION GAMES;IDEAL FREE DISTRIBUTION;FORAGING GAMES;DENSITY-DEPENDENCE;PATCH CHOICE;DYNAMICS;RISK;CONSEQUENCES;AGGREGATION;GERBILS;Prednisolone","Shawn","Maybe"

In the model, both prey and predator may choose between either a simple or a complex habitat. A second predator is restricted to hunting only in the simple habitat. The model is applied to a system of rodents and their predators: snakes (the generalist predator) and owls. The simplest version of the model predicts that snakes and rodents distribute themselves among the two microhabitats according to the relative magnitude of risk for rodents. Under various conditions (moonlight, competition among rodents and dilution of the risk) the model predicts that snakes distribute themselves among habitats in a way that dampens rodent reactions to variation in owl predation risk and to effects of competition. When rodents are abundant the model predicts that snakes will show a weaker reaction to moonlight. The predictions of the model are qualitatively comparable to field data of microhabitat use of kangaroo rats and sidewinders from the Mojave Desert. The model can also describe a habitat selection game at a larger scale (e.g., movements of snakes into a rich desert oasis). Although a game between predators and prey may not be the cause for all their movements among habitats in the field, a game perspective may contribute explanations for what would otherwise be unintuitive habitat shifts.","","PREDATION RISK;FORAGING BEHAVIOR;PREY INTERACTIONS;KANGAROO RATS;DESERT RODENT;FISH;OWLS;MICROHABITAT;MOONLIGHT;EVOLUTION;Prednisolone;Rodentia","Shawn","Included"

I analyzed the game using a computer-based evolutionary algorithm. This algorithm embedded an individual-based model of ecological interactions within a dynamic adaptive process of mutation and selection. I investigated how evolutionarily stable strategies (ESS) varied with the predators' learning ability, killing efficiency, density and rate of movement. I found that when predators learn prey location, random prey movement can be an ESS. Increased predator killing efficiency reduced prey movement, but only if the rate of predator movement was low. Predators countered ratcheting vigilance by delaying their follow-up attacks; however, this delay was reduced in the presence of additional predators. The interdependence of pre-and post-encounter behaviors revealed by the evolutionary algorithm suggests an intricate co-evolution of multi-behavioral predator-prey behavioral strategies.","10.1111/j.1600-0706.2009.17204.x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","HABITAT SELECTION GAMES;WAITING GAME;RISK;VIGILANCE;DYNAMICS;ECOLOGY;Algorithms;Prednisolone","Shawn","Included"

The impact of fear effect in a three-species food chain model, where the top predator is a generalist predator, is not yet investigated. In the present work, a three-species food chain model incorporating the fear of predators is investigated, where the fear of generalist predator impedes the growth rate of the specialist predator, and the fear of specialist predator reduces the birth rate of the prey. We derive criteria for the existence of all possible non-negative equilibrium points and provide some remarks on their local stability. Additionally, the conditions for the occurrence of various local bifurcations have been established. In the absence of fear, we show that the model exhibits chaotic dynamics via periodic-doubling route when the birth rate of the prey is varied. Furthermore, we observe that fear can alter the stability of the model from a chaotic zone to a stable zone via period-halving route. It is also observed that with an appropriate choice of parameter values, fear can act as a damping mechanism, preventing the unwanted blow-up of the generalist predator in finite time.

These models predict that prey should leave a chosen patch only if and when the food depletes below some critical level. In nature, however, prey individuals may regularly move among food patches, even in the apparent absence of food depletion. We suggest that such prey movement is part of a predator-prey ""shell game"", in which predators attempt to learn prey location, and the prey attempt to be unpredictable in space. We investigate this shell game using an individual-based model that allows predators to update information about prey location, and permits prey to move with some random component among patches, but with reduced energy intake. Our results show the best prey strategy depends on what the predator does. A non-learning (randomly moving) predator favors non-moving prey - moving prey suffer higher starvation and predation. However, a learning predator favors prey movement. In general, the best prey strategy involves movement biased toward, but not completely committed to, the richer food patch. The strategy of prey movement remains beneficial even in combination with other anti-predator defenses, such as prey vigilance.","10.1034/j.1600-0706.2002.990205.x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","HABITAT SELECTION;GROUP-SIZE;TRADE-OFF;RISK;VIGILANCE;ECOLOGY;DEFENSE;SEARCH;MEMORY;LEVEL;Decision Making;Prednisolone","Shawn","Included"

In the absence of predators, models predict that prey (e.g., herbivores) will aggregate strongly in habitats where their resources (e.g., plants) are abundant. However, game theoretic models predict that in the presence of predators, prey use of resource-rich habitats declines. Paradoxically, it is instead predators that are predicted to be mostly strongly aggregated in areas where the prey's resources (plants) are abundant, even though the predators themselves do not utilize these resources. This striking result has been dubbed the ""leapfrog effect"" by Sih (1998, 2004). Here I explore the possibility that predictions for predator and prey habitat selection are sensitive to the assumption that predators forage free from any predation risk of their own. I contrast the predictions of a 3-trophic level model with those of a 4-trophic level model, and show that incorporating the constraint imposed on ""intermediate predator"" foraging behavior by the risk of attack from ""top predators"" can produce substantial changes in model predictions. Most importantly, the leapfrog effect is largely eliminated.

In the present investigation, we modify the Hastings-Powell (HP) [1991] model by considering the cost of fear in middle predator and the Allee effect in top predator. The stability conditions for the biologically feasible equilibria are derived using linear stability analysis. Considering the cost of fear and the Allee effect as key parameters, the Hopf bifurcation analysis is carried out around the interior equilibrium. The direction of Hopf bifurcation and the stability of the bifurcating periodic solution are determined by applying the normal form theory and center manifold theorem. Our numerical results suggest that the fear effect can stabilize the system. It is observed that high levels of fear among middle predator decrease the population density of top predator. We also observe that if the Allee parameter is increased, then the system becomes stable from chaotic oscillations. However, further increase in the Allee parameter leads to population extinction.

In systems where both predator and prey share similar sensory modalities and cognitive abilities, such as with marine mammals, the dynamic nature of predator-prey interactions is poorly understood. The costs and benefits of these anti-predator adaptations need to be evaluated and quantified based on the dynamic engagement of predator and prey. Many theoretic models have addressed the complexity of predator-prey relationships, but few have translated into testable mechanistic models. In this study, we developed a spatially-explicit, geo-referenced, individual-based model of a prototypical adult dusky dolphin off Kaikoura, New Zealand facing a more powerful, yet infrequent predator, the killer whale. We were interested in two primary objectives, (1) to capture the varying behavioral game between a clever prey and clever predator based on our current understanding of the Kaikoura system, (2) to compare evolutionary costs vs. benefits (foraging time and number of predator encounters) for an adult non-maternal dusky dolphin at various levels of killer whale-avoidance behaviors and no avoidance rules. We conducted Monte Carlo simulations to address model performance and parametric uncertainty. Mantel tests revealed an 88% correlation (426 x 426 distance matrix, km(2)) between observed field sightings of dusky dolphins with model generated sightings for non-maternal adult dusky dolphin groups. Simulation results indicated that dusky dolphins incur a 2.7% loss in feeding time by evolving the anti-predator behavior of moving to and from the feeding grounds. Further, each evolutionary strategy we explored resulted in dolphins incurring an additional loss of foraging time. At low killer whale densities (appearing less than once every 3 days), each evolutionary strategy simulated converged towards the evolutionary cost of foraging, that is, the loss in foraging time approached the 2.7% loss experienced by evolving near shore-offshore movement behavior. However, the highest level of killer whale presence resulted in 38% decreases in foraging time. The biological significance of these losses potentially incurred by a dusky dolphin is dependent on various factors from dolphin group foraging behavior and individual energy needs to dolphin prey availability and behavior.

Here, we use adaptive dynamics to model changes in behavioural rates of a predator and prey, while explicitly allowing both to make decisions simultaneously. Our model focuses on a two-patch situation. The prey can move between an open patch, allowing for energy intake but also predation risk, and a refuge with no possibility of energy intake or predation risk. The predator can move between that patch, where it can attack prey, and an alternative patch that provides a fixed rate of energy intake, and consequently imposes a missed opportunity cost (MOC) of using the focal patch. The model predicts how the rates of movement by the players are influenced by specific parameters, including the predator's lethality and MOC, as well as the information available to the players. For example, our model predicts that the time a prey takes to emerge from its refuge and the time a predator waits for the prey to emerge depend on the sequence of events leading to the prey entering the refuge. For instance, the predator would leave the patch more quickly and the prey would emerge from the refuge more quickly if the prey entered the refuge after a failed attack rather than as part of its time allocation.

In the model there is a trade-off between gaining information about predation risk and anti-predator behaviour. All predator attacks lead to death for the prey, so that the prey learns about predation risk by virtue of the fact that it is still alive. We show that it is not usually optimal to behave as if the current unbiased estimate of the predation risk is its true value. We consider two different ways to model reproduction; in the first scenario the animal reproduces throughout its life until it dies, and in the second scenario expected reproductive success depends on the level of energy reserves the animal has gained by some point in time. For both of these scenarios we find results on the form of the optimal strategy and give numerical examples which compare optimal behaviour with behaviour under simple rules of thumb. The numerical examples suggest that the value of the optimal strategy over the rules of thumb is greatest when there is little current information about predation risk, learning is not too costly in terms of predation, and it is energetically advantageous to learn about predation. We find that for the model and parameters investigated, a very simple rule of thumb such as 'use the best constant control' performs well. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

In this paper, we propose to explore the dynamics of a phytoplankton-zooplankton-fish system, with fear-induced birth rate reduction in the middle predator by the top predator and an additional food source for the top predator fish. Phytoplankton-zooplankton and zooplankton-fish interactions are handled using Holling type IV and II responses, respectively. First, we prove the well-posedness of the system, followed by results related to the existence of possible equilibrium points. Conditions under which a different number of interior equilibria exist are also derived here. We also show this existence numerically by varying the intrinsic growth rate of phytoplankton species, which demonstrates the model's vibrant nature from a mathematical point of view. Furthermore, we performed the local and global stability analysis around the above equilibrium points, and the transversality conditions for the occurrence of Hopf bifurcations and transcritical bifurcations are established. We observe numerically that for low levels of fear, the system behaves chaotically, and as we increase the fear parameter, the solution approaches a stable equilibrium by the route of period-halving. The chaotic behavior of the system at low levels of fear can also be controlled by increasing the quality of additional food. To corroborate our findings, we constructed several phase portraits, time-series graphs, and one- and two-parametric bifurcation diagrams. The computation of the largest Lyapunov exponent and a sketch of Poincare maps verify the chaotic character of the proposed system. On varying the parametric values, the system exhibits phenomena like multistability and the enrichment paradox, which are the basic qualities of non-linear models. Thus, the current study can also help ecologists to estimate the parameters to study and obtain such important findings related to non-linear PZF systems. Therefore, from a biological and mathematical perspective, the analysis and the corresponding results of this article appear to be rich and interesting.","10.1063/5.0069474     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","PREDATOR-PREY SYSTEM;DYNAMICS;RISK;COMPETITION;STABILITY;IMPACT;Food Additives;Phytoplankton","Shawn","Included"

Because the life cycle of prey species is memory, the fractional calculus equation is considered to study the dynamic behavior of the proposed system. The sufficient conditions to ensure the existence and uniqueness of the system solution are found, and the legitimacy and well posedness in the biological sense of the system solution, such as nonnegativity and boundedness, are proved. The stability of all equilibrium points of the system is analyzed by an eigenvalue analysis method, and it is proved that the system generates Hopf bifurcation nearby the coexistence equilibrium with regard to three parameters: the fear coefficient k, the rate of prey shelters p, and the order of fractional derivative q. Compared with the integer derivative, the system dynamics in the situation of fractional derivative is more stable. We observe an interesting phenomenon through the simulation: with the increase in the level of the fear effect, the stability of the positive equilibrium point changes from stable to unstable and then to stable. At this time, there are two Hopf branches nearby the positive equilibrium point with respect to the fear coefficient k, and the system can be in a stable state at very low or high level of the fear effect. In addition, when the order of the fractional differential equation of the system decreases continuously, the stability of the system will change from unstable to stable, especially in the case of low-level fear caused by predators and low rate of prey shelters.

Different experimental shreds of evidence validate that the presence of the predator strongly affects the physiological behaviour of prey individuals and dramatically reduces their reproduction rate. In this study, we investigate the interplay between the level of fear and the degree of habitat complexity in a predator-prey model with two different shaped functional responses. We, therefore, develop the functional response using the timescale separation method, and the shape of the resulting functional response depends upon the monotonous property of catch rate, g(N) where N is the prey biomass. Whenever g(N) increases strictly, a saturating functional response occurs, but for nonmonotonic g(N), a dome-shaped functional response arises. For saturating case, it has been revealed that both prey and predator biomass may oscillate for lower levels of fear and a lower degree of habitat complexity. To stabilize this oscillatory behaviour to a coexistence state, we have to adequately increase the level of fear or degree of habitat complexity. However, for dome-shaped case, more complicated dynamics are observed. In this case, coexistence steady state, if exists, may be locally asymptotically stable for a lower degree of habitat complexity, but for intermediate values, the system is capable of producing multiple coexistence steady states with a bistable phenomenon between predator-free steady state and a coexistence steady state. Moreover, if the level of fear is sufficiently low, the system may experience a supercritical or/and subcritical Hopf bifurcation. In the dynamics of parametric disturbance for the degree of habitat complexity parameter, dome-shaped functional response predicts that disturbance may trap the system into a nearest attractor (either a large amplitude stable limit cycle or predator-free steady state); this can be overcome only by a larger alteration, or sometimes it is impossible to overcome (hysteresis phenomena), whereas the saturating-shaped functional response predicts a system resilience. For both the functional responses, a higher degree of habitat complexity always increases the extinction possibility of the predator, and no level of fear can compensate this biodiversity loss.","10.1155/2021/6427864     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","STRUCTURAL SENSITIVITY;SPECIES-DIVERSITY;MODEL;Prednisolone","Shawn","Included"

(2) What can experiments that introduce or remove predator cues tell us about the answer to question (1)?        Mathematical methods: These questions are addressed using a two-patch meta-community model in which predators and/or their cues are incorporated into a system consisting of a prey species and its resource. Predators and/or cues may be introduced to one or both patches.        Key assumptions: Prey species move adaptively to maximize their instantaneous rate of increase, but also make some random movement. Predators move randomly or do not move. Resources seldom or never move between patches. Consumer species have saturating functional responses.        Conclusions: (1) Adaptive movement can stabilize or destabilize the dynamics of the tri-trophic system. (2) Monitoring densities in a single patch may give a misleading indication of the global change in densities. (3) Adaptive prey movement in response to predator cues may increase or decrease prey density. (4) Predator introduction may cause an increase or decrease in the size of the prey population. (5) Short-term experiments with local measurements may greatly overestimate the impact of predators on prey and the behavioural component of that impact.

We show that the fear factor and diffusion in a ratio-dependent predator-prey model may show more complex dynamics than observed earlier. It is shown that when prey diffusivity is low, prey remains concentrated at different patches throughout the domain. However, prey density becomes low at the patches as they disperse at a higher rate. Mixed and stripe patterns are observed during the transition from a hot spot pattern at the lower prey diffusivity to a cold spot pattern at its higher value. Pattern transition is, however, completely opposite if the antipredator behavior is gradually increased. Our simulation results reveal that the spatiotemporal chaotic pattern may also be observed in the Hopf-Turing region of instability provided prey shows a higher level of antipredator behavior. The chaotic pattern of the Hopf-Turing region may be shifted to a spot type pattern of the Turing region depending on the refuge level of the habitat.","10.1063/5.0035130     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Prednisolone","Shawn","Included"

Also, we have considered a benefit from the antipredation response of the prey population y in presence of cost of fear.

Birth rate of prey in predatory region has been regarded as bifurcation parameter to examine the occurrence of Hopf bifurcation in the neighborhood of the interior equilibrium point.

The standard multiple scale analysis is used to derive the amplitude equations for the excited modes near Turing bifurcation threshold by taking the cross-diffusion coefficient as a bifurcation parameter. From the stability analysis of amplitude equations, the conditions for the emergence of various ecologically realistic Turing patterns such as spot, stripe, and mixture of spots and stripes are identified. Analytical results are verified with the help of numerical simulations. Turing bifurcation diagrams are plotted taking diffusion coefficients as control parameters. The effect of the cross-diffusion coefficients on the homogeneous steady state and pattern structures of the self-diffusive model is illustrated using the simulation techniques.

More importantly, experimental studies also ensure that the predator-induced fear (indirect effect) may alter much behavior of the prey even more strongly than the effect of direct killing via habitat changes, vigilance, foraging, and different physiological changes. Considering this fact, we analyze a delayed predator-prey system incorporating anti-predator defense. The interaction term has been modeled using Beddington-DeAngelis functional response (BDFR). We discuss the local and global stability, permanence, and non-permanence to comprehend the dynamics of the system. By constructing a suitable Lyapunov function, globally asymptotic stability has been established. We also demonstrate that a certain value of delay may cause Hopf-bifurcation and period-doubling route to chaos. It is shown that under certain parametric conditions, the gestation delay-induced oscillations could be prevented. Using Nyquist criterion, the length of delay has been estimated for which the stability continues to hold. Moreover, we find that spatial diffusion affects the critical value of the bifurcation parameter and demonstrate the existence of spatially homogeneous periodic solutions with the change of time delay. In addition, the level of fear also affects the dynamical behaviors of the delayed system with/without diffusion. These results indicate that the gestation delay induces oscillatory coexistence mode of the interaction between predator and its prey, which reveals the driving factors for the co-existence of predator and prey in the form of periodic oscillations in actual ecosystems.","10.1002/mma.8044     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","fear effects;gestation delay;Hopf bifurcation;Nyquist criterion;predator-prey interaction model;stability region;MUTUAL INTERFERENCE;POPULATION-GROWTH;DYNAMICS;RISK;ECOLOGY;FEAR;DISEASE;Prednisolone","Shawn","Included"

The model assumes the classical foraging predation risk trade-offs: increased activity increases population growth rate, but it also increases mortality rate. The model considers three scenarios: prey only are adaptive, predators only are adaptive, and both species are adaptive. Under all these scenarios, the neutral stability of the classical Lotka-Volterra model is partially lost because the amplitude of maximum oscillation in species numbers is bounded, and the bound is independent of the initial population numbers. Moreover, if both prey and predators behave adaptively, the neutral stability can be completely lost, and a globally stable equilibrium would appear. This is because prey and/or predator switching leads to a piecewise constant prey ( predator) isocline with a vertical ( horizontal) part that limits the amplitude of oscillations in prey and predator numbers, exactly as suggested by Rosenzweig and MacArthur in their seminal work on graphical stability analysis of predator-prey systems. Prey and predator activities in a long-term run are calculated explicitly.

Individuals can therefore face a trade-off between reproduction and predation risk. Here we use simple models to explore population-dynamical consequences of such a trade-off for populations subject to a mate-finding Allee effect and an Allee effect due to predation. We present our results in the light of populations that belong to endangered species or pests and study their viability and resilience. We distinguish several qualitative scenarios characterized by the shape and strength of the trade-off and, in particular, identify conditions for which the populations survive or go extinct. Reproduction can be so costly that the population always goes extinct. In other cases, the population goes extinct only over a certain range of low, intermediate or high levels of reproductive activities. Moreover, we show that predator removal (e.g. in an attempt to save an endangered prey species) has the least effect on populations with low cost of reproduction in terms of predation and, conversely, predator addition (e.g. to eradicate a pest) is most effective for populations with high predation cost of reproduction. Our results indicate that a detailed knowledge of the trade-off can be crucial in applications: for some trade-off shapes, only intermediate levels of reproductive activities might guarantee population survival, while they can lead to extinction for others. We therefore suggest that the fate of populations subject to the two antagonistic Allee effects should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Although the literature offers no quantitative data on possible trade-off shapes in any taxa, indirect evidence suggests that the trade-off and both Allee effects can occur simultaneously, e.g. in the golden egg bug Phyllomorpha laciniata.

It is shown that, when there is a single prey species with a refuge or two prey species with no refuge compete only indirectly (i.e. there is only apparent competition between prey species), that stable resident systems where all individuals in each species have the same ecotype cannot be destabilized by the introduction of mutant ecotypes that are initially selectively neutral. In game-theoretic terms, this means that stable monomorphic resident systems, with ecotypes given by a Nash equilibrium, are both ecologically and evolutionarily stable. However, we show that this is no longer the case when the two indirectly-competing prey species have a refuge. This illustrates theoretically that two ecological factors, that are separately stabilizing (apparent competition and refuge use), may have a combined destabilizing effect from the evolutionary perspective. These results generalize the concept of an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) to models in evolutionary ecology. Several biological examples of predator-prey systems are discussed from this perspective. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

However, it remains unclear what factors promote the evolution of qualitatively different defense strategies and when evolution should favor strategies that involve modification of multiple traits. Previous theory suggests that individual-level trade-offs play a key role in defense evolution, but most of this work has assumed that trade-offs are independent. Here we show that the shape of the behavioral trade-off between foraging gain and predation risk determines the interaction between this trade-off and the life-history trade-off between growth and reproduction. The interaction between these fundamental trade-offs determines the optimal investment into behavioral and life-history defenses. Highly nonlinear foraging-predation risk trade-offs favor the evolution of behavioral defenses, while linear trade-offs favor life-history defenses. Between these extremes, integrated defense responses are optimal, with defense expression strongly depending on ontogeny. We suggest that these predictions may be general across qualitatively different defenses. Our results have important implications for theory on the ecological effects of inducible defense, which has not considered how qualitatively different defenses might alter ecological interactions.","10.1086/655425     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","phenotypic plasticity;inducible defense;foraging-predation risk trade-off;predator-prey;evolutionary computation;RESOURCE-ALLOCATION;ECOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES;TRAIT COMPENSATION;FOOD AVAILABILITY;PREY SELECTION;SIZE;DAPHNIA;POPULATIONS;LARVAE;RISK;Prednisolone","Shawn","Included"

These models can be adjusted to provide very good fits to movement pattern data. Nonetheless, it seems that these models typically cannot explain how the observed movement patterns come about. This is because of a widely held but unverified theoretical principle; namely that correlated random walks cannot be optimized for typical foraging scenarios and so cannot represent archetypal, innate, evolved optimal behaviours. As a consequence a mechanistic framework to explain correlated random walk behaviour and to generate novel hypotheses about its evolution has not been formulated. This is a significant shortcoming because the key to prediction and understanding lies in the elucidation of mechanisms underlying the observed patterns. Here with the aid of a simple analytically tractable model it is shown how particular correlated random walk behaviours can, in fact, confer benefits to foragers that are acting under predation. Predation risks are ubiquitous. The mathematical analysis and the accompanying numerical simulations are the first to show that by varying their correlated random walks behaviour animals can control both their rate of energetic gain and the probability of encountering a predator, and can thereby optimize their expected total energy intake. This mechanism can provide selection pressures for particular habitat-specific correlated random walk behaviours and thereby shows that correlated random walks can have explanatory as well as descriptive capability.

Based upon this fact, we consider a tritrophic food chain model incorporating with anti-predation response (fear effect) and multiple time delays for biomass conversion from prey to middle predator and middle to top predator. We analyze the resulting delay differential equations and explore how the anti-predation response level affects the population dynamics.

In some cases, they are linked and predator and prey are also competitors (intraguild predation). I present a game theoretic model of habitat use by predators and prey under conditions of asymmetrical intraguild predation. This model predicts that when the diet of intraguild predators is restricted to intraguild prey and the resource for which predators and prey compete (the basal resource), co-occurrence is only stable when dietary overlap is low and productivity of the basal resource is not high. The addition of alternative resources for predators results in co-occurrence under all conditions. Variation in alternative resource productivity produces a continuum of intraguild prey distributions from matching relative habitat safety, to one that reflects both food and predation risk. When there is a substantial alternative resource for predators, the distribution of predators matches that of alternative resource availability while the distribution of prey is influenced by both habitat riskiness and food availability. The density and distribution of the predator's alternative resource thus influence habitat selection by the intraguild prey. This stresses the importance of indirect interactions in structuring habitat use in communities and the need to view habitat selection in a community context.","10.1034/j.1600-0706.2001.920315.x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","IDEAL FREE DISTRIBUTIONS;FOOD-WEB COMPLEXITY;ENERGETIC EQUIVALENCE;RISK;COMPETITORS;ECOLOGY;GAME;DOGS;Prednisolone;Ecosystem","Shawn","Included"

This is important because a prey animal might have inadvertently arrived at a patch on which a sit-and-wait predator is lurking, a common situation in many species of animals. In a simulation model, we explore how long the ambushing predator should wait before attacking the prey animal and how the prey animal can adjust its vigilance in response. We adopted a war-of-attrition framework where the predator selects randomly an attack time from a distribution to keep the prey guessing and where the prey also keep the predator guessing by selecting randomly a time at which to switch from high to low vigilance. We found that an evolutionarily stable solution can emerge in this game and has the following form under a broad range of ecological conditions: the predator attacks early and the prey adopts a high vigilance early and then switches later to a lower vigilance. The results indicate that antipredator vigilance may change as a function of time rather than being a constant value as assumed in most vigilance models. We conclude that the uncertainty that ambushing predators and their prey must plant in the minds of the other can have important consequences for the evolution of predator and prey tactics.","10.1093/beheco/arr181     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","antipredator vigilance;predator-prey relationship;time;war of attrition;WAITING GAME;BEHAVIOR;RISK;PATTERNS;RANDOMNESS;EVOLUTION;FLOCKING;War;Prednisolone","Shawn","Included"

Group foraging is generally considered as a strategy for optimizing this trade-off. Previous modelling studies assumed that group sizes were static and that all group members are informed of an imminent predator attack if one of them detects it. These models implicitly assumed that birds could estimate group size, and adopt a fixed rate of anti-predator vigilance scanning. Recent empirical results suggest that group sizes are generally dynamic rather than static and the group members are often unaware of another's detection of imminent attack. It has also been observed that vigilance rates are not static but change after the arrival or departure of another. Here, we present a model which allows feeding-group size (and individuals' vigilance rates) to vary dynamically, and investigate the implications which this has for the optimum trade-off between foraging and avoiding predation. We find that newly arrived birds should generally be the most vigilant and that vigilance rates should decrease after the arrival of another into the feeding group but increase after a departure. Vigilance rates should increase as the cost of predator attack increases or if the reward rate from foraging decreases. Vigilance should increase if predator attacks are more common but decrease if predators require a longer time undetected to approach the feeding group. In common with many experimental studies, we observe that vigilance rates decrease as the average number of birds feeding together increases. Hence, the main conclusion of previous works (that foraging in groups is an effective strategy for balancing the conflicting pressures of foraging and avoiding predation) is obtained by our model, despite relaxing several previously used assumptions. Finally, we discuss some of the open questions related to group vigilance and how extensions to our modelling framework might be used to address these.","","co-operation;flocking;foraging;game theory;predation;strategy;GROUP-SIZE;ANTIPREDATORY VIGILANCE;PREDATION;BEHAVIOR","Shawn","Maybe"

Sufficient and necessary conditions of spatial pattern formation are obtained for various functional responses between prey and predators. By mathematical and numerical analyses, we find that small prey sensitivity to predation risk may lead to pattern formation if the Holling type II functional response or the Beddington-DeAngelis functional response is adopted while large cost of anti-predator behaviors homogenises the system by excluding pattern formation. However, the ratio-dependent functional response gives an opposite result where large predator-taxis may lead to pattern formation but small cost of anti -predator behaviors inhibits the emergence of spatial heterogeneous solutions.","10.3934/mbe.2018035     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Pattern formation;stability;predator-prey model;anti-predator behaviors;bifurcation;global stability;SPATIOTEMPORAL COMPLEXITY;MUTUAL INTERFERENCE;GLOBAL BIFURCATION;PATCHY INVASION;SYSTEM;DYNAMICS;EXISTENCE;Prednisolone","Shawn","Included"

When predators are put back into the picture by allowing them to respond strategically to prey behavior, expectations about prey behavior can change.

Similar revelations undoubtedly await many well-studied aspects of the behavioral interaction between predator and prey. Most examples studied to date, both theoretical and empirical, require attention from this 'predatory' perspective.

Moreover, it is shown that the model with Allee effect undergoes the Hopf bifurcation and heteroclinic bifurcation. The Allee effect of prey species can lead to unstable periodical oscillation. It is also found that the positive equilibrium of the model could change from stable to unstable, and then to stable when the strength of Allee effect or the handling time of predators increases continuously from zero, that is, the model admits stability switches as a parameter changes.

In view of this, a mathematical model has been formulated incorporating prey refuge, where it is assumed that prey refuge is a function of predators availability in the system. It is shown that the model system is well-posed. It has been found that the hiding level and consumption rate of predators have a suitable interrelation between them. Both the parameters act as Hopf bifurcation parameters, but they play opposite role in case of stabilization of the system dynamics. Also, hiding level plays crucial role in maintaining the mean density of both the populations. Furthermore, as hiding behaviour of prey is not instantaneous, so a time delay, namely hiding delay has been introduced to make the model system more realistic and it is observed that the delay parameter destabilizes the system. Modelling approach through fractional calculus has been further deployed to study how the process of forgetting life history influences the dynamical intricacy of the population level dynamics.

If antipredator behavior is incorporated into such models it becomes very unlikely that prey death rate is a linear function of predator density. In addition, it is possible for the prey death rate to decrease, rather than increase, as a function of the population density of its predator. Decreasing predation rates may be common when the prey organism is attempting to accumulate resources for growth or reproduction. Decreasing predation rates are less likely when the prey organism is attempting to minimize mortality. These results and earlier ones on indirect effects generated by optimal foraging (Abrams 1984, 1991a, b) suggest that higher order interactions should be extremely common in natural communities.

We develop a model where generalist predators have consumptive effects (i. e., altering the likelihood of local prey extinction) as well as nonconsumptive effects (altering the likelihood of colonization) on spatially separated prey populations (metapopulations). We then extend this model to explore the effects of predators on competition among prey. We. find that generalist predators can promote persistence of prey metapopulations by promoting prey colonization, but predators can also hasten system-wide extinction by either increasing local extinction or reducing prey migration. By altering rates of prey migration, predators in one location can exert remote control over prey dynamics in another location via predator-mediated changes in prey flux. Thus, the effect of predators may extend well beyond the proportion of patches they visit. In the context of prey metacommunities, predator-mediated shifts in prey migration and mortality can shift the competition-colonization trade-off among competing prey, leading to changes in the prey community as well as changes in the susceptibility of prey species to habitat loss. Consequently, native prey communities may be susceptible to invasion not only by exotic prey species that experience reduced amounts of mortality from resident predators, but also by exotic prey species that exhibit strong dispersal in response to generalist native predators. Ultimately, our work suggests that the consumptive and nonconsumptive effects of generalist predators may have strong, yet potentially cryptic, effects on competing prey capable of mediating coexistence, fostering invasion, and interacting with anthropogenic habitat alteration.","10.1890/07-1024.1     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","behavior;competition;consumptive effects;habitat loss;invasion;metacommunity;metapopulation;migration;nonconsumptive effects;predator-prey interactions.;HABITAT DESTRUCTION;CONSPECIFIC ATTRACTION;DYNAMICS;RISK;CONSEQUENCES;COMMUNITIES;COEXISTENCE;DISTURBANCE;EXTINCTION;DEPENDENCE;Prednisolone;Mental Competency","Shawn","Included"

It is proven that the pest adopts several mechanisms for overcoming the predation pressure. Two such techniques which are not well studied in the literature are group defence, anti-predator behaviour in prey. Anti-predator behaviour of prey is a counterattacking technique, in which adult prey attacks the juvenile predators to reduce the future predation pressure. From the existing experimental studies, it is observed that the anti-predator behaviour of the pest can have adverse effects on the biological control programmes. One of the ways to overcome the loss due to anti-predator behaviour is to cater the predators with some alternative food. In this current work, we have investigated this aspect in a dynamical system framework. This study uncovers many fascinating phenomena.

These are captured by a mathematical model for the exchange of biomass between a structured predator population (continuous weight distribution) and a resource. Because the predator's mating success affects the amount of resources required for the production of offsprings and their future growth into mature organisms, it influences the flux of biomass between trophic levels. Under simple assumptions, the equations can be reduced to an equivalent unstructured predator-prey model in which the Allee effect modulates the predation rate: the mating probability multiplies the rate of predator growth as well as the rate of resource depletion. Implications of the Allee effect for the bifurcation structure and equilibrium densities are examined. The model is compared to a modified version in which the Allee effect instead modulates the assimilation efficiency, hence the mating probability does not appear in the dynamical equation for the resource density. Both models exhibit qualitatively similar dynamics. However, compared to the model in which the Allee effect modulates predation, the model in which the Allee effect modulates assimilation efficiency predicts (i) unrealistically inefficient resource assimilation when predator density is low, (ii) a higher risk of catastrophic extinction resulting from a change in the parameter controlling the strength of the Allee effect, and (iii) no possibility of an increase in population size when the density dependence is enhanced.

The presence of refuge for prey decreases predation risk and can have important impacts on the sustainability of a predator-prey system. The principal purpose of this paper is to formulate and analyze a refuge mediated predator-prey model when the refuge is available to protect a portion of prey from predation. We study the effect of the refuge size on the biomass ratio and extend our refuge model to incorporate fishing and predator migration separately. Our study suggests that decreasing the refuge size, increasing the predator fishing, and increasing the predator emigration stabilizes the system. Here, we investigate the dependence of Hopf bifurcation on refuge size in the presence of fishing or predator migration. Moreover, we discuss their effects on the biomass pyramid and establish a condition for the emergence of an inverted biomass pyramid. We perform numerical test and sensitivity analysis to check the robustness of our results and the relative importance of all parameters. We find that high fishing pressure may destroy the inverted biomass pyramid and thus decrease the resilience of reef ecosystems. In addition, increasing the emigration rate or decreasing the immigration rate decreases the predator-prey biomass ratio.

Despite frequent local extinctions, the predator-prey metapopulation persists and exhibits either large-amplitude cycles or small-amplitude aperiodic fluctuations. This chapter reviews how our understanding of predator and prey metapopulation dynamics in mites has been advanced by comparing laboratory experiments with both a ""baseline"" model and simulation models that break down the assumptions of the ""baseline"" model. The most critical assumptions are that: 1) habitat structure matters, but spatial configuration does not; and 2) local dynamics of prey and predator are deterministic, fully determined by the first colonization and always end in prey extinction after a single oscillation, followed by predator dispersal. The ""baseline"" model predicts multiple stable states, either with or without predators, when there are many patches that harbor only few prey. Stable predator-prey cycles surface, however, when the number of patches is low and can harbor many prey. Virtually all acarine predator-prey metapopulation experiments published to date have been done under the latter conditions and show metapopulation-level cycles that are either periodic with large amplitudes or aperiodic with small amplitudes. Simulations suggest the large amplitude cycles arise when survival in the dispersal phase is low, whereas the small amplitude cycles surface when survival in the dispersal phase is relatively higher, yet low enough to allow persistence of predators and prey at the metapopulation level. The ""baseline"" model is further analyzed to detect which factors cause persistence or extinction at the metapopulation level. Persistence was promoted by prey dispersal from predator-occupied patches, time spent by prey in the dispersal phase, interception of predators in predator-occupied patches, and heterogeneous colonization risks among patches. Extinction is promoted by predator dispersal after extermination of prey in a patch and time spent by predators in the dispersal phase. The relative importance of all of these factors is yet to be determined. Moreover, the relevance of spatial patterning of predator-prey interactions is much debated. Model-based simulations to analyze an experimentally established time series suggest that what matters to persistence is reduced discovery of prey patches, not the spatial configuration per se. However, the last word has not been said about this, since spatial predator-prey models suggest configuration to play an important role.        The ""baseline"" model is not evolutionary robust, in that its structure arises from individual traits that are not favored by natural selection. It is based on the assumption that first colonization is the single determinant of local predator or prey dynamics and that predator dispersal is delayed until after prey extermination. Delayed predator dispersal cannot evolve, however, when only the initial colonization of prey-only patches by a predator is taken into account. It also does not evolve in simulations with a model, parameterized for the acarine predator-prey system, in which not only the first colonization but also subsequent invasions are taken into account. However, observations on the behavior of field-collected predators show that delayed dispersal is the rule rather than the exception. We argue that delayed predator dispersal prevails in the field because local populations are subject to catastrophes which give predators little control over the exploitation of their local prey population. Hence, natural selection in the field will favor predators that exploit the local prey population as fast as possible and delay dispersal until after prey extermination.        The important lesson to be drawn from this review is that the insights came from comparing a suite of models that all differed in key assumptions from a comprehensive yet formal ""baseline"" model and from testing these models against laboratory experiments. Understanding the complex dynamics observed in acarine predator-prey metapopulations requires more than spotting an arbitrary caricatural model with a dynamic behavior that corresponds qualitatively to that of the biological system.","10.1016/S0065-2504(04)37006-6     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","HOST-PARASITOID SYSTEMS;METAPOPULATION DYNAMICS;KIN RECOGNITION;DISPERSAL;MODELS;STABILITY;AGGREGATION;MITES;EXPLOITATION;STRATEGIES;Mathematics;Prednisolone;Exercise","Shawn","Maybe"

The strength of migration of zooplankton increases with a rise in the abundance of predators and their exudates (kairomone). Recent studies span multiple trophic levels, which lead to the concept of coupled vertical migration. The migrations that occur at one trophic level can affect the vertical migration of the next lower trophic level, and so on, throughout the food chain. This is called cascading migration. In this paper, we introduce cascading migration in a well-known model (Hastings and Powell, Ecology 73:896-903, 1991). We represent the dynamics of the system as proposed by Hastings and Powell as a phytoplankton-zooplankton-fish (prey-middle predator-top predator) model where fish affect the migrations of zooplankton, which in turn affect the migrations of motile phytoplankton. The system under cascading migration enhances system stability and population coexistence. It is also observed that for a higher rate of cascading migration, the system shows chaotic behavior. We conclude that the observations of Hastings and Powell remain true if the cascading migration rate is high enough.","10.1007/s10867-013-9311-2     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Kairomone;Inducible defense;Diel vertical migration;Coexistence;Stability;Hopf-bifurcation;Chaos;DIEL VERTICAL MIGRATION;ADAPTIVE SIGNIFICANCE;PREDATOR;DINOFLAGELLATE;ZOOPLANKTON;BEHAVIOR;POPULATION;CHAOS;AGGREGATION;DINOPHYCEAE;Mathematics;Food","Shawn","Maybe"

We investigate the local and global dynamics of the model with emphasis on the impact of strong Allee effect. First, positivity and boundedness of solutions are studied. Then existence and stability of the boundary and interior equilibria are presented and the Hopf bifurcation curve at an interior equilibrium is given. The existence of a Hopf bifurcation curve indicates that if competition between the IG prey and IG predator for the basal resource lies below the curve then the interior equilibrium remains stable, while if it lies above the curve then the interior equilibrium loses its stability. In order to explore the impact of Allee effect, the parameter space is classified into sixteen different regions and, in each region, the number of interior equilibria is determined and the corresponding bifurcation diagrams on the Allee threshold are given. The extinction parameter regions of at least one species and the necessary coexistence parameter regions of all three species are provided. In addition, we explore possible dynamical patterns, i.e., the existence of multiple attractors. By theoretical analysis and numerical simulations, we show that the model can have one (i.e. extinction of all species), two (i.e. bi-stability) or three (i.e. tri-stability) attractors. It is also found by simulations that when there exists a unique stable interior equilibrium, the model may generate multiple attracting periodic orbits and the coexistence of all three species is enhanced as the competition between the IG prey and IG predator for the basal resource is close to the Hopf bifurcation curve from below. Our results indicate that the intraguild predation food web model exhibits rich and complex dynamic behaviors and strong Allee effect in the basal prey increases the extinction risk of not only the basal prey but also the IG prey or/and IG predator.

We devise predator-prey models to describe three mechanisms that can lead to IBPs: (1) well-mixed populations with large prey turn-over rate, (2) well-mixed populations with prey immigration, and (3) non-mixed populations where the prey can hide in refuges. The three models are motivated by the three ecosystems where IBPs have been observed.

In this work, the hypothesis that inducible defenses increase the stability of tritrophic chains is tested, through the numerical analysis of a continuous-time model that discriminate between defenses affecting attack rate of predators, and defenses affecting predator handling time. In addition, discrimination between feeding costs of defenses affecting attack rate, and metabolic costs affecting feeding requirement for zero growth are considered. System stability was examined by computing dominant Lyapunov exponents, and through continuation routines of bifurcation points. Background parameter values were taken from two published studies. Our results show that a tritrophic system will generally be stabilized by the incorporation of inducible defenses and by their associated costs, but a number of new outcomes were obtained. Different long-term behavior is predicted if either one or two prey populations exhibit defenses. In the latter case, the defense of the basal prey dominates the dynamics. Handling time based inducible defenses exert a stronger stabilizing effect than attack rate based ones, but also impose a higher extinction risk for top predators. Inducible defenses in particular and trait-mediated indirect effects in general can be important sources of stability in natural systems. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

There have been many theoretical and empirical studies investigating this trade-off, especially for birds. An important characteristic of a flock of real birds is the area occupied by the flock. Individuals feeding close together experience increased competition so that the feeding rate decreases. Widely spaced individuals may suffer a loss in vigilance efficiency, since communication between individuals is more difficult, such that the predation risk increases. A vigilance model is developed which allows birds to control their spacing (and so the area of the flock) as well as their vigilance rate. The best strategy for the birds is found under a variety of environmental conditions, under the assumption that each individual acts selfishly to maximize its own fitness.
