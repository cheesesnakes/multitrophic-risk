We broke foraging trails and examined two measures of behavioral change associated with parasitism: the time lapse until first appearance at the broken trail and the time focal animals spent exposed. We compared these variables among parasitized workers, unparasitized workers from parasitized colonies, and workers from unparasitized colonies. We determined if color differed among parasitized workers, unparasitized workers, and unparasitized soldiers by comparing head and body color against a color chart. Finally, we examined if lizard predators preferred parasitized workers over unparasitized workers in choice tests. Parasitized workers arrived at trail breaks significantly earlier and spent significantly more time exposed than unparasitized workers. In choice trials, lizards were significantly more likely to choose parasitized workers. We conclude that changes associated with parasitism increase the likelihood that termites will be eaten by the definitive host of the parasite. To our knowledge, acanthocephalans have not previously been reported to alter the appearance of insects or other terrestrial arthropods, nor have any parasites been reported to alter behavior or appearance of termites.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  15     Total Times Cited:  17     Cited Reference Count:  16 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",,ISOPTERA;Caribbean Region;Prednisolone,,

We monitored reproducing bearded vultures and checked the breeding success at different stages (laying, incubation, hatching, and survival at 2 months) of formed pairs. We then compared the success of each stage between eyries located in restricted and non-restricted areas, including weather data in our model. We found that the breeding success was similar in both types of areas, but that is was negatively impacted by precipitations, which may directly affect the ability of the egg or chick to withstand cold. We also focused on the potential disturbance of hunting parties on the behavior of bearded vultures and found no evidence that hunting was perceived as a threat by bearded vultures; they may in fact benefit from gut piles. Hence, our comparison of the breeding success between eyries located in restricted versus non-restricted areas shows no detrimental impact of human activities and calls for some studies to assess the effectiveness of restrictions in improving the breeding success of bearded vultures, as this species seems to show some degree of tolerance to human activities and may significantly suffer from harsh winter weather in this area.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  2     Total Times Cited:  2     Cited Reference Count:  85 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",,bearded vulture;breeding success;Gypaetus barbatus;human disturbance;hunting;Pyrenees;species adaptation;tolerance;LAND-USE PRACTICES;GYPAETUS-BARBATUS;BEHAVIORAL-RESPONSES;CROP DAMAGE;HUNTING DISTURBANCE;PREDATION RISK;BALD EAGLES;NOISE;WATERBIRDS;IMPACTS;Breeding,,

Additionally, prey have imperfect information on the whereabouts of their predator, which the predator should incorporate in its patch use strategy. I used a one-predator-one-prey system, puma (Puma concolor)-mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) to test the following predictions regarding predator-prey distribution and patch use by the predator. (1) Pumas will spend more time in high prey risk/low prey use habitat types, while deer will spend their time in low-risk habitats. Pumas should (2) select large forage patches more often, (3) remain in large patches longer, and (4) revisit individual large patches more often than individual smaller ones. I tested these predictions with an extensive telemetry data set collected over 16 years in a study area of patchy forested habitat. When active, pumas spent significantly less time in open areas of low intrinsic predation risk than did deer. Pumas used large patches more than expected, revisited individual large patches significantly more often than smaller ones, and stayed significantly longer in larger patches than in smaller ones. The results supported the prediction of a negative relationship in the spatial distribution of a predator and its prey and indicated that the predator is incorporating the prey's imperfect information about its presence. These results indicate a behavioral complexity on the landscape scale that can have far-reaching impacts on predator-prey interactions.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  89     Total Times Cited:  89     Cited Reference Count:  52 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Included""}",10.1890/08-2345.1     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),"behavioral response race;follow-up visits;Idaho and Utah, USA;landscape of fear;mule deer;Odocoileus hemionus;patch use patterns;predator-prey interactions;Puma concolor;risk;HABITAT SELECTION;MULE DEER;ACTIVITY PATTERNS;FORAGING GAMES;RISK;CONCOLOR;GERBILS;LANDSCAPE;MOVEMENT;TIME;Continental Population Groups;Prednisolone",,

But, traditional mass-action models of predator prey dynamics treat individuals as behaviorally unresponsive ""molecules"" in Brownian motion. Foraging theory should provide the conceptual framework to envision the interaction. But, current models of predator feeding behavior generally envision a clever predator consuming large numbers of sessile and behaviorally inert prey (e.g., kangaroo rats, Dipodomys, collecting seeds from food patches). Here, we extend foraging theory to consider a predator-prey game of stealth and fear and then embed this game into the modeling of predator-prey population dynamics. The melding of the prey and predator's optimal behaviors with their population and community-level consequences constitutes the ecology of fear. The ecology of fear identifies the endpoints of a continuum of N-driven (population size) versus mu-driven (fear) systems. In N-driven systems, the major direct dynamical feedback involves predators killing prey, whereas mu-driven systems involve the indirect effects from changes in fear levels and prey catchability. In mu-driven systems, prey respond to predators by becoming more vigilant or by moving away from suspected predators. In this way, a predator (e.g., mountain lion, Puma concolor) depletes a food patch (e.g., local herd of mule deer, Odocoileus hemionus) by frightening prey rather than by actually killing prey. Behavior buffers the system: a reduction in predator numbers should rapidly engender less vigilant and more catchable prey. The ecology of fear explains why big fierce carnivores should be and can be rare. In carnivore systems, ignore the behavioral game at one's peril.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  729     Total Times Cited:  743     Cited Reference Count:  46 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Included""}",10.2307/1383287     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Puma concolor;mountain lion;Odocoileus hemionus;mule deer;predator-prey dynamics;PREDATION RISK;PATCH USE;SPECIES INTERACTIONS;RESOURCE DEPRESSION;HABITAT SELECTION;PREY;BEHAVIOR;COMPETITION;CONSEQUENCES;GERBILS,,

We model predator-prey interactions in which prey adjust vigilance behavior to mitigate risk of predation and predators their derring-do to manage risk of injury from capturing prey. High derring-do increases a predator's likelihood of capturing prey, but at higher risk of injury to itself. For fixed predator derring-do, prey increase vigilance in response to predator abundance, predator lethality, and predator encounter probability with prey and decrease vigilance with their own feeding rate; there is a humped-shaped relationship between prey vigilance and effectiveness of vigilance. For fixed prey vigilance, predators increase derring-do with the abundance of prey and predator lethality and decrease it with benefit of vigilance to prey and level of prey vigilance. When both prey and predator are behaviorally flexible, a predator-prey foraging game ensues whose solution represents an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS). At the ESS, prey provide themselves with a public good as their vigilance causes predators to decrease derring-do. Conversely, predators have negative indirect effects on themselves as their derring-do causes prey to be more vigilant. These behavioral feedbacks create negative intra-specific interaction coefficients. Increasing the population size of prey (or predators) now has a direct negative effect on the prey (or predators). Both effects help stabilize predator-prey dynamics. Besides highlighting a common way by which predators may experience a food-safety tradeoff via dangerous prey, the model suggests why natural selection favors even small defensive measures by prey and hulky predators.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  4     Total Times Cited:  4     Cited Reference Count:  36 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Included""}",10.1080/15659801.2016.1207298     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),derring-do or predator daring;ecology of fear and fear management;foraging games;predator-prey interactions;risk of injury and risk management;tradeoffs of food and safety;DANGEROUS PREY;HABITAT SELECTION;VIGILANCE;COEVOLUTION;DECISIONS;ECOLOGY;GERBILS;FEAR;Prednisolone,,

Interactions between predictable fluctuations in night-time luminosity and the underlying risk-resource landscape shaped herbivore distribution, herding propensity and the incidence of relaxed' behaviours. Buffalo responded least to temporal risk cues and minimised risk primarily through spatial redistribution. Gazelle and zebra made decisions based on current light levels and lunar phase, and wildebeest responded to lunar phase alone. These three species avoided areas where likelihood of encountering lions was high and changed their behaviours in risky areas to minimise predation threat.

As tools for managing risk, clever prey can use time allocation and apprehension (redirecting attention from foraging to predator detection). One such foraging game occurs between gerbils and their predators on the sand dunes of the Negev Desert. Here, interacting species of gerbils compete for patches of seeds that renew daily by afternoon winds. In such circumstances, gerbils are expected to deplete resource patches over the course of the night, the predators are expected to hunt when gerbil activity is highest, and gerbils are expected to be most apprehensive when predators are most active and most deadly. We tested these predictions for gerbils in two field experiments using seed trays to measure resource depletion, gerbil activity and apprehension over the course of the night, between the bush and open microhabitats and at four moon phases (new, half waxing, full and half waning). Gerbils depleted seed resources more quickly in the bush microhabitat than the open and more quickly at new moon than at other moon phases. Gerbil activity at new moon was high throughout most of the night, but decreased towards dawn. In contrast, activity at full moon was generally low, but increased towards dawn. The two gerbil species Gerbillus andersoni allenbyi and G. pyramidum partitioned the night, with G. pyramidum visiting resource patches earlier in the night and encountering a richer, but more risky environment, and G. a. allenbyi foraging later in an environment characterized by fewer seed resources, but lower risk. The same pattern extended over moon phases, with G. pyramidum foraging relatively more at full and waning half moon. Apprehension by gerbils was higher early in the night than later and higher at full moon than new moon. Schedules of apprehension changed according to moon phase and may have differed between the two gerbils. Finally, apprehension was higher in the open microhabitat, although the opposite was true at the beginning of the night. This foraging game affects three trophic levels, including the effect of the gerbils on the availability and distribution of seeds, the competitive interaction between the two gerbil species and the predator-prey interaction between gerbils and owls.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  139     Total Times Cited:  142     Cited Reference Count:  47 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",,apprehension;ecology of fear;foraging behaviour;foraging games;game theory;gerbils;giving-up density;optimal patch use;owls;predator-prey interactions;resource depletion;risk of predation;temporal partitioning;vigilance;HABITAT SELECTION;PATCH USE;SELFISH SENTINELS;OPTIMAL FORAGERS;RISK;COMPETITION;RODENTS;COEXISTENCE;VIGILANCE;ECOLOGY;Gerbillinae;Prednisolone,,

Players may adopt different tactics as the associated costs and benefits change through time. Yet few studies have investigated the potentially simultaneous and dynamic nature of movement tactics used by both players. It is particularly unclear to what extent perceived predation risk mediates the fine-scale distribution of large and dangerous prey, which are mostly driven by bottom-up, resource-related processes. We built habitat use and movement models based on 10 years of monitoring GPS-collared grey wolves Canis lupus and plains bison Bison bison bison in Prince Albert National Park, Canada, to investigate the predator-large prey game in a multi-prey system. Bison did not underuse patches of high-quality vegetation at any time during the seasonal cycle even though wolves were selectively patrolling these areas. Rather, in at least one season, bison engaged in complex tactics comprised of proactive responses to the long-term distribution (risky places) and reactive responses to the immediate proximity (risky times) of their opponent. In summer-autumn, bison reduced the time spent in food-rich patches as both the long-term use and the immediate proximity of wolves increased. By demonstrating that wolf distribution triggers patch abandonment by bison, we provide a key element in support of the shell game hypothesis - where prey move constantly to avoid predators attempting to anticipate their location. In winter, a season of relatively high energetic stress, bison no longer abandoned food-rich patches as predation risk increased, while no bison responses to wolves were observed in spring-summer. Our work demonstrates the highly dynamic and complex nature of the predator-large prey spatiotemporal game, a key trait-mediated mechanism by which trophic interactions structure ecological communities.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  5     Total Times Cited:  5     Cited Reference Count:  74 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Included""}",10.1111/oik.06166     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),anti-predator behaviour;grey wolf;landscape of fear;large prey;plains bison;predation risk;predator-prey interaction;Prince Albert National Park;risky places;risky times;shell game;PREY SHELL GAMES;HABITAT SELECTION;ANTIPREDATOR RESPONSES;DECISION-MAKING;ANIMAL MOVEMENT;PREDATION RISK;PATCH USE;BISON;WOLVES;FEAR,,

We conducted experiments with one, two or three uncovered pools. Each pool had two available fish habitats: protected from predation but without food for fish, and exposed but with food. There were 15 goldfish in each experimental pool. One egret foraged in each aviary (none in controls). The egret moved at will among the pools. During six-hour observation periods, we observed, minute-by-minute, the distribution of fish among their habitats and the movement of the egret among the pools. In addition to compiling summary statistics of the behaviours, we counted the number of successful predation events and analysed the results to test their optimality.        Results: As the number of pools changed, the egret changed its foraging behaviour, moving among the pools in a way that maximized its capture success. The time an egret spent hunting correlated with the number of pools available, thus it captured fish at a higher rate when more pools were available. Regardless of the number of pools, egrets captured the same number of goldfish per pool per day. The time that fish used the exposed habitat was negatively correlated with the time the egret foraged in a pool. However, even in one-pool trials, goldfish emerged from protected habitat occasionally, which sometimes led to their capture.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  8     Total Times Cited:  8     Cited Reference Count:  28 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",,predator-prey behavioural games;optimal foraging;food patches;risk of predation;fear management;GOLDFISH CARASSIUS-AURATUS;SHOAL SIZE;RISK;ENVIRONMENT;INFORMATION;COMPETITION;ECOLOGY;FISH;Prednisolone;Food,,

Behavioural games can be influenced by differential predation risk caused by habitat patchiness in the environment. Patches may provide prey with a differential risk of predation due to the size of area that provides refuge. The predator has to respond to the existence of patches with varying degrees of predation risk because this variable affects the time they spend foraging in each patch.        Question: Will the predator and the prey respond optimally to each other in a behavioural game?        Methods: We conducted behavioural experiments in two identical aviaries (7 m diameter), each with three separate pools (1.52 m diameter, 0.60 m deep, similar to 1000 litres capacity). Each pool had two habitats, one a horizontal cover in the centre of the pool (the refuge), the other open water (the risky patch). We used little egrets (one per experiment) and goldfish (15 fish per pool) as predator and prey respectively. We used small, medium, and large cover sizes as refuge, thus manipulating the predator's killing efficiency. We assigned a refuge size to each pool at random. We then observed the behavioural games of both players for 6 hours per experimental day. We recorded the time fish spent in the refuge; the time fish took to return to open water after being frightened into seeking cover (refractory time); the amount of food consumed by the fish; the time the egret spent in a single pool; the time it took the egret to return to that pool after leaving it; the number of fish caught by an egret during each phase of the experiment; and whether a fish was caught while it swam in open water or hid under a refuge,        Results: Contrary to our prediction, the fish were more active in the pools with smaller covers even though that is where they suffered the highest mortality. The egrets did not differentiate between cover sizes, spending a similar amount of time foraging at all three pools. However, the egrets timed their visits to the pools with the three sizes of covers in a way that matched the fish refractory times in those pools. The egrets returned to a pool just when the fish were beginning to re-emerge from under the cover, thus maximizing their capture success.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  6     Total Times Cited:  6     Cited Reference Count:  52 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",,cover;differential risk;killing efficiency;optimal foraging;predator-prey behavioural games;refuge from predation;risk of predation;HABITAT SELECTION;RESOURCE DEPLETION;TIME ALLOCATION;DIET SELECTION;GROUP-SIZE;GERBILS;BEHAVIOR;APPREHENSION;INFORMATION;AVOIDANCE;Prednisolone,,

Depending on the spatial structure of this ""landscape"", i.e., whether it is coarse- or fine-grained, prey may respond to increased risk by shifting their home ranges or by fine-scale redistributions within these ranges, respectively. We studied how wild boar (Sus scrofa L., 1758) responded to temporal changes in risk in hunted areas (risky habitat) surrounding a nature reserve (refuge habitat). Animals with home ranges ""in contact"" with the reserve during the low-risk season were the only ones to shift toward the refuge when the risk increased. These shifts occurred at two temporal scales in response to the increased risk during the daytime and during the hunting season. Whereas animals not influenced by the reserve found food and shelter in forest during the hunting season, shifts to the refuge area were detrimental to the rather scarce forest areas in the reserve. This confirms that spatiotemporal changes in risk are major drivers of animal distribution when predation strongly limits their fitness. Their response is, however, scale-dependent and reflects at the individual level the perceived structure of their ""landscape of fear"".","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  111     Total Times Cited:  112     Cited Reference Count:  48 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1139/Z09-101     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),BOAR SUS-SCROFA;YELLOWSTONE-NATIONAL-PARK;HOME-RANGE;HABITAT SELECTION;STRUCTURAL-CHANGE;WILD BOARS;BEHAVIOR;ECOLOGY;POPULATION;WOLVES;Prednisolone,,

The design features were analysed in relation to the consumer rights and guarantees described in the terms of use agreements of the patent assignees. The analysis revealed that some in-game purchasing systems could be characterized as unfair or exploitative. These systems describe tactics that capitalize on informational advantages (e.g., behavioral tracking) and data manipulation (e.g., price manipulation) to optimize offers to incentivize continuous spending, while offering limited or no guarantees or protections (e.g., refund entitlement), with the potential to exploit vulnerable players (e.g., adolescents, problematic garners). These findings are critically discussed in relation to behavioral economics, addiction psychology, and the clinical conceptualization of gaming disorder.

For instance, predator presence can alter prey behaviour, physiology, morphology and/or development. Despite a burgeoning literature, our ability to identify general patterns in prey behavioural responses may be influenced by the inconsistent methodologies of predator cue experiments used to assess trait-mediated effects. We therefore conducted a meta-analysis to highlight variables (e. g. water type, predator husbandry, exposure time) that may influence invertebrate prey's behavioural responses to fish predator cues. This revealed that changes in prey activity and refuge use were remarkably consistent overall, despite wide differences in experimental methodologies. Our meta-analysis shows that invertebrates altered their behaviour to predator cues of both fish that were fed the focal invertebrate and those that were fed other prey types, which suggests that invertebrates were not responding to specific diet information in the fish cues. Invertebrates also altered their behaviour regardless of predator cue addition regimes and fish satiation levels. Cue intensity and exposure time did not have significant effects on invertebrate behaviour. We also highlight that potentially confounding factors, such as parasitism, were rarely recorded in sufficient detail to assess the magnitude of their effects. By examining the likelihood of detecting trait-mediated effects under large variations in experimental design, our study demonstrates that trait-mediated effects are likely to have pervasive and powerful influences in nature.

The leafminer-parasitoid interaction bears a strong resemblance to the princess-monster game developed in game theory, in which a ""monster"" (parasitoid) selects an optimal search strategy to capture the ""princess"" (leafminer), while the princess selects an optimal strategy to hide from the monster. This article attempts to illustrate and to quantify the additional complexity that occurs when the princess can modify the arena in which the monster searches. Feeding activity of the leafminer Phyllonorycter malella creates feeding windows, which are spots on the mine. Its main parasitoid Sympiesis sericeicornis is able to insert its ovipositor only through these feeding windows. Parasitism risk depends both un the leafminer-feeding pattern, which determines the structure of the arena in which the parasitoid searches, and on the position of the leafminer within the mine. The adaptive value of observed patterns of mine development and leafminer behavior is evaluated by comparing them to predictions from a simulation model of random patterns and leafminer positions. The leafminer creates a heterogeneous environment by leaving a central area of uneaten tissue. This area acts as a protecting shield and greatly diminishes the risk of parasitism. Hence, by controlling the structure of the arena in which the princess-monster game is played, the leafminer defines some of the rules of the game.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  34     Total Times Cited:  34     Cited Reference Count:  37 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1086/303388     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),leafminer;risk of predation;feeding behavior;game theory;parasitoid;evasive behavior;PREDATION-RISK;TRADE-OFF;LEAFMINER;VIBRATIONS;BEHAVIOR;RESISTANCE;EVOLUTION;DEFENSES,,

This often leads to a negative spatial relationship between prey and predator in which prey avoid the most risky sites in the landscape. In this paper, we argue that our understanding of large carnivore-ungulate interactions is biased by studies from highly heterogeneous landscapes (e.g. the Yellowstone National Park). Due to a high availability of refuges and foraging sites in such landscapes, prey are able to reduce predation risk by showing habitat shifts. Besides the spatial heterogeneity at the landscape scale, the ungulate response to predation risk can be affected by the hunting mode (stalking vs. cursorial) of the predator. We propose that prey cannot easily avoid predation risk by moving to less risky habitats in more homogenous landscapes with concentrated food resources, especially where the large carnivores' assemblage includes both stalking and cursorial species. No distinct refuges for prey may occur in such landscapes due to equally high accessibility to predators in all habitats, while concentrated resources make prey distribution more predictable. We discuss a model of a densely forested landscape based on a case study of the Bialowieza Primeval Forest, Poland. Within this landscape, ungulates focus their foraging activity on small food-rich forest gaps, which turn out to be ""death traps"" as the gaps are primarily targeted by predators (stalking lynx and cursorial wolf) while hunting. No alternative of moving to low predation risk areas exist for prey due to risk from wolves in surrounding closed-canopy forest. As a result, the prey is exposed to constant high predation pressure in contrast to heterogeneous landscapes with less concentrated resources and more refuge areas. Future research should focus on explaining how ungulates are coping with predation risk in these landscapes that offer little choice of escaping predation by considering behavioural and physiological (e.g. metabolic, hormonal) responses.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  43     Total Times Cited:  43     Cited Reference Count:  82 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s13364-015-0229-x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Anti-predator response;Behaviourally mediated risk effects;Ecology of fear;Habitat selectivity;Indirect predation effect;BIALOWIEZA PRIMEVAL FOREST;YELLOWSTONE-NATIONAL-PARK;PUMAS PUMA-CONCOLOR;PREY SHELL GAMES;PREDATION RISK;HABITAT SELECTION;PATCH USE;EURASIAN LYNX;ANTIPREDATOR RESPONSE;WOLF REINTRODUCTION;Fear,,

Measuring these perceived risks from the perspective of the forager can produce a heatmap or their ""fear"" in the environments, a so-called ""landscape of fear"" (LOF). In an intercontinental comparison of rodents from the Mojave and Negev Deserts, we set to compare families that are used regularly as examples of convergent evolution, heteromyid and gerbilline respectively. Using a LOF spatial-analysis on data collected from common garden experiments in a semi-natural arena we asked: (1) do all four species understand the risk similarly in the exact same physical environment; (2) does relative relation between species affect the way species draw their LOFs, or does the evolutionary niche of a species have a greater impact on its LOF?; and (3) does predator facilitation between vipers and barn owls cause similar changes to the shape of the measured LOFs. For stronger comparative power we mapped the LOF of the rodents under two levels of risk: low risk (snakes only) and high risk (snakes and barn owls). We found concordance in the way all four species assessed risk in the arena. However, the patterns observed in the LOFs of each rodent family were different, and the way the topographic shape of the LOF changed when owls were introduced varied by species.

It is assumed that the predator consumes prey via simplified Hotting Type-IV functional response. We evaluate the equilibrium points and study the local and global stability behavior of the system around them. It is observed that our system undergoes Hopf-bifurcation with respect to the fear parameter. Moreover, the system shows the attribute of bi-stability involving two stable equilibriums. Further, we study the dynamics of the delayed system by incorporating fear response delay and gestation delay. We observe that the delayed system suffers Hopf-bifurcation with respect to both delays. Using the normal form method and center manifold theory, the direction and stability of Hopf-bifurcation are studied. Chaotic behavior for delayed system is observed for large values of fear response delay. All these findings are supported by numerical simulation.

We investigate how prey should behave in the face of danger from higher predator biomass, and how anti-predator behavior (in the form of vigilance) can, in turn, affect the predator-prey system. In this study, we incorporate anti-predator behaviors into a Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model in the form of fixed and facultative vigilance. Facultative vigilance models behavior as a dynamic foraging game, allowing us to assess optimal behavioral responses in the context of IBPs using a dynamical fitness optimization approach. We model vigilance as a tradeoff between safety and either the prey's maximum growth rate or its carrying capacity. We assess the population dynamics of predators and prey with fear responses, and investigate the role fear plays on trophic structure. We found that the ecology of fear plays an important role in predator-prey systems, impacting trophic structure and the occurrence of IBPs. Fixed vigilance works against IBP structure by always reducing the predator-prey biomass ratio at equilibrium with increasing levels of vigilance. Facultative vigilance can actually promote IBPs, as prey can now adjust their vigilance levels to cope with increased predation and the costs associated with vigilance. This is especially true when the effectiveness of vigilance is low and predators are very lethal. In general, these trends are true whether the costs of vigilance are felt on the prey's maximum growth rate or its carrying capacity. Just as the ecology of fear, when first introduced, was used to explain why top carnivores are rare in terrestrial systems, it can also be used to understand how big fierce predators can be common in IBPs.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  3     Total Times Cited:  3     Cited Reference Count:  60 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Included""}",10.1111/oik.06948     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),anti-predator behavior;conservation;dynamics;ecology of fear;inverted biomass pyramid;predator-prey dynamics;trophic levels;vigilance;PREDATION RISK;ANTIPREDATOR BEHAVIOR;PHASE-SHIFTS;CORAL-REEFS;PATCH USE;FOOD;RESILIENCE;STABILITY;HERBIVORY;DYNAMICS,,

Because an animal rarely encounters threatening stimuli in isolation, multiple disturbances can act in non-independent ways to shape an animal's landscape of fear, making it challenging to isolate their effects for effective and targeted management. We present extensions to an existing behavioral agent-based model (ABM) to use as an inverse modeling approach to test, in a scenario-sensitivity analysis, whether threatened Alberta boreal caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) differentially respond to industrial features (linear features, forest cutblocks, wellsites) and their attributes: presence, density, harvest age, and wellsite activity status. The spatially explicit ABM encapsulates predation risk, heterogeneous resource distribution, and species-specific energetic requirements, and successfully recreates the general behavioral mechanisms driving habitat selection. To create various industry-driven, predation-risk landscape scenarios for the sensitivity analysis, we allowed caribou agents to differentially perceive and respond to industrial features and their attributes. To identify which industry had the greatest relative influence on caribou habitat use and spatial distribution, simulated caribou movement patterns from each of the scenarios were compared with those of actual caribou from the study area, using a pattern-oriented, multi-response optimization approach. Results revealed caribou have incorporated forestry- and oil and gas features into their landscape of fear that distinctly affect their spatial and energetic responses. The presence of roads, pipelines and seismic lines, and, to a minor extent, high-density cutblocks and active wellsites, all contributed to explaining caribou behavioral responses. Our findings also indicated that both industries produced interaction effects, jointly impacting caribou spatial and energetic patterns, as no one feature could adequately explain anti-predator movement responses. We demonstrate that behavior-based ABMs can be applied to understanding, assessing, and isolating non-consumptive anthropogenic impacts, in support of wildlife management. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We consider that the growth rate of intraguild prey (IG prey) is reduced due to the cost of fear of intraguild predator (IG predator), and the growth rate of basal prey is suppressed due to the cost of fear of both the IG prey and the IG predator. The basic mathematical results such as positively invariant space, boundedness of the solutions, persistence of the system have been investigated. We further analyze the existence and local stability of the biologically feasible equilibrium points, and also study the Hopf-bifurcation analysis of the system with respect to the fear parameter. The direction of Hopf-bifurcation and the stability properties of the periodic solutions have also been investigated. We observe that in the absence of fear, omnivory produces chaos in a three-species food chain system. However, fear can stabilize the chaos thus obtained. We also observe that the system shows bistability behavior between IG prey free equilibrium and IG predator free equilibrium, and bistability between IG prey free equilibrium and interior equilibrium. Furthermore, we observe that for a suitable set of parameter values, the system may exhibit multiple stable limit cycles.

Predators manage their hunting success with behavioral tools such as habitat selection, time allocation, and perhaps daring-the willingness to risk injury to increase hunting success. A predator's level of daring should be state dependent: the hungrier it is, the more it should be willing to risk injury to better capture prey. We ask, in a foraging game, will a hungry predator be more willing to risk injury while hunting? We performed an experiment in an outdoor vivarium in which barn owls (Tyto alba) were allowed to hunt Allenby's gerbils (Gerbillus andersoni allenbyi) from a choice of safe and risky patches. Owls were either well fed or hungry, representing the high and low state, respectively. We quantified the owls' patch use behavior. We predicted that hungry owls would be more daring and allocate more time to the risky patches. Owls preferred to hunt in the safe patches. This indicates that owls manage risk of injury by avoiding the risky patches. Hungry owls doubled their attacks on gerbils, but directed the added effort mostly toward the safe patch and the safer, open areas in the risky patch. Thus, owls dared by performing a risky action-the attack maneuver-more times, but only in the safest places-the open areas. We conclude that daring can be used to manage risk of injury and owls implement it strategically, in ways we did not foresee, to minimize risk of injury while maximizing hunting success.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  17     Total Times Cited:  17     Cited Reference Count:  52 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s00442-014-2956-0     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Behavioral indicators;Predator-prey interactions;Daring;Risk of injury;Tradeoffs of food and safety;TIME ALLOCATION;PATCH USE;HABITAT SELECTION;AVIAN PREDATOR;BODY CONDITION;BEHAVIOR;GERBILS;HUNGER;APPREHENSION;VIGILANCE;Risk Management;Prednisolone,,

Following recent models of search and pursuit, we assume the prey has a fixed number of heterogeneous 'hiding' places (for example, ice holes for a seal to breathe) and that the predator (maybe polar bear) has the time or energy to search a fixed number of these. If he searches the actual hiding location and also successfully pursues the prey there, he wins the game. If he fails to find the prey, he loses. In this paper, we modify the outcome in the case that he finds but does not catch the prey. The prey is now vulnerable to capture while relocating with risk depending on the intervening terrain. This generalizes the original games to a stochastic game framework, a first for search and pursuit games. We outline a general solution and also compute particular solutions. This modified model now has implications for the question of when to stay or leave the lair and by what routes. In particular, we find the counterintuitive result that in some cases adding risk of predation during prey relocation may result in more relocation.

Exposure to human activity can cause animals to avoid human dominated areas or shift temporal activity patterns, but repeated, benign exposure can also result in habituation of individuals. Habituation is typically viewed as a negative potential consequence of human interactions with wildlife, with effects such as increased vulnerability of habituated animals to predation. Concurrently, the advancement of the understanding of the ecology of fear has shown reduced fitness in species because of behavioral changes in responses to fear of predators including humans. Here, we test how habituation and fear drive the foraging ecology of brown bears (Ursus arctos) feeding on Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) in Southeast Alaska, USA. We used motion-detecting trail cameras at salmon spawning areas across a gradient of human disturbance to record human and bear activity at fine spatial and extended temporal scales. Higher human activity was associated with increased nocturnality of non-habituated bears, likely leading to suboptimal foraging, but had no effect on habituated individuals. For the top 20% of sites for which human activity was greatest, an average of 78.7% of the activity of non habituated bears was nocturnal, compared with an average of only 10.2% of the activity of habituated individuals. Habituation of brown bears in this system alleviated perceived risk and avoidance of human activity, allowing habituated individuals to overcome their fear of human presence and maximize foraging opportunities. While habituation may lessen some of the deleterious effects of human activity on large carnivores, the long-term effects of habituation may be negative, as habituated individuals may be at greater risk of depredation. Future research should examine whether habituated bears and their lower perceived risk of human activity ultimately experience smaller population-level effects of human disturbance than non-habituated individuals.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  18     Total Times Cited:  19     Cited Reference Count:  43 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1002/ecs2.1408     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),"diel activity patterns;fear-based effects;habituation;human disturbance;Pacific salmon;perceivedrisk;Ursus arctos;GRIZZLY BEARS;ACTIVITY PATTERNS;PREDATION RISK;HUMAN SHIELDS;SALMON;RESPONSES;PREY;POPULATION;DEMOGRAPHY;MOUNTAINS;Habituation, Psychophysiologic",,

We investigate all the biologically feasible equilibrium points, and their stability is analyzed in terms of the model parameters. Our mathematical analysis exhibits that for strong antipredator responses can stabilize the prey-predator interactions by ignoring the existence of periodic behaviors. Our model system undergoes Hopf bifurcation by considering the birth rate r(0) as a bifurcation parameter. For larger prey birth rate, we investigate the transition to a stable coexisting equilibrium state, with oscillatory approach to this equilibrium state, indicating that the greatest characteristic eigenvalues are actually a pair of imaginary eigenvalues with real part negative, which is increasing for r(0). We obtained the conditions for the occurrence of Hopf bifurcation and conditions governing the direction of Hopf bifurcation, which imply that the prey birth rate will not only influence the occurrence of Hopf bifurcation but also alter the direction of Hopf bifurcation. We identify the parameter regions associated with the extinct equilibria, predator-free equilibria and coexisting equilibria with respect to prey birth rate, predator mortality rates. Fear can stabilize the predator-prey system at an interior steady state, where all the species can exists together, or it can create the oscillatory coexistence of all the populations. We performed some numerical simulations to investigate the relationship between the effects of fear and other biologically related parameters (including growth/decay rate of prey/ predator), which exhibit the impact that fear can have in prey-predator system. Our numerical illustrations also demonstrate that the prey become less sensitive to perceive the risk of predation with increasing prey growth rate or increasing predators decay rate.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  28     Total Times Cited:  28     Cited Reference Count:  40 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.ecocom.2020.100826     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Fear effect;Hopf bifurcation;Anti-predator defence;Stability analysis;Average Lyapunov functional;RISK;SYSTEM;PERSISTENCE;STABILITY;DEFENSE;FOOD;Prednisolone,,

Well-posedness of the model system along with persistence criterion and the conditions of local stability of each equilibrium point have been established. Direction of Hopf bifurcation near the interior equilibrium point has been investigated. From model analysis, it is observed that fear induced by both susceptible and infected predators jointly determine dynamical complexity of the system. Fear induced by susceptible predators enhances the stable coexistence of the system whereas high amount of fear induced by infected predators destabilizes the system. It is also observed that the ratio of the birth rate of prey and the level of fear induced by both the susceptible and infected predators actively determine the topological behaviour of the system.

We looked for evidence of a state-dependent game between predators and their prey by simultaneously manipulating the hunger state of barn owls, and Allenby's gerbils as prey. The owls significantly increased their activity when hungry. However, they did not appear to respond to changes in the hunger state of the gerbils.

We studied the behavioral tactics of both players. The experimental theaters consist of three equally spaced pools, each with a shelter in its center. The fish can take shelter in a safe but foodless habitat, or swim exposed in the open that contains food. The egrets can move among the pools to catch the exposed fish. We investigated the importance of non-lethal effects versus lethal effects on predator-prey interactions. We created a variance in predation pressure by keeping the number of egrets fixed but varying the number of pools of the experimental theater between 1 and 3 pools. In all treatments, even when the egret was present, individual goldfish emerged from protected cover occasionally, exposing at least their heads and sometimes their entire bodies in apparent disregard for the possibly lethal consequences. We assumed that this behavior stems from the fish's constant need to collect information about its surroundings. The fish responded appropriately to the variations in predation pressure by changing their activity level outside the cover, i.e., the fish drastically and significantly reduced their exposure outside the cover, as well as the rate of peeping, as predation pressure increased. The results demonstrate the importance role of non-lethal effects, and how they drive the behavior of prey in response to predation risk, which in turn, drives the action of the predator in an asymmetric two-player game of stealth and fear.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  5     Total Times Cited:  5     Cited Reference Count:  46 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1080/15659801.2015.1059720     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),predator-prey interaction;foraging games;food patches;anti-predatory behavior;optimal foraging;predation risk;lethal and non-lethal effects;CARASSIUS-AURATUS;PREY INTERACTIONS;POECILIA-RETICULATA;WAITING GAME;GROUP-SIZE;PATCH USE;ENVIRONMENT;INSPECTION;FISH;INFORMATION;Prednisolone,,

This approach can be applied to predict the potential effects of such activities on animal behavior and individual condition that could lead, in turn, to alterations in vital rates and, ultimately, long-term population change. We developed an agent-based model to describe the effect of interactions with tourism on the behavior of bottlenose dolphins in Doubtful Sound (New Zealand). The model describes the temporal variation of the individuals' hidden motivational states, the way in which these states interact to determine the activity of groups of dolphins, and the feedback influence of the group's activity on individual motivations and condition. Moreover, it realistically simulates the movement of dolphin groups in the fiord. The model also includes tour boat behavior, incorporating the way key geographical features attract these boats. In addition to tourism effects, we accounted for the spatial heterogeneity in both dolphin activities and shark predation risk. The final simulation platform generated a realistic representation of the social and behavioral dynamics of the dolphin and boat populations, as well as observed patterns of disturbance. We describe how this tool could be used to ensure effective management of the interactions between anthropogenic factors and bottlenose dolphins in Doubtful Sound, and how it could be adapted to evaluate the effects of human disturbance on other comparable populations. We then fitted the dolphin component of the model to data collected during visual studies of the Doubtful Sound dolphin population between 2000 and 2002 using a Bayesian multi-state modeling framework. However, when the parameter estimates from this fitting process were used in the agent-based model, biologically realistic representations of the population were not generated. Our results suggest that visual data from group follows alone are not sufficient to inform such agent-based models. Information on the spatial structure of the animals' activities and an appropriate measure of individual condition are also required for successful model parameterization. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Even if the fear is sufficiently large, the prey can survive under the saturated fear cost. Moreover, the sensitivity of prey to predator will affect the population density of prey and predator. It is feasible to introduce the saturated fear cost and predator-taxis sensitivity into the predator-prey interactions model. In this paper, we obtain the threshold condition of the persistence for the proposed model and discuss all ecologically feasible equilibrium points and their stability in terms of the model parameters. Furthermore, when choose the fear level as bifurcation parameter, the model will arise single Hopf bifurcation point. However, when choose the predator-taxis sensitivity as bifurcation parameter, the model will arise two Hopf bifurcation points. In order to determine the stability of the limit cycle caused by Hopf bifurcation, the first Lyapunov number is calculated in detail. In addition, by the sensitivity analysis and the elasticity analysis, the saturated fear cost takes on the strong impact on the sensitivity for the model, and the predator death rate has a greater impact on the persistence of the model than the prey death rate. Our numerical illustration also shows that the predator-taxis sensitivity determines the success or failure of the predator invasion under appropriate fear level.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  24 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Included""}",10.1007/s00033-021-01659-8     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Predator-taxis sensitivity;Fear effect;Predator-prey;Hopf bifurcation;RISK;PERSISTENCE;Prednisolone,,

Mathematical analyses show that the fear effect can interplay with maturation delay between juvenile prey and adult prey in determining the long-term population dynamics. A positive equilibrium may lose stability with an intermediate value of delay and regain stability if the delay is large. Numerical simulations show that both strong adaptation of adult prey and the large cost of fear have destabilizing effect while large population of predators has a stabilizing effect on the predator-prey interactions.

Both prey and predators adjust their behaviours in order to gain the maximal benefits and to increase their biomass for each.

We investigate step by step the impact of hunting cooperation and fear effect on the dynamics of the system. We observe that in the absence of fear effect, hunting cooperation can induce both supercritical and subcritical Hopf-bifurcations. It is also observed that fear factor can stabilize the predator-prey system by excluding the existence of periodic solutions and makes the system more robust compared to hunting cooperation. Moreover, the system shows two different types of bi-stabilities behaviour: one is between coexisting equilibrium and limit cycle oscillation, and another is between prey-free equilibrium and coexisting equilibrium.

In this article, we investigate the impact of fear on the dynamics of an eco-epidemiological switching model. We observe that both the force of infection and the fear factor affecting prey's reproduction carry out destabilizing role, while the system regains stability if the level of fear on disease transmission exceeds a certain threshold. We obtain an explicit expression for the basic reproduction number R-0 and show that R-0 < 1 leads to the total eradication of infection from the system. We extend our model by considering the fact that after sensing the predatory signals, prey takes some time for assessing the acute predation risk. The time lags involved in reducing the reproduction success as well as the intensity of disease transmission depend on prey's physiology and their individual reaction norms to the fear of predator. To capture a more realistic scenario, we construct the forced model by seasonally varying the costs of fear, disease transmission rate and the degree of preference of predator. Seasonal patterns in these intrinsic parameters add complexity to the ecosystem functioning by inducing higher periodic and chaotic oscillations. The chaotic behaviour is also observed in the forced system for the delay in the fear effect on prey's reproduction. However, time lag in the fear effect on the infection dynamics potentially suppresses the prevalence of such chaotic disorder. Thus, our findings may help to provide important ecological insights into the dynamics of predator-prey interactions involving parasites.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  7     Total Times Cited:  7     Cited Reference Count:  54 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s11071-021-06396-1     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Predator-prey model;Disease;Fear;Switching;Time delay;Seasonality;Prednisolone;Seasons,,

For the corresponding steady-state problem, we obtain sufficient conditions for the existence of positive steady states, and then study the effects of functional responses and the cost of fear on the existence, stability and number of positive steady states. We also discuss the effects of spatial heterogeneity and spatial diffusion on the dynamic behavior and establish asymptotic profiles of positive steady states as the diffusion rate of prey or predator individuals approaches zero or infinity. Our theoretical results suggest that fear plays a very important role in determining the dynamic behavior of the models, and it is necessary to revisit existing predator-prey models by incorporating the cost of fear.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  30 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Included""}",,Predator-prey model;fear cost;spatial diffusion;environmental heterogeneity;STEADY-STATES;NATURAL ENEMIES;GENERALIST;SPECIALIST;Prednisolone,,

The logistically growing prey population is divided into two groups: susceptible and infected. We take the fear of predators among prey population into consideration, which costs lowering of prey's growth rate and slims down the interactions among prey individuals. In our model, it is reflected by two decreasing factors of the fear parameter and the predator population: one in the growth term of the susceptibles and the other in the disease transmission term. We choose a general disease transmission function for which mass action, standard incidence, and saturation laws are particular cases. The predator-prey interactions are described by generalized Holling type-II functional response. We explore the effect of fear for three subcases of our model, all of which happen to be identical to three published works (without fear effect). Apart from the preliminary mathematical analysis of our model (e.g. positivity, boundedness, etc.), we find the conditions for existence and local stability of the equilibrium points and study Hopf-bifurcation around the endemic equilibrium point w.r.t. the fear parameters. We observe that fear can eliminate the chaotic oscillations of the system, produced in the absence of fear, by either making the endemic equilibrium regular (stable limit cycle or stable equilibrium point) or moving it towards the disease-free state. We also observe the presence of multiple attractors in the phase-space and different types of bistabilities. We perform extensive numerical simulations to explore the rich dynamics of our model.

The experiments were made in mice and revealed that the ACA is involved in both the acquisition and expression of contextual fear to predatory threat. Overall, the ACA can provide predictive relationships between the context and the predator threat and influences fear memory acquisition through projections to the basolateral amygdala and perirhinal region and the expression of contextual fear through projections to the dorsolateral periaqueductal gray.

But we did not determine whether they do so in response to variation in the density of the fish.        Question: Will the egret and the fish respond optimally to variation in prey density?        Methods: We used two identical aviaries (7 m diameter), each with three separate pools of water (1.52 m diameter, 0.60 m deep, similar to 1000 litres). In the centre of each pool was a single, solid disk (radius of 18.75, 22.75 or 36.75 cm) - the cover - which fish could hide under to protect themselves from egret predation. But fish could feed only in the risky habitat, i.e. the open water beyond the cover. In each 6 hour trial, the three pools had a single cover size and one of three densities of fish (10, 15, or 20) so that we could isolate the effect of number of fish from that of cover size. With high-definition CCTV cameras that yielded a panoramic view of the aviaries, we tabulated the behavioural data of egrets and fish every minute of each 6 hour trial - egret location and fish captures as well as the number of fish in each pool that were in the risky habitat. We also measured the number and percentage of food particles consumed by the fish. We counted the number of surviving fish at the end of each trial. We analysed these data parametrically using Python and SPSS.        Results: Fish swam in the open water much less when an egret was patrolling the aviary. Risk-taking by the fish in every control cell (no egret) exceeded risk-taking in its experimental counterpart. Risk-taking was correlated negatively with cover size. The highest number of fish in a pool (i.e. 20) was associated with the least amount of risk-taking. Neither the proportion of fish captured by the egret nor the tendency for risk-taking displayed by the fish varied at different initial numbers of fish in a pool. Cover size, initial number of fish and their interaction affected the number of per-capita food particles that remained at the end of experimental trials in complex ways. Contrary to our prediction, the fish in the pools with small covers left less uneaten food per capita. The egret captured a smaller proportion of fish as cover size increased. But the number of fish captured by the egret rose with cover size and declined with the initial number of fish. The egret spent more time in a single pool if the initial number of fish was higher, and it took longer before returning to such a pool. The more often the egret visited a pool, the less often fish ventured into open water. However, also contrary to our prediction, the fish were most active in the pools with smaller covers (even though they experienced the highest mortality there). All of these findings combine to optimize the egret's capture of fish during a trial.        Conclusion: The fish and the egret were locked in a behavioural game in which each player adjusted its behaviour to that of the other player.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  3     Total Times Cited:  3     Cited Reference Count:  36 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",,cover;differential risk;killing efficiency;optimal foraging;predator-prey behavioural games;refuge from predation;risk of predation;HABITAT SELECTION;TIME ALLOCATION;RISK;GERBILS;APPREHENSION;INFORMATION;AVOIDANCE;BEHAVIOR;FISH;Prednisolone,,

A predator-prey model with the effect of fear, refuge, and hunting cooperation has been investigated in this paper. The system's equilibria are obtained and their local stability behavior is discussed. The existence of Hopf-bifurcation is analytically shown by taking refuge as a bifurcation parameter. There are many ecological factors which are not instantaneous processes, and so, to make the system more realistic, we incorporate three discrete time delays: in the effect of fear, refuge and hunting cooperation, and analyze the delayed system for stability and bifurcation. Moreover, for environmental fluctuations, we further modify the delayed system by incorporating seasonality in the fear, refuge and cooperation. We have analyzed the seasonally forced delayed system for the existence of a positive periodic solution. In the support of analytical results, some numerical simulations are carried out. Sensitivity analysis is used to identify parameters having crucial impacts on the ecological balance of predator-prey interactions. We find that the rate of predation, fear, and hunting cooperation destabilizes the system, whereas prey refuge stabilizes the system. Time delay in the cooperation behavior generates irregular oscillations whereas delay in refuge stabilizes an otherwise unstable system. Seasonal variations in the level of fear and refuge generate higher periodic solutions and bursting patterns, respectively, which can be replaced by simple 1-periodic solution if the cooperation and fear are also allowed to vary with time in the former and latter situations. Higher periodicity and bursting patterns are also observed due to synergistic effects of delay and seasonality. Our results indicate that the combined effects of fear, refuge and hunting cooperation play a major role in maintaining a healthy ecological environment.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  1     Total Times Cited:  1     Cited Reference Count:  76 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Included""}",10.1142/S0218339021500236     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Predator-Prey Model;Fear;Refuge;Hunting Cooperation;Time Delay;Seasonality;INDUCED STRESS;SYSTEM;DYNAMICS;RISK;STABILITY;FOOD;BIFURCATIONS;UNCERTAINTY;SENSITIVITY;VIGILANCE;Prednisolone,,

Most risk avoidance behaviors, such as temporal avoidance, have severe trade-offs between foraging efficiency and risk reduction. Human activities are able to affect the species landscape of fear, by increasing mortality of individuals (i.e. hunting, roadkill) and by disruption of the clues used by the species to estimate predation risk (e.g. light pollution). In this study, we used an extensive camera-trapping and night-time light satellite imagery to evaluate whether human activities affect the diel activity patterns of 17 species of rainforest dwelling mammals. We found evidence of diel activity shifts in eight of 17 analyzed species, in which five species become 21.6 % more nocturnal and three species become 11.7% more diurnal in high disturbed areas. This activity shifts were observed for both diurnal and nocturnal species. Persecuted species (game and predators) were more susceptible to present activity shifts. Since changes in foraging activity may affect species fitness, the behavior of humans' avoidance may be another driver of the Anthropocene defamation.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  12     Total Times Cited:  13     Cited Reference Count:  56 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.biocon.2019.108257     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Atlantic forest;Avoidance;Brazil;Human activity;Night-time light;Nocturnality;Poaching;BOAR SUS-SCROFA;ATLANTIC FOREST;ACTIVITY PATTERNS;HUMAN DISTURBANCE;PREDATION RISK;FRAGMENTATION;STRESS;TIME;Humanities;Humanism;Humans,,

Similarly, a predator's optimal attack behaviour depends on its own satiation level and its assessment of the risks and costs associated with hunting. The optimal behaviour of each depends on what the other is doing, resulting in a dynamic game.        Assumptions: We assume that predators are more successful at hunting their prey when prey are further from safety, and that prey are more successful in finding their food items in more risky environments.        Question: Under these assumptions, what is the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) and how does it respond to false attacks by the predators?        Mathematical methods: We use stochastic dynamic programming to compute the probabilities of prey and predators surviving a foraging season (e.g. the winter) and game theoretical methods to compute the evolutionarily stable strategies.        Results: We find the ESS, and we demonstrate that when foraging time is limited, a predator benefits from making extra 'false' attacks on the prey, assuming it can do so safely and efficiently. The extra attacks disturb the prey until they can no longer afford the time for anti-predator behaviour and become easier targets during the next 'real' attack.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  13     Total Times Cited:  13     Cited Reference Count:  34 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Included""}",,evolutionarily stable strategies;game theory;killer whale;krill;Steller sea lions;stochastic dynamic programming;STELLER SEA LIONS;RISK;STARVATION;DECISIONS;ABUNDANCE;BEHAVIOR;ECOLOGY;DECLINE;SPACE;DEATH;Prednisolone,,

The role of hunting cooperation and the fear effect in the predator-prey system is gaining considerable attention by the researchers recently. But the study on combined effect of hunting cooperation and fear in the predator-prey system is not yet studied. In the present paper, we investigate the impact of hunting cooperation among predators and predator induced fear in prey population by using the classical predator-prey model. We consider that predator populations cooperate during hunting. We also consider that hunting cooperation induces fear among prey, which has far richer and complex dynamics. We observe that without hunting cooperation, the unique coexistence equilibrium point is globally asymptotically stable. However, an increase in the hunting cooperation induced fear may destabilize the system and produce periodic solution via Hopf-bifurcation. The stability of the Hopf-bifurcating periodic solution is obtained by computing the Lyapunov coefficient. The limit cycles thus obtained may be supercritical or subcritical. We also observe that the system undergoes the Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation in two-parameter space. Further, we observe that the system exhibits backward bifurcation between predator-free equilibrium and coexisting equilibrium. The system also exhibits two different types of bi-stabilities due to subcritical Hopf-bifurcation (between interior equilibrium and stable limit cycle) and backward bifurcation (between predator-free and interior equilibrium points). Further, we observe strong demographic Allee phenomenon in the system. To visualize the dynamical behavior of the system, extensive numerical experiments are performed by using MATLAB and MATCONT softwares.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  46     Total Times Cited:  46     Cited Reference Count:  51 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.ecocom.2019.100770     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Hunting cooperation;Fear effect;Multiple limit cycles;Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation;Bi-stability;Allee effect;TEMPORAL VARIATION;HABITAT SELECTION;PACK SIZE;RISK;ELK;STRATEGIES;STABILITY;RESPONSES;LIONS;Prednisolone,,

We propose a three-species food chain model, where the growth rate of middle predator is reduced due to the cost of fear of top predator, and the growth rate of prey is suppressed due to the cost of fear of middle predator. Mathematical properties such as equilibrium analysis, stability analysis, bifurcation analysis and persistence have been investigated. We also describe the global stability analysis of the equilibrium points. Our numerical simulations reveal that cost of fear in basal prey may exhibit bistability by producing unstable limit cycles, however, fear in middle predator can replace unstable limit cycles by a stable limit cycle or a stable interior equilibrium. We observe that fear can stabilize the system from chaos to stable focus through the period-halving phenomenon. We conclude that chaotic dynamics can be controlled by the fear factors. We apply basic tools of nonlinear dynamics such as Poincare section and maximum Lyapunov exponent to identify the chaotic behavior of the system.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  64     Total Times Cited:  65     Cited Reference Count:  76 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Included""}",10.1142/S0218127418500098     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Fear effect;chaos;Lyapunov exponent;multiple limit cycles;global stability;numerical simulation;PREDATOR-PREY SYSTEM;ECO-EPIDEMIOLOGIC MODEL;WEAK ALLEE;FORAGING BEHAVIOR;COMPLEX DYNAMICS;RISK;CHAOS;POPULATION;OMNIVORY;WOLVES,,

Moreover, we interrelate these two factors, through the predator-taxis sensitivity, as the total time or energy for foraging and defense is constant for prey. If the prey invests more time or energy for group defense, then reproduction may decrease due to that investment. We provide detailed mathematical results, including, basic dynamical properties, existence of positive equilibria, asymptotic stability of all equilibria, Hopf-bifurcation, direction and stability of bifurcated periodic solutions. We also provide some global features and possible occurrence of multi-stability in our model. Furthermore, we perform detailed numerical simulations to validate our mathematical results numerically. Our mathematical and numerical results suggest that the predator-taxis sensitivity should be less than some threshold density, for possible survivability of predator. We provide some sensitivity analysis of our model solutions with respect to the three important model parameters, namely, the predator-taxis sensitivity, level of fear, and the tolerance limit of predator. We can observe that the perturbation of the tolerance limit of predator has the greatest influence over model dynamics. Initially, the predator-taxis sensitivity has a positive effect on prey as its decreases the killing rate, however, for long run, its effect is negative on both the solutions, as it decreases the growth rate of prey, which affects overall fitness of both the populations. Our results may provide some useful biological insights on predator-prey interactions. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

A number of game theoretic models (joint ideal free distributions, IFD) have suggested that a population-level distribution of mobile predators and mobile prey in which predators match the distribution of the prey's resources and prey are more evenly distributed will be stable. However, prey can often manage their exposure to predation risk by adjusting their space use and their level of apprehension or vigilance, while predators have been shown to behaviorally manage the risk level perceived by their prey. We used a system of predatory larval dragonflies (Anax junius) and southern leopard frog (Rana sphenocephala) tadpoles to explore how these species respond spatially to habitat features when alone (non-game situations) and together (game situations), then how predation events are distributed in relation to these features. In game and non-game situations, dragonflies avoided each other and showed no preference for tadpole resource patches, while tadpoles favored their resource patches, avoided caged, feeding dragonflies, and used a combination of avoidance and activity reduction to reduce their predation risk. Predation events were generally distributed closer to resource patches and farther from caged predators. The results suggest that dragonflies and tadpoles do not directly follow joint IFD predictions, but manage fear and risk through their behavioral strategies. The results also suggest that stationary or slowly-changing habitat features can anchor predator-prey spatial distributions, but that they are likely to be temporally variable in some systems.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  10     Total Times Cited:  10     Cited Reference Count:  49 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1163/156853912X645087     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),dragonflies;foraging;ideal free distribution;landscape of fear;tadpoles;HABITAT SELECTION GAMES;PATCH USE;TEMPORAL VARIATION;DECISION-MAKING;FORAGING GAMES;SHELL GAMES;RISK;FEAR;DYNAMICS;BEHAVIOR;Prednisolone,,

When people search for resources together, individuals often find themselves in a producer-scrounger game, in which some individuals bear the cost of risk monitoring while others can free ride on those efforts. A theoretically rational strategy is to mix foraging and risk monitoring randomly with the same probability across all members, but such uncoordinated action often yields inefficiencies of under- or over-supply of risk monitoring in a group. Here, we examined whether people could spontaneously develop a coordinated risk-monitoring system, alternating vigilance and foraging in a pair. Given that human cooperation is vulnerable to fear of exploitation and emotional arousal under risk, we hypothesized that such sources of anxiety would be potential disruptors to coordination. In a laboratory experiment, two participants worked on a ""treasure hunt"" task simultaneously, in which they chose between low or high vigilance against predators during foraging without verbal communication. If one chose high vigilance with personal cost, it yielded a spillover benefit to the other. Besides behavioral choices, each participant's physiological arousal (skin conductance response) and cognitive effort (tonic pupil dilation) were measured during the task. Results showed that some pairs were actually able to develop a role-alternating system over time through tacit coordination, but coordinated action was also vulnerable to anxiety and mistrust among participants. Overall, these results imply that, besides the mutual behavioral control that often characterizes repeated interaction, cognitive control of emotional arousal may be a critical psychological factor for the emergence of coordinated cooperation.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  2     Total Times Cited:  2     Cited Reference Count:  49 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2019.05.004     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Coordination;Producer-scrounger game;Social foraging;Risk;Emotional arousal;Cognitive control;COGNITIVE LOAD;TRADE-OFF;TRUST;GAME;EXPECTATIONS;COOPERATION;EVOLUTION;Humanities;Humanism;Humans,,

Fear of middle-predator affects the growth rate of prey and the fear of top-predator reduces the predation of middle-predator on prey species. The prey and middle-predator are assumed to take refuge against predation. Numerical results confirm the stabilizing role of refuge whereas hunting cooperation destroys stability and induces limit cycle oscillations. We find that the fear of middle-predator on prey has tendency to stabilize the system while the fear of top-predator on middle-predator creates instability in the system. Further, time delays are considered in the processes of taking refuges and hunting cooperations. Delay in hunting cooperations creates multiple stability switches in the system. Furthermore, seasonal forcing of parameters related to refuges and hunting cooperations depicts a more realistic scenario. We investigate the behaviors of seasonally forced system in the absence as well as presence of time delays. The seasonally forced system exhibits different types of periodic solutions. Complex bursting patterns are observed due to periodicity in refuge of middle-predator (cooperation of top-predator).

Predator cues are routinely used to induce fear and anxiety in laboratory rodents for pharmacological studies. However, research on the fear response induced by predator cues in different species of rodents in the wild has been inconclusive with results often contradictory to laboratory experiments. Potential explanations for this inconsistency include the prey's: (i) physiological state; (ii) parasite load; (iii) differential intensity of perceived threats; (iv) fear learning and habituation; and (v) information gathering. In this review, we first explore current knowledge on the sensory mechanisms and capabilities of rodents, followed by the discussion of each of these explanations within the context of their implications for the use of antipredator response as a pest rodent management tool. Finally, we make recommendations on potential solutions and strategies to resolve issues in rodent management related to these hypotheses.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  26     Total Times Cited:  26     Cited Reference Count:  327 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.3389/fevo.2019.00136     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),non-consumptive effects;anti-predator response;fear;predator cues;learning;fear conditioning;pest rodents;TOXOPLASMA-GONDII INFECTION;2ND-GENERATION ANTICOAGULANT RODENTICIDES;INNATE PREDATOR-RECOGNITION;RATS RATTUS-NORVEGICUS;FORAGING BEHAVIOR;ANTIPREDATOR BEHAVIOR;LABORATORY RATS;PATCH USE;CAT ODOR;ULTRASONIC VOCALIZATIONS;Rodentia,,

However, aside from direct consumption, fear of predators could also increase vigilance and reduce time spent foraging as population size decreases, as has been observed in wild mammals living in social groups. To investigate the role of fear on fitness in relation to population density in a species with limited sociality, we exposed varying densities of Drosophila melanogaster to mantid predators either during an experimental breeding season or non-breeding season. The presence of mantids in either season decreased the reproductive performance of individuals but only at low breeding densities, providing evidence for an Allee effect. We then used our experimental results to parametrize a mathematical model to examine the population consequences of fear at low densities. Fear tended to destabilize population dynamics and increase the risk of extinction up to sevenfold. Our study provides unique experimental evidence that the indirect effects of the presence of predators can cause an Allee effect and has important consequences for our understanding of the dynamics of small populations.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  19     Total Times Cited:  19     Cited Reference Count:  52 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Included""}",10.1098/rspb.2017.0878     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),carry-over effects;Drosophila melanogaster;extinction risk;non-consumptive effects of predators;small populations;Tenodera sinensis;TROPHIC CASCADES;PREDATION RISK;DENSITY-DEPENDENCE;PACIFIC SALMON;REPRODUCTION;BEHAVIOR;CONSERVATION;MORTALITY;DRIVEN;PREY,,

Tools available to prey to manage risk include time allocation and apprehension. Such a game exists between gerbils and their predators in sandy habitats in the Negev Desert. Pulses of seeds made available daily by wind action result in a tightly choreographed game of changing seed availability and changing gerbil and predator behavior throughout the night. This outcome depends on summer conditions, especially the mobile sandy substrate that allows for daily renewal of resources. But winter conditions are far different: colder temperatures and wet, immobile substrate that stymies seed renewal. Here, we examined nightly patterns of time allocation and apprehension in gerbils in summer and winter. Gerbils showed higher GUDs (giving-up density, a measure of time allocation) and higher selectivity for full resource patches over micropatches (a measure of apprehension) in winter than in summer. Also, gerbils showed stronger responses of GUDs to moon phase and time of night in the summer and stronger responses of selectivity to moon phase and microhabitat in the winter. In summer, gerbils use apprehension and, especially, time allocation to manage risk; in winter, gerbils rely more on apprehension. These results show how a forager's use of time allocation and apprehension depends on the nature of resource renewal and the cost of thermoregulation while foraging. Such factors can vary greatly across seasons and result in very different tactics for animals managing food and safety through foraging behavior.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  25     Total Times Cited:  27     Cited Reference Count:  16 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",,PATCH USE;ECOLOGY;DESERT;MODELS;RISK;FEAR;Gerbillinae;Prednisolone;Seasons,,

However, the anti-predator strategy is not the same for all individual preys of different life stages. Also, anti-predator behavior has both cost and benefit, but most of the mathematical models observed the dynamics by incorporating its cost only. In the present study, we formulate a predator-prey model dividing the prey population into two stages: juvenile and adult. We assume that adult preys are only adapting group defense as an anti-predator strategy when they are sensitive to predation. Group defense plays a positive role for adult prey by reducing their predation, but, on the negative side, it simultaneously decreases their reproductive potential. A parameter, anti-predator sensitivity is introduced to interlink both the benefit and cost of group defense. Our result shows that when adult preys are not showing anti-predator behavior, with an increase of maturation rate, the system exhibits a population cycle of abruptly increasing amplitude, which may drive all species of the system to extinction. Anti-predator sensitivity may exclude oscillation through homoclinic bifurcation and avert the prey population for any possible random extinction. Anti-predator sensitivity also decreases the predator population density and produces bistable dynamics. Higher values of anti-predator sensitivity may lead to the extinction of the predator population and benefit adult preys to persist with large population density. Below a threshold value of anti-predator sensitivity, it may possible to retain the predator population in the system by increasing the fear level of the predator. We also observe our fear-induced stage-structured model exhibits interesting and rich dynamical behaviors, various types of bistabilities in different bi-parameter planes. Finally, we discuss the potential impact of our findings. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

One experiment presented egrets with 15 fish per pool. The second experiment used a heterogeneous environment: pools 1, 2, and 3 had 10, 15, and 20 fish, respectively. Within each pool, fish could move between a safe, covered microhabitat and a risky, open microhabitat. Only the risky habitat had food, so fish were trading off food and safety by allocating the time spent in the two habitats. Egrets spent more total time in pools with more fish and returned to them sooner. Egrets maximized the number of fish they captured by following the matching rule of the ideal free distribution. The fish used the risky but productive habitat 65% of the time during experiments without egrets, but only 9% during experiments with 15 fish and egrets present somewhere in the theater. In addition, with egrets present, fish fine-tuned their behavior by reducing their use of the risky habitat as the egrets increased the frequency of their visits.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  28     Total Times Cited:  28     Cited Reference Count:  58 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1086/669156     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),predator-prey behavioral game;fear management;optimal foraging;time allocation;temporal and spatial cognitive abilities;PREDATION RISK;GROUP-SIZE;RESOURCE DEPLETION;HABITAT SELECTION;DECISION-MAKING;DIET SELECTION;WAITING GAME;SHOAL SIZE;ECOLOGY;GERBILS,,

We study boundedness, persistence, local and global behavior of the delayed system. Moreover, the Hopf-bifurcation analysis around the interior equilibrium with respect to the delay parameter is established. The stability and direction of Hopf-bifurcation are also studied. It is observed that fear induced delay has both stabilizing and destabilizing effects depending on the magnitude of the delay parameter. We observe that for the gradual increase of the magnitude of delay, the system dynamics switches multiple times between stable focus and limit cycle oscillations. However, for a higher value of the delay parameter, the system ultimately enters into the chaotic regime. The delay system also exhibits node-cycle bi-stability behavior between the interior equilibrium point and stable limit cycle.

Habitat selection strategies translate into movement tactics, which reckon with the predator-prey spatial game. Strategic habitat selection analysis can therefore illuminate behavioural games. Cover types at potential encounter sites (i.e. intersections between movement paths of predator and prey) can be compared with cover types available (i) within the area of home-range-overlap (HRO) between predator and prey; and (ii) along the path (MP) of each species. Unlike the HRO scale, cover-type availability at MP scale differs between interacting species due to species-specific movement decisions. Scale differences in selection could therefore inform on divergences in fitness rewarding actions between predators and prey.        2. We used this framework to evaluate the spatial game between GPS-collared wolves (Canis lupus) versus caribou (Rangifer tarandus), and wolf versus moose (Alces alces).        3. Changes in cover-type availability between HRO and MP revealed differences in how each species fine-tuned its movements to habitat features. In contrast to caribou, wolves increased their encounter rate with regenerating cuts along their paths (MP) relative to the HRO level. As a consequence, wolves were less likely to cross caribou paths in areas with higher percentage of regenerating cuts than expected based on the availability along their paths, whereas caribou had a higher risk of intersecting wolf paths by crossing these areas, relative to random expectation along their paths. Unlike for caribou, availability of mixed and deciduous areas decreased from HRO to MP level for wolves and moose. Overall, wolves displayed stronger similarities in movement decisions with moose than with caribou, thereby revealing the focus of wolves on moose.        4. Our study reveals how differences in fine-scale movement tactics between species create asymmetric relative encounter probabilities between predators and prey, given their paths. Increase in relative risk of encounter for prey and decrease for predators associated with specific cover types emerging from HRO to MP scale analysis can disclose potential weaknesses in current movement tactics involved the predator-prey game, such as caribou use of cutovers in summer-autumn. In turn, these weaknesses can inform on subsequent changes in habitat selection tactics that might arise due to evolutionary forces.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  37     Total Times Cited:  37     Cited Reference Count:  48 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/1365-2656.12093     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Alces alces;Canis lupus;managed Canadian boreal forest;multi-trophic analyses;predator-multi-prey behavioural game;Rangifer tarandus;search tactic;wolf-prey encounter;HABITAT-SELECTION;WOODLAND CARIBOU;SPACE-USE;SHELL GAMES;PREDATION;MOOSE;ELK;ECOLOGY;MODELS;SCALE;Health Resources,,

Predators can affect prey population by means of direct consumption and by inducing a non-consumptive fear effect in the prey population. In our present study, we investigate the impact of an indirect prey-predator interaction by considering the effect of fear of predation coupled with predation-driven Allee effect on the prey population. We propose and analyze two-species prey-predator models where the growth rate of prey is affected by a combined non-consumptive Allee-cum-fear effect induced by the predator and due to two different foraging behaviour of the predator. We investigate and compare the dynamical behaviour of the systems with Holling type-I and Holling type-II foraging rates of the predator. We observe that the system with type-II foraging rate of the predator has a wider basin of attraction of the stable coexistence equilibrium compared to the system with type-I foraging rate. We also observe that due to the gradual increase of fear level, the systems exhibit oscillatory dynamics followed by multiple stability switching.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  4     Total Times Cited:  4     Cited Reference Count:  21 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Included""}",10.1007/s12190-019-01275-w     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Fear effect;Allee effect;Intra-specific competition;Foraging;Bifurcation;RISK;Prednisolone,,

Behavioural tactics used by adult seals appear to account for the variance in risk from sharks, while shark tactics seem more influenced by the behaviour of pup seals, probably because pup seals engage in riskier behaviours. A dynamic game model of the interaction predicts that, if pups and adult seals account for risk in a similar manner, then tactic selection used by sharks and seals should be more evenly distributed across all possible options. Instead, a second model in which pups were constrained to choose the riskiest option produced evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) solutions for both species that more closely approximated the tactics recorded, suggesting that behavioural variation within subgroups of a population should be accounted for when modelling predator-prey interactions. These results also suggest that pups may act as initiators in a behaviourally mediated indirect interaction with adult seals, mediated by the behaviour of their common shark predator; this would represent the first record of an intergenerational two-species indirect interaction.

In almost every ecological model, the prey species is curtailed by the direct attacking of predator species. However, from different experimental shreds of evidence, it has been observed that fear (felt by prey) for predators can change the physiological behaviour of prey individuals and greatly reduces their reproduction rate as well as enhances their mortality rate. In this current work, we develop and explore a predator-prey model incorporating the cost of perceived fear into the birth and death rates of prey species with Holling type-II functional response. In addition, the intraspecific competition within predator species and a gestation delay are introduced in the model to obtain more realistic and natural dynamics. Feasibility of all the steady states and their stability conditions are analysed in terms of the model parameters. We show that only existence of an interior equilibrium point is sufficient to prevent the extinction of predator species. In this case, either both species can exist together or oscillate around that interior equilibrium point. We can also recognize the parametric region where the system produces multiple coexistence equilibria in which different initial biomass of populations may produce different long-term outcomes. The basic bifurcation analyses of the system exhibit that a higher level of fear or higher intraspecific competition rate helps the population to survive in a coexistence state. For a suitable choice of parametric values, the proposed model may produce the bi-stable phenomenon between two coexistence steady states. We obtain a parametric condition for which the model system experiences a Hopf bifurcation if the delay parameter exceeds some threshold value. All of these theoretical findings are verified by various numerical examples. (C) 2021 International Association for Mathematics and Computers in Simulation (IMACS). Published by Elsevier B.V.

Here, the fractional calculus has been taken into consideration to investigate the dynamical behaviour of the solutions of the proposed model system as the changes in life cycle of prey species are of memory bound. Biological validation and well-posedness such as positivity and boundedness of solutions of the model system have been proved analytically. Stability analysis of all the feasible equilibrium points of the model system has been performed in a systematic way. Some important dynamical features of the model system (such as transition of stability of the system) have been demonstrated through rigorous numerical simulation. It is observed that our proposed model system experiences Hopf-bifurcation around the interior equilibrium point with respect to both the parameters f and m(1), which are linked with amount of predator induced fear and rate of prey refuge, respectively. The system dynamics is more likely to be stable in the framework of fractional order derivative in comparison to integer-order derivative. The high amount of predator induced fear f and prey refuge rate m(1) are independently capable to make the system dynamics to be stable in integer order model system. On the other hand, the dynamics of the model system shifts towards the stability from its unstable behaviour when we continuously reduce the order of the model system; especially under the scenario of low level of predator induced fear and prey refuge rate. Thus, our comprehensive mathematical findings reveal the fact that fading memory can play a contributory role towards stable coexistence of the predator-prey system whereas strong memory of the species deteriorates the stable coexistence of the model system.

In this study, we looked for evidence of such a state-dependent foraging game between intra-guild competitors. We studied a desert rodent system featuring 2 coexisting species known to compete with each other: midday gerbils (Meriones meridianus, the dominant competitor) and 3-toed jerboas (Dipus sagitta, the subordinate competitor). We simultaneously manipulated the energetic states of both species and allowed them to forage and interact in arenas with artificial food patches. We found that both species responded to their own energetic states, whereas hungry jerboas also significantly responded to gerbils' energetic state in terms of food harvest. Gerbils preferred to carry food items away when foraging alone but switched to on-tray consumption when jerboas were present. Jerboas harvested more food when gerbils were hungry and the most intensive interference occurred when hungry jerboas encountered well-fed gerbils. A plausible explanation for these results is that the future rather than current value of cacheable food is more important to well-fed gerbils. In contrast, hungry gerbils prefer immediate consumption to completely excluding jerboas from resource patches.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  3     Total Times Cited:  3     Cited Reference Count:  53 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1093/beheco/arw169     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),apparent predation risk;food handling;foraging game;foraging strategy;hunger state;interference competition;INTERFERENCE COMPETITION;HABITAT SELECTION;PREDATION RISK;FIELD EXPERIMENTS;ENERGETIC STATE;DESERT RODENTS;FOOD QUALITY;BEHAVIOR;GERBILS;COEXISTENCE;Aggression,,

The cost of these defensive strategies can include energetic investment in defensive structures, reduced energy income, lower mating success, and emigration which ultimately reduces the reproduction of prey. To explore the effect of these defensive strategies (anti-predator behaviors), a modified Leslie-Gower predator-prey model with the cost of fear has been considered. Gestation delay is also incorporated in the system for a more realistic formulation. Boundedness, equilibria and stability analysis are performed for the temporal system. By considering gestation delay as a bifurcation parameter, the existence of Hopf-bifurcation around the interior equilibrium point is discussed together with the direction, stability, and period of bifurcating solutions arising through Hopf-bifurcation. The spatial extension of the proposed model incorporating density-dependent cross-diffusion is also investigated and the conditions for diffusion-driven instability are obtained. To illustrate the analytical findings, detailed numerical simulations are performed.

We assume that zooplankton species have developed defense mechanisms against fish predation. The fear of fish predation altered anti-predator defenses, which affects the growth of the fish population. On the other hand, zooplankton refuge reduces fish induced mortality of zooplankton and plays a significant role in controlling phytoplankton growth. The density of fish species is suppressed in the presence of high refuge and the anti-predator response of zooplankton. It is determined that K and r(1) can influence not only plankton-fish demography but also induce some mechanism to terminate planktonic blooms. Our mathematical study reveals that the low level of fear can stabilize the system dynamics in the presence of high rate of zooplankton refuge. Moreover, the low rate of zooplankton refuge can exclude complexity from the plankton-fish ecosystem in the presence of strong anti-predator responses of zooplankton. We have established the existence of all feasible biological equilibria and derived the conditional local and global stability of the given system around it. The Hopf-bifurcation analysis is carried out by considering K and r(1) as bifurcation parameters. The direction of bifurcating solutions is also determined using the centre manifold arguments.

Few studies have distinguished between vigilance types when examining the effects of predation risk and, in the absence of a commonly accepted conceptual framework, the variables used to define predation risk vary greatly between studies. We investigated the relative importance of four predation risk categories (risky place assessed at the landscape and habitat level, vegetation characteristics at foraging site level, prey characteristics and resource availability) for the time spent on intense and routine vigilance by Burchell's zebra, Equus quagga burchellii, and blue wildebeest, Connochaetes taurinus taurinus, under predation risk from reintroduced predators, lions, Panthera leo. The risk categories each represented a different predation risk component and included metrics that defined the component at multiple scales. Intense vigilance responses were scale dependent, with zebra responding to a risky place at the landscape level and wildebeest to vegetation characteristics at a foraging area scale. Yet both species were able to adjust and balance time spent on vigilance types. Prey characteristics reduced the intense vigilance of wildebeest as herd size increased. Both species maintained similar levels of intense vigilance between seasons, despite lower resource availability, and thus higher foraging costs, in the dry season. However, the reduction in grass quality probably resulted in the increase in routine vigilance by both species during the dry season, as more time was needed to chew grasses with high fibre content. Our findings suggest different underlying mechanisms for the two types of vigilance behaviour, which were influenced by the ecology of the species, and demonstrate the importance of distinguishing vigilance types in predation risk studies.

We discuss the existence and local stability of equilibria by making full use of qualitative analytical theory. It is shown that the above system exhibits at most two positive equilibria and it can undergo a series of bifurcation phenomena. We indicate that the dynamical behavior of the model is closely related to the fear effect on predator. In detail, when the fear effect parameter p = p*, the system will undergo degenerate Hopf bifurcation. There exist two limit cycles (the inner is stable and the outer is unstable). However, when p = p(*), the system will undergo degenerate Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation. Also, by numerical simulation, we conclude that the stronger the fear effect, the bigger the density of prey species. The above shows that fear effect on predator is beneficial to the persistence of the prey species.

We observe oscillatory behavior of the system in the absence of fear, migration and switching, whereas the system shows stable dynamics if anyone of these three factors is introduced. After analyzing the behavior of system with fear, migration and switching, we find that the system does not possess periodic solution whenever the predator population experiences intraspecies competition, but in the absence of intraspecies competition among predator population, fear of predators destabilizes the system, whereas on increasing the migration rates, the system first undergoes subcritical Hopf-bifurcation and then supercritical Hopf-bifurcation settling the system to stable coexistence. Existence of multiple limit cycles is also observed. Our results show that switching behavior of predator population supports the survival of prey and predator populations. We extend our model by assuming the fear parameters as time dependent. We find that the nonautonomous system exhibits periodic solutions, whereas the corresponding autonomous system shows stable focus. Moreover, we observe that if the autonomous system undergoes a Hopf-bifurcation through limit cycle oscillations, the corresponding nonautonomous system shows higher periodic solutions. Almost periodic behavior of the system is also observed by setting the fear parameters as almost periodic functions of time.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  2     Total Times Cited:  2     Cited Reference Count:  53 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Included""}",10.1007/s11071-021-06210-y     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Predator-prey model;Fear effect;Switching;Periodic solution;Global attractivity;Almost periodic solution;Prednisolone,,

Some experimental studies confirmed that fear affects the reproduction rate of the prey population, but a few studies are there, which conclude that fear also affects the death rate of the prey population. Thus our main aim in this work is to investigate the influence of the fear effect produced by a predator on the reproduction rate and death rate of the prey population.

Through model analysis, it has been observed that fear factor regulates the dynamics of the system in a completely different way than in the case where functional response is only prey dependent. Also, intra-specific competition among predators reduces the effect of fear and it forms a different pattern in the system dynamics than that of the effect of fear. Furthermore, the deterministic model has been extended to a stochastic model by perturbing the natural death rates of both prey and predators. It has been observed that the stochastic system possesses a unique positive solution that is globally stable with respect to anywhere in the interior of the positive quadrant. The stochastic extinction and persistence scenario for both the species have been analysed and a detailed comparison between the deterministic and stochastic models have been done through exhaustive numerical simulation.

Due to the duality of the interaction between prey and predator, we used a game theory approach to investigate whether DVM can be a suitable strategy for the predator as well as the prey.

Fight duration and number of repetitions of a behavioral element correlate moderately to relative fighting ability. Variation in real contests depends on differences between the contestants in the ability to incur cost and the value of the contested resource. I hypothesized that an additional source of variation is differences between individuals in their perception of how dangerous it is to fight. To investigate this, I used the risk of predation to study the effect on the use of different agonistic behaviors in fights between males of the cichlid fish Nannacara anomala. In the group subjected to predation risk, the rime until the most escalated behavior (mouth wrestling) was more variable and increased significantly on average. In addition, the duration of fights was significantly longer In the predator treatment the use of visual assessment and tail beating varied more than in the control, giving a significant positive relationship between the use of low-intensity behaviors and time to mouth wrestling across the group. These relationships were less pronounced in the control group.

However, little theory has considered the case where predators and prey respond to one another simultaneously. I present a framework that examines the impact of the predator-prey behavioural interactions (within and between species) in a state-dependent life-history context. I use multiple linked dynamic state variable game equations to predict the patch selection of prey and predators as a function of their energy reserves. When prey are expected to maximize their probability of survival, the individual predators and prey that are not at risk of starvation are predicted to be uniformly distributed among patches independent of the difference in resource input rates among sites. However, individuals near starvation cause more prey and predators to be found in high resource sites. In contrast, when predators and prey both maximize reproduction, predators and prey are predicted to show imperfect resource matching. The proportion of individuals at risk of starvation causes deviations from the perfect resource matching predicted by previous predator-prey games. The predicted patterns clearly illustrate the importance of recognizing that predators and prey will both respond concurrently to one another's distributions. However, the models also illustrate that an organism's state, competition among conspecifics and the life-history pattern of both predators and prey are key to understanding their distribution and behaviour. We can increase our understanding of these interactions and the distribution of predators and prey in space and time by combining the consideration of interactions within and between the species with knowledge of how foraging relates to lifetime expected reproductive success of both predators and prey.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  57     Total Times Cited:  57     Cited Reference Count:  80 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Included""}",,dynamic state variable model;game theory;habitat selection;life history;predator-prey interactions;IDEAL FREE DISTRIBUTION;EVOLUTIONARILY STABLE STRATEGIES;DIEL VERTICAL MIGRATION;INDIVIDUAL-BASED MODELS;POPULATION-DYNAMICS;ENGRAULIS-MORDAX;NORTHERN ANCHOVY;MATING-BEHAVIOR;RISK;HISTORY;Prednisolone,,

In this article, the fear of predator in prey species has been introduced. Also, we have considered that the predation of both prey and predator occurs according to the BeddingtonDeAngelis type functional response. The predator is thought to be acting as a shelter for the super predator species. It is anticipated that a constant amount of increased food will be delivered to super predators due to their dread of predators and their refuge behavior, and that predators will benefit from this excess food. The non negativity and boundedness of solutions of the prosed model have been examined. The system's local and global stability at the interior equilibrium points has been explored. The existence condition of Hopf bifurcation of the system with respect to fear f of predator has been studied. From the analysis of the model, it is found that the fear f of predator may be responsible for the system's stability. It's also been discovered that providing extra food to the super predator may help to keep the system in check. Further, it is found that the refuge of predator to the super predator has the ability to stabilize the predator-prey system.

In the model, high levels of flightiness limit the risk of being killed by predators, but increase the amount of energy lost in flights during the season. The predicted levels of fearfulness are extremely variable. They depend on the respective frequencies of predatory attacks and simple disturbing events, and on the capacity of birds to detect and escape predators.

Then, some properties of nonconstant positive steady states are investigated, such as nonexistence, existence, and steady state bifurcation. Applying the fixed point index theory, the existence of the nonconstant positive steady state is discussed, indicating that the proper diffusion rate of prey and larger diffusion rate of predator are beneficial to survival of populations. Moreover, taking the diffusion rate of predator as the bifurcation parameter, the steady state bifurcations from simple and double eigenvalues are intensively established. At last, the validity of the theoretical analysis is verified by numerical simulations.

On territorial behavior and other factors influencing habitat distribution in birds. Acta Biotheoretica 19, 16-32] to predict how a single species will distribute itself among several patches, is often cited as an example of an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS). By defining the strategies and payoffs for habitat selection, this article puts the IFD concept in a more general game-theoretic setting of the ""habitat selection game"". Within this game-theoretic framework, the article focuses on recent progress in the following directions: (1) studying evolutionarily stable dispersal rates and corresponding dispersal dynamics; (2) extending the concept when population numbers are not fixed but undergo population dynamics; (3) generalizing the IFD to multiple species.        For a single species, the article briefly reviews existing results. It also develops a new perspective for Parker's matching principle, showing that this can be viewed as the IFD of the habitat selection game that models consumer behavior in several resource patches and analyzing complications involved when the model includes resource dynamics as well. For two species, the article first demonstrates that the connection between IFD and ESS is now more delicate by pointing out pitfalls that arise when applying several existing game-theoretic approaches to these habitat selection games. However, by providing a new detailed analysis of dispersal dynamics for predator-prey or competitive interactions in two habitats, it also pinpoints one approach that shows much promise in this general setting, the so-called ""two-species ESS"". The consequences of this concept are shown to be related to recent studies of population dynamics combined with individual dispersal and are explored for more species or more patches.

However, these models generally assume that animals choose their action before observing the behaviour of their opponents while, in many natural situations, individuals in fact continuously react to the actions of others. A negotiation process then takes place and this may fundamentally influence the individual attitudes and the tendency to cooperate. Here, I use the classical model system of vigilance behaviour to demonstrate the consequences of such behavioural negotiation among selfish individuals, by predicting patterns of vigilance in a pair of animals foraging under threat of predation. I show that the game played by the animals and the resulting vigilance strategies take radically different forms, according to the way predation risk is shared in the pair. In particular, if predators choose their target at random, the prey respond by displaying moderate vigilance and taking turns scanning. By contrast, if the individual that takes flight later in an attack endures a higher risk of being targeted, vigilance increases and there is always at least one sentinel in the pair. Finally, when lagging behind its companion in fleeing from an attacker becomes extremely risky, vigilance decreases again and the animals scan simultaneously.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  2     Total Times Cited:  2     Cited Reference Count:  39 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1098/rspb.2012.0097     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),antipredator behaviour;cooperation;evolutionarily stable strategies;game theory;negotiation;vigilance;GROUP-SIZE;ANTIPREDATORY VIGILANCE;PREDATORS;COORDINATION;STABILITY;EVOLUTION;BEHAVIOR;BASICS;ATTACK;BIRDS,,

However, little is known either theoretically or empirically about behavioral mechanisms that underlie the spatial patterns that emerge when predators and prey freely interact. We examined the joint space use and behavioral rules governing movement of freely interacting groups of odonate (dragonfly) predators and two size classes of anuran (tadpole) prey in arenas containing two patches with different levels of the prey's resource. Predator and prey movement and space use was quantified both when they were apart and together. When apart from predators, large tadpoles strongly preferred the high resource patch. When apart from prey, dragonflies weakly preferred the high resource patch. When together, large prey shifted to a uniform distribution, while predators strongly preferred the high resource patch. These patterns qualitatively fit the predictions of several three trophic level, ideal free distribution models. In contrast, the space use of small prey and predators did not deviate from uniform. Three measures of joint space use ( spatial correlations, overlap, and co-occurrence) concurred in suggesting that prey avoidance of predators was more important than predator attraction to prey in determining overall spatial patterns. To gain additional insight into behavioral mechanisms, we used a model selection approach to identify behavioral movement rules that can potentially explain the observed, emergent patterns of space use. Prey were more likely to leave patches with more predators and more conspecific competitors; resources had relatively weak effects on prey movements. In contrast, predators were more likely to leave patches with low resources (that they do not consume) and more competing predators; prey had relatively little effect on predator movements. These results highlight the importance of investigating freely interacting predators and prey, the potential for simple game theory models to predict joint spatial distributions, and the utility of using model choice methods to identify potential key factors that govern movement.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  86     Total Times Cited:  89     Cited Reference Count:  41 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Maybe""}",10.1890/06-1236     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),amphibian larvae;antipredator behavior;behavioral response race;game theory;ideal free distributions;invertebrate predators;model selection;patch use;predator;predator-prey foraging games;prey;HABITAT SELECTION GAMES;IDEAL FREE DISTRIBUTION;FORAGING GAMES;DENSITY-DEPENDENCE;PATCH CHOICE;DYNAMICS;RISK;CONSEQUENCES;AGGREGATION;GERBILS;Prednisolone,,

The expansion and sophistication of 'microtransaction' options in online games (e.g., 'loot boxes') has also led to concerns about vulnerable users (e.g., adolescents) overspending on these schemes. Currently, there are limited regulatory and/or consumer protection frameworks for video game monetization schemes. This conceptual paper explores some potential social responsibility measures for monetized gaming products to stimulate further discussion and developments in this area. Loot boxes are a focus of this discussion given the current debate on their legality, i.e., similarity to electronic gambling machines. Drawing on social responsibility principles and research in the field of gambling studies, we outline some potential measures in the areas of: (1) game design and in-game purchasing system characteristics, (2) transparency and accuracy of game design and features, (3) broad consumer protection measures, and (4) consumer information and industry accountability.

The birth rate of the prey population has been reduced due to the fear of predation, i.e., a fear effect is considered in the prey population. Moreover, a fraction of the prey is available to the consumer for consumption and this has been done by incorporation of prey refuge term. The predation between consumer and predator follows Beddington-DeAngelis response. Boundedness and positivity of the system prove that the proposed model is well-posed. Also, there are some parametric restrictions under which the system is permanent. Routh-Hurwitz criterion shows the local stability conditions of the equilibrium points and on the other hand Lyapunov LaSalle theorem guarantees that the locally stable equilibrium points are globally stable. Also, Matlab validates the analytical results with the help of diagrams. The occurrence of transcritical bifurcations have been shown and conditions for the existence of a limit cycle in the system through Hopf bifurcation also have been stated. Both the analytical and numerical results suggest that a certain amount of fear can make the system steady. It is also noted that the prey refuge has both stabilizing and destabilizing effect on the system.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  1     Total Times Cited:  1     Cited Reference Count:  54 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Included""}",10.2298/FIL2115971S     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Fear effect;Holling type-III functional response;Beddington-DeAngelis functional response;Bifurcations;Persistence;PREDATION RISK;REPRODUCTION;PERSISTENCE;BEHAVIOR;ECOLOGY;WOLVES;WEB,,

We ask, do different predator species affect each other's patch selection? If the predators facilitate each other, they should prefer to hunt in the same patch; if they interfere, they should prefer to hunt alone. We performed an experiment in a large outdoor vivarium where we presented barn owls (Tyto alba) with a choice of hunting greater Egyptian gerbils (Gerbillus pyramidum) in patches with or without Saharan horned vipers (Cerastes cerastes). Gerbils foraged on feeding trays set under bushes or in the open. We monitored owl location, activity, and hunting attempts, viper activity and ambush site location, and the foraging behavior of the gerbils in bush and open microhabitats. Owls directed more attacks towards patches with vipers, and vipers were more active in the presence of owls. Owls and vipers facilitated each other's hunting through their combined effect on gerbil behavior, especially on full moon nights when vipers are more active. Owls forced gerbils into the bushes where vipers preferred to ambush, while viper presence chased gerbils into the open where they were exposed to owls. Owls and vipers took advantage of their indirect positive effect on each other. In the foraging game context, they improve each other's patch quality and hunting success.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  35     Total Times Cited:  36     Cited Reference Count:  36 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s00442-013-2760-2     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Optimal foraging;Predator interactions;Risk management;Behavioral tools;Community ecology;FORAGING BEHAVIOR;PATCH USE;TIME ALLOCATION;PREY;GERBILS;RISK;RATES;VIGILANCE;SNAKES;COMPETITION;Prednisolone,,

Ecol.,6,3,198-222,"MESTERTONGIBBONS, M",,English,,,"This paper develops a mathematical model of an iterated, asymmetric Hawk-Dove game with the novel feature that not only are successive pairs of interactants-in the roles of owner and intruder contesting a site - drawn randomly from the population, but also the behaviour adopted at one interaction affects the role of a contestant in the next.  Under the assumption that a site is essential for reproduction, the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) of the population is found to depend on the probability, w, that the game will continue for at least a further period (which is inversely related to predation risk), and five other parameters; two of them are measures of site scarcity, two are measures of fighting costs, and the last is a measure of resource holding potential (RHP).  Among the four strategies - Hawk (H), Dove (D), Bourgeois (B) and anti-Bourgeois (X) - only D is incapable of being an ESS; and regions of parameter space are found in which the ESS can be only H, or only X, or only B; or either H or X; or either X or B; or either H or B; or any of the three.  The scarcer the sites or the lower the costs of fighting, or the lower the value of w, the more likely it is that H is an ESS; the more abundant the sites or the higher the costs of fighting, or the higher the value of w, the more likely it is that X or B is an ESS.  The different ESSs are interpreted as different ecotypes.  The analysis suggests how a non-fighting population could evolve from a fighting population under decreasing risk of predation.  If there were no RHP, or if RHP were low, then the ESS in the non-fighting population would be X; only if RHP were sufficiently high would the ESS be B, and the scarcer the sites, the higher the RHP would have to be.  These conclusions support the thesis that if long-term territories are essential for reproduction and sites are scarce, then ownership is ruled out not only as an uncorrelated asymmetry for settling disputes in favour of owner, but also as a correlated asymmetry.

But some resources are prey - sentient animals likely capable of responding to the predation challenge posed by their predator/forager. Such a combination of species constitutes an adaptive foraging game. We have been studying one between goldfish (the prey) and little egrets (the forager) in an experimental theatre that allows us to control and alter the environmental variables that should matter to both species.        Species: Common goldfish (Carassius auratus), a carp, and the little egret (Egretta garzetta), a heron.        Question: In what ways do egrets and goldfish adjust to a difference in goldfish abundance? Do such adjustments conform to foraging theory?        Experimental theatres: Two aviaries, each containing three pools for fish. Each pool had two habitats, one in which fish were safe from the egret but had no food, the other risky but with food.        Methods: There were two treatments: 15 fish per pool and 25 fish per pool, each with one egret allowed to forage freely among the pools. Control treatments had no egret. Digital cameras recorded fish and egret behaviour continuously during 6-hour experimental days. Each 6-hour period began with either 45 or 75 fish (i.e. 15 or 25 fish in each pool). During each experimental minute we recorded the egret's location, the number of fish alive in each pool, how many fish in each pool were outside the safer habitat, and all fish captures. We also measured the mean foraging time of an egret in a pool throughout an experimental day and how long it took an egret to return to a specific pool after leaving it (return time). Finally, we determined the amount of leftover fish food after each day.        Results: Fish and egrets adjusted their behaviours to variation in fish density. And the adjustments make sense as anti-predatory or as foraging improvement tactics. Fish faced with high risk of predation greatly reduced their exposure to the riskier habitat, and did so even more in the extremely risky 15-fish pools compared with the 25-fish pools. They did so although they suffered lower per-capita food consumption in proportion to their avoidance of the riskier habitat. The egrets responded to the greater fish density by foraging longer in a pool: 35% longer in the 25-fish pools than in the 15-fish pools. Thus the egrets behaved opposite to the prediction of the marginal value theorem. However, in so doing, egrets did optimize the rate at which they captured fish.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  7     Total Times Cited:  7     Cited Reference Count:  31 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",,predator-prey foraging game;prey density;anti-predatory behaviour;marginal value theorem;optimal foraging;GROUP-SIZE;RISK;APPREHENSION;INFORMATION;SELECTION;BEHAVIOR;GERBILS;ECOLOGY;TIME;FISH;Prednisolone,,

The feasibility conditions of all equilibrium points and their stability behaviours are derived. Next, we have studied the existence of local bifurcation (transcritical bifurcation) of codimension 1. Moreover, impacts of fear effect have been studied analytically and noticed that the predator biomass can not only be decreased at the interior equilibrium by the effect of fear but the system also be stabilized by excluding the existence of periodic solutions through Hopf-bifurcation. In addition, uniform persistence of our proposed system has been discussed analytically. Further, we have analysed the stability behaviours of the interior equilibrium for all combinations of the delay factors (tau and tau ') and observed that the delay parameters may produce oscillating behaviours through a Hopf-bifurcation. Numerical simulations have been illustrated using MATLAB to validate all the analytical results.

The joining decision has been modeled as a producer-scrounger game where the producer strategy consists of searching for one's food and the scrounger strategy consists of searching for food discovered by others. Previous models revealed that the evolutionarily stable proportion of scrounging mostly depends on the fraction of each food patch available only to its producer. These early models are static and state independent and are therefore unable to explore whether the time of day, the animal's state, and the degree of predation hazard influence an individual's decision of whether to use the producer or scrounger strategy. To investigate these issues, we developed a state-dependent dynamic producer-scrounger game model. The model predicts that, early in the day, low reserves promote a preference for the scrounger strategy, while the same condition late in the day favors the use of the producer strategy. Under rich and clumped food, the availability of scrounging can improve the daily survival of any average group member. The model suggests only weak effects of predation hazard on the use of scrounging. Future developments should consider the effects of dominance asymmetries and allowing foragers a choice between foraging alone or in a group harboring an evolutionarily stable Frequency of scrounger.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  43     Total Times Cited:  43     Cited Reference Count:  49 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1086/303342     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),social foraging;producer-scrounger game;state-dependent dynamic game;FORAGING SUCCESS;CAPTIVE FLOCKS;JUNCO-HYEMALIS;DAILY ROUTINES;GROUP-SIZE;BEHAVIOR;RISK;DOMINANCE;ENVIRONMENT;STRATEGIES;Prednisolone,,

For example, mesopredators may ""directly"" perceive risk by visually observing apex predators, or may ""indirectly"" perceive risk by observing habitats used by predators. Direct assessments should more accurately characterize the arrangement of risk and reward; however, indirect assessments are used more frequently in studies concerning the response of GPS-marked animals to spatiotemporally variable sources of risk and reward. We investigated the response of a mesopredator to the presence of risk and reward created by an apex predator, where risk and reward likely vary in relative perceptibility (i.e., degree of being perceptible). First, we tested whether coyotes (Canis latrans) use direct or indirect assessments to navigate the presence of mountain lions (Puma concolor; risk) and kills made by mountain lions (reward) in an area where coyotes were a common prey item for mountain lions. Second, we assessed the behavioral response of coyotes to direct encounters with mountain lions. Third, we evaluated spatiotemporal use of carrion by coyotes at kills made by mountain lions. Indirect assessments generally outperformed direct assessments when integrating analyses into a unified framework; nevertheless, our ability to detect direct perception in navigating to mountain lion kills was likely restricted by scale and sampling limitations (e.g., collar fix rates, unsampled kill sites). Rather than responding to the risk of direct encounters with mountain lions, coyotes facilitated encounters by increasing their movement rate, and engaged in risky behavior by scavenging at mountain lion kills. Coyotes appear to mitigate risk by using indirect perception to avoid mountain lions. Our predator-predator interactions and insights are nuanced and counter to the conventional predator-prey systems that have generated much of the predation risk literature.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  94 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1002/ece3.8641     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),coyote;encounter rate;intraguild predation;mountain lion;predation risk;scavenge;RESOURCE SELECTION FUNCTIONS;MOUNTAIN LIONS;ANTIPREDATOR BEHAVIOR;ANIMAL MOVEMENT;PREY;PATTERNS;WOLVES;SPACE;RATES;FACILITATION;Dogs;Cats;Prednisolone;Reward,,

We consider a signal that is difficult for prey to fake, such as approaching the predator, and assume that the signal also alerts other prey in the patch, thereby reducing the overall value of that patch to the predator. We analyse the model using evolutionary game theory and adaptive dynamics on prey and predator fitness-generating functions to determine convergent stable equilibrium solutions for the behaviour of prey and predator. We consider the effects on equilibria of the probability of predator detection, signalling cost, predator travel time and the chance of killing the prey. Depending on the parameter values, we find stable equilibria at pure signalling, nonsignalling and mixed evolutionarily stable strategies (ESSs). For example, prey are more likely to signal when they have a low probability of detecting the predator, and when the predator's missed opportunity costs are higher. We also find that there are two basins of attraction such that the system evolves towards one of them depending on the initial strategy values. This is the first two-prey pursuit-deterrent signalling game we are aware of, providing a novel theoretical basis for the evolution of signalling in group-living prey.

Most research on responses to predation risk has come from studies on herbivore prey, whereas little research has focused on mesopredator behavioural responses to risk. We studied antipredator behaviours of mesopredator cheetahs, Acinonyx jubatus, exposed to top predator risk from lions, Panthera leo, and leopards, Panthera pardus, by using a playback experiment to manipulate short-term predation risk in areas of differing long-term risk. We did not find support for the risky places hypothesis; cheetah vigilance was not influenced by longterm risk. On the contrary, we found support for the risky times hypothesis; cheetahs were more vigilant and more likely to flee following lion and leopard playbacks. Additionally, we did not find support for the risky times and risky places hypothesis or the predation risk allocation hypothesis; cheetah antipredator behaviours following a predator playback were not associated with long-term predation risk. Finally, cheetahs had higher baseline vigilance in areas of open vegetation but were more likely to flee from lion sounds in areas of dense vegetation and from leopards in areas of open vegetation.

We predicted that individuals with familiar members in their group would have a higher survival, acquire resources faster, avoid predators more easily and perform more cooperative actions. We used data from an online video game (Dead by Daylight) where small groups of four players (i.e. prey) must exploit resource patches while avoiding a predator. Prey can help fellow prey when the predator catches them (cooperation). Using a video game as a study system provided access to a large behavioural data set that would otherwise be difficult to obtain in nature. Using path analysis, we found evidence that coordinated resource acquisition and helping behaviours increased with the number of familiar individuals in the group. However, more cooperative actions increased their encounters with the predator and thus reduced their survival. When accounting for all indirect effects of familiarity on survival (through resource acquisition, cooperation and predator -prey encounters), familiarity had a small indirect net positive effect on survival.

The goal of this work is to analyze the dynamic nature of the system when the constant search rate in the Holling type II response is replaced by a prey-dependent search rate in the presence of fear effect which raises the anti-predator behaviour of prey. Some basic properties such as positivity, uniform boundedness, and persistence have been provided. Next, we have studied the existing conditions and stability criteria of all equilibria. Then, the conditions for the occurrence of local bifurcations of co-dimension 1 are given. Furthermore, we have investigated the effects of all the combinations of delay factors (breeding and gestation delay) for which the proposed system switches its stability through supercritical Hopf bifurcation. Numerical simulations are conducted to validate analytical results. It is observed that level of fear can not only reduce predator's growth at the interior equilibrium but also stabilize the system by excluding the existence of a limit cycle. We also discuss the similarities and differences between our proposed system and the usual Holling type II model. Lastly, the deterministic system has been extended to a stochastic model using nonlinear perturbation.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  10     Total Times Cited:  10     Cited Reference Count:  43 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Included""}",10.1007/s11071-021-06435-x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Prey-dependent search rate;Fear effect;Local bifurcations;Time delays;Nonlinear perturbation;Gaussian white noise;ADDITIONAL FOOD;MODEL;STABILITY;Prednisolone,,

Mating between quality groups results from two-dimensional random encounter and mutual assent, where assent reflects an attempt to maximize expected lifetime reproductive success, E(LRS). Premating predation (via random encounter with predators) and other mortality also influence E(LRS). Given potentially conflicting optimal choices, the model finds the evolutionarily stable patterns of choosiness for the four quality groups. When there are multiple mating episodes by individuals through the season, the resulting dynamic game is solved to obtain a seasonal pattern of mate choice and reproduction. The model generates seven different mating patterns among quality groups. These patterns imply different opportunities for selection, as indicated by the variance components of normalized lifetime reproductive success, var(LRS). The changes in E(LRS), var(LRS), and mating patterns in response to different densities of predators and of potential mates are explored in detail. Decreasing predation risk or increasing mate availability tends to increase E(LRS), choosiness, and assortative mating. Var(LRS) and thus the opportunity for selection for mate quality is highest at intermediate densities of predators and of potential mates. When density remains constant throughout the mating season, choosiness increases late in the season, a time at which less of the potential E(LRS) is jeopardized by the greater predation risk associated with choosiness. Reproductive success of the low-quality group of the less choosy sex is particularly sensitive to changes in density and other parameters. When seasonal density patterns of predators and potential mates are predictable, these low-quality individuals should do better and may thus be more numerous when mate densities are high and predator densities are low, or when predator densities are high and mate densities are low, than for other combinations of relative densities.

Trade-offs of this kind are involved in many types of behavior, including foraging under risk of predation, parental care, size versus number of offspring, and so on. We treat the combined effects of demographic and environmental Variance, demographic variance being important for small populations and environmental variance being important at all population levels. With high environmental variance, population numbers fluctuate sharply, so that demographic variance becomes intermittently important. As a consequence, either behavioral morph may become fixed in the population, depending on initial conditions and on chance events. We treat both phenotypic and genetic models.

The optimal balance of risk and reward should depend on the individual's state, particularly hunger status. Satiated individuals are hypothesized to react more strongly to risk than hungry individuals, for which the necessity for food overrides perceived danger. We tested this in wood frog (Lithobates sylvaticus) tadpoles by comparing the response of fasted and fed tadpoles to injured conspecifics (alarm cue) and uninjured conspecifics (control). Food restriction significantly affected the activity levels of tadpoles and the impact of injured conspecific cues on activity. Fed tadpoles responded little to these cues, tending to decrease activity. Hungry tadpoles were more active overall and responded to injured conspecific cues by increasing activity. We propose that hungry tadpoles increase their activity in response to an injured conspecific because, in addition to indicating danger, this cue represents a nutrient source for this opportunistically cannibalistic species, and hungry tadpoles should thus adopt risky behavior to acquire this valuable resource. Differences in hunger may therefore explain variation among studies of tadpole responses to injured conspecifics. Future studies in aquatic organisms should consider the role of hunger status when assessing antipredator behavior.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  14     Total Times Cited:  15     Cited Reference Count:  64 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s10750-014-2048-5     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Alarm cues;Antipredator behavior;Cannibalism;Hunger;Predation risk;State-dependent behavior;RISK-TAKING BEHAVIOR;CHEMICAL ALARM CUES;PREDATOR-AVOIDANCE;WOOD FROG;GASTEROSTEUS-ACULEATUS;DEPENDENT BEHAVIOR;FORAGING BEHAVIOR;RANA-SYLVATICA;TOAD TADPOLES;GROWTH;Food,,

We present here an experiment that tests the way the same indirect cues of predation risk are interpreted by bank voles, Myodes glareolus, as the game changes through exposure to a caged weasel. Using optimal patch use, we asked wild-caught voles to rank the risk they perceived. We measured their response to olfactory cues in the form of weasel bedding, a sham control in the form of rabbit bedding, and an odor-free control. We repeated the interviews in a chronological order to test the change in response, i.e., the changes in the value of the information. We found that the voles did not differentiate strongly between treatments pre-exposure to the weasel. During the exposure, vole foraging activity was reduced in all treatments, but proportionally increased in the vicinity to the rabbit odor. Post-exposure, the voles focused their foraging in the control, while the value of exposure to the predator explained the majority of variation in response. Our data also suggested a sex bias in interpretation of the cues. Given how the foragers changed their interpretation of the same cues based on external information, we suggest that applying predator olfactory cues as a simulation of predation risk needs further testing. For instance, what are the possible effective compounds and how they change fear response over time. The major conclusion is that however effective olfactory cues may be, the presence of live predators overwhelmingly affects the information voles gained from these cues.Significance statementIn ecology, fear is the strategic response to cues of risk an animal senses in its environment. The cues suggesting the existence of a predator in the vicinity are weighed by an individual against the probability of encounter with the predator and the perceived lethality of an encounter with the predator. The best documented such response is variation in foraging tenacity as measured by a giving-up density. In this paper, we show that an olfactory predator cue and the smell of an interspecific competitor result in different responses based on experience with a live-caged predator. This work provides a cautionary example of the risk in making assumptions regarding olfactory cues devoid of environmental context.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  10     Total Times Cited:  10     Cited Reference Count:  78 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s00265-018-2600-9     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Predator-prey interactions;Giving-up density;Perceived risk;Evolutionary game theory;Y-maze;LONG-DISTANCE MOVEMENTS;FEMALE BANK VOLES;PATCH USE;BREEDING SUPPRESSION;ANTIPREDATORY RESPONSE;SMALL MUSTELIDS;RISK;BEHAVIOR;PREY;WEASELS;Cues;Prednisolone,,

Unlike conditioned fear, the neuronal circuitry underlying innate fear is largely unknown. We found that the laterodorsal tegmentum (LDT) and lateral habenula (LHb) are specifically activated by the mouse predator odorant trimethylthiazoline (TMT). Using optogenetics to selectively stimulate GABAergic neurons in the LDT immediately produced fear-like responses (freezing, accelerated heart rate and increased serum corticosterone), whereas prolonged stimulation caused anxiety-like behaviors. Notably, although selective stimulation of parvalbumin (PV)-positive interneurons similarly induced fear-like responses, stimulation of somatostatin-positive interneurons or inhibition of PV neurons in the LDT suppressed TMT-induced fear-like responses without affecting conditioned fear. Finally, activation of LHb glutamatergic inputs to LDT interneurons was sufficient to generate fear-like responses. Thus, the LHb-LDT pathway is important for regulating olfactory cue-induced innate fear. Our results provide a potential target for therapeutic intervention for anxiety disorder.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  57     Total Times Cited:  59     Cited Reference Count:  49 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1038/nn.4208     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),PREDATOR ODOR;VENTROMEDIAL HYPOTHALAMUS;UNCONDITIONED FEAR;LATERAL HABENULA;FOX FECES;NEURONS;ANXIETY;AMYGDALA;RAT;DEPRESSION;Interneurons;Cues,,

We studied the behavioral game between predators and prey within the framework of social foraging among predators. We tested how conspecific interactions among predators (little egret) change the predator-prey behavioral game and foraging success. To do so, we examined foraging behavior of egrets alone and in pairs (male and female) in a specially designed aviary consisting of three equally spaced pools with identical initial prey (comet goldfish) densities. Each pool was comprised of a risky microhabitat, rich with food, and a safe microhabitat with no food, forcing the fish to trade off food and safety. When faced with two versus one egret, we found that fish significantly reduced activity in the risky habitat. Egrets in pairs suffered reduced foraging success (negative intraspecific density dependence) and responded to fish behavior and to their conspecific by changing their visiting regime at the different pools-having shorter, more frequent visits. The time egret spent on each visit allowed them to match their long-term capture success rate across the environment to their capture success rate in the pool, which satisfies one aspect of optimality. Overall, egrets in pairs allocated more time for foraging and changed their foraging tactics to focus more on fish under cover and fish 'peeping' out from their shelter. These results suggest that both prey and predator show behavioral flexibility and can adjust to changing conditions as needed in this foraging game.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  8     Total Times Cited:  8     Cited Reference Count:  55 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s00442-017-3884-6     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Predator-prey interactions;Foraging behavior;Conspecific interactions;Time allocation;Predator density;GOLDFISH CARASSIUS-AURATUS;EGRETS EGRETTA-GARZETTA;FORAGING GAME;WAITING GAME;GROUP-SIZE;RISK;INTERFERENCE;COMPETITION;DENSITY;SUCCESS;Prednisolone,,

In the model, both prey and predator may choose between either a simple or a complex habitat. A second predator is restricted to hunting only in the simple habitat. The model is applied to a system of rodents and their predators: snakes (the generalist predator) and owls. The simplest version of the model predicts that snakes and rodents distribute themselves among the two microhabitats according to the relative magnitude of risk for rodents. Under various conditions (moonlight, competition among rodents and dilution of the risk) the model predicts that snakes distribute themselves among habitats in a way that dampens rodent reactions to variation in owl predation risk and to effects of competition. When rodents are abundant the model predicts that snakes will show a weaker reaction to moonlight. The predictions of the model are qualitatively comparable to field data of microhabitat use of kangaroo rats and sidewinders from the Mojave Desert. The model can also describe a habitat selection game at a larger scale (e.g., movements of snakes into a rich desert oasis). Although a game between predators and prey may not be the cause for all their movements among habitats in the field, a game perspective may contribute explanations for what would otherwise be unintuitive habitat shifts.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  41     Total Times Cited:  43     Cited Reference Count:  64 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Included""}",,PREDATION RISK;FORAGING BEHAVIOR;PREY INTERACTIONS;KANGAROO RATS;DESERT RODENT;FISH;OWLS;MICROHABITAT;MOONLIGHT;EVOLUTION;Prednisolone;Rodentia,,

In the complete-market setting, each agent's set of strategic choices consists of the security payoffs and the pricing kernel that are consistent with the optimal-sharing rules; while in the incomplete setting, agents respond via demand functions on a vector of given tradeable securities. It is shown that at the (Nash) risk-sharing equilibrium, the sharing securities are suboptimal, since agents submit for sharing different risk exposures than their true endowments. On the other hand, the Nash equilibrium prices stay unaffected by the game only in the special case of agents with the same risk aversion.

For the falcons, attacking vulnerable sandpipers roosting on the shore too early would discourage roosting, but waiting too long might be problematic as well since the roost could disband. Sandpipers are expected to be responsive against potential attacks, but being responsive too long comes at the cost of curtailing rest. The evolutionary stable solution in this game suggests that falcons should attack at all possible times, but concentrate their attacks in the early phases of roosting. Responsiveness by sandpipers, which I measured using the rate of false alarms during roosting, should decrease with time spent roosting.

Ecological traps in reintroductions can be identified only through intensive studies of habitat preferences and survival of known individuals, but such studies are lacking. 2. We investigated habitat preferences and their relationship with survival by radio-tracking reintroduced, captive-bred grey partridges Perdix perdix, a widely reintroduced commercial game species and native farmland bird of conservation concern in the UK. The low success rate of grey partridge releases could be due to maladaptive habitat use and a possible ecological trap. 3. Grey partridges released as pairs in spring showed preferences for crop and field margin habitat. The use of crops had a positive, and use of field margins a negative, association with survival, suggesting field margins could serve as ecological traps for released grey partridges. Predation rates were high, and field margins probably hosted concentrated predator activity. 4. Grey partridges released as family groups (coveys) in autumn exhibited a preference for game covers, i.e. areas of tall vegetation specifically planted to provide cover for game birds, and mortality rates were lower than in spring. Habitat use did not affect survival in autumn. 5. Synthesis and applications. We have shown that newly released grey partridge pairs behave maladaptively by preferring a habitat which has a negative association with survival. In grey partridge reintroductions, we recommend releasing grey partridge family groups in autumn rather than releasing pairs of birds in spring, and providing game covers that could induce the groups to settle onto the release areas. In reintroductions in general, the habitat preferences of the released animals should be documented together with their fates, to enable detection of possible ecological traps that could threaten the success of these conservation efforts.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  35     Total Times Cited:  36     Cited Reference Count:  44 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/j.1365-2664.2010.01867.x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),compositional analysis;conservation;field margin;game bird;game cover;habitat choice;habitat use;predation risk;re-introduction;release;PERDIX-PERDIX;PREDATION MORTALITY;CONSERVATION;SELECTION;CONSEQUENCES;EXPERIENCE;LANDSCAPE;SUCCESS;BIOLOGY;EDGE;Ecosystem,,

These behaviors included landscape-scale movements by predators and prey, a type of prey vigilance that increases immediately after an encounter and then decays over time ('ratcheting vigilance'), and predator management of prey vigilance. I analyzed the game using a computer-based evolutionary algorithm. This algorithm embedded an individual-based model of ecological interactions within a dynamic adaptive process of mutation and selection. I investigated how evolutionarily stable strategies (ESS) varied with the predators' learning ability, killing efficiency, density and rate of movement. I found that when predators learn prey location, random prey movement can be an ESS. Increased predator killing efficiency reduced prey movement, but only if the rate of predator movement was low. Predators countered ratcheting vigilance by delaying their follow-up attacks; however, this delay was reduced in the presence of additional predators. The interdependence of pre-and post-encounter behaviors revealed by the evolutionary algorithm suggests an intricate co-evolution of multi-behavioral predator-prey behavioral strategies.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  29     Total Times Cited:  29     Cited Reference Count:  29 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Included""}",10.1111/j.1600-0706.2009.17204.x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),HABITAT SELECTION GAMES;WAITING GAME;RISK;VIGILANCE;DYNAMICS;ECOLOGY;Algorithms;Prednisolone,,

After being popularized by Wang et al. in 2016 (J. Math. Biol., 73:1179-1204), the indirect effect of fear has been studied through its incorporation into several mathematical models in different ecological settings. The impact of fear effect in a three-species food chain model, where the top predator is a generalist predator, is not yet investigated. In the present work, a three-species food chain model incorporating the fear of predators is investigated, where the fear of generalist predator impedes the growth rate of the specialist predator, and the fear of specialist predator reduces the birth rate of the prey. We derive criteria for the existence of all possible non-negative equilibrium points and provide some remarks on their local stability. Additionally, the conditions for the occurrence of various local bifurcations have been established. In the absence of fear, we show that the model exhibits chaotic dynamics via periodic-doubling route when the birth rate of the prey is varied. Furthermore, we observe that fear can alter the stability of the model from a chaotic zone to a stable zone via period-halving route. It is also observed that with an appropriate choice of parameter values, fear can act as a damping mechanism, preventing the unwanted blow-up of the generalist predator in finite time. We provide numerical simulations to support our analytical findings.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  2     Total Times Cited:  2     Cited Reference Count:  49 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Included""}",10.1140/epjp/s13360-021-01900-3     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),PREDATOR-PREY INTERACTIONS;BIOLOGICAL-CONTROL;FORAGING BEHAVIOR;ADDITIONAL FOOD;RISK;CHAOS;ECOLOGY;AVOIDANCE;PROVISION;Food,,

In a series of experiments, we have studied the behavioural responses of goldfish (prey) and little egrets (predator) when brought together in a large laboratory apparatus - an aviary with three pools of water. To obtain a baseline, we measured their behaviour in an aviary without manipulating any variable (Katz et al., 2010). Because the results of that study suggested that both fish and egrets follow the rules of optimal foraging, we undertook a series of experiments in which we manipulated the number of food patches (Katz et al., 2014a), the number of fish per pool (Katz et al., 2014b; Vijayan et al., 2018a), and the size of goldfish refuges (vijayaa et al., 2018b). In each case, the results supported the hypothesis of optimal behaviour. Mitchell (2018, this issue) makes four predictions about the behaviours of both species as the abundance of fish resources changes in a system such as the aviary. Specifically: (1) Prey should respond very weakly, if at all, to variation in the food ration among patches. (2) The predator should allocate more time to patches with a higher prey-food ration. (3) When moving to another patch, the predator should choose the patch with the higher prey-food ration more often than it would at random. (4) The predator will kill more prey in patches receiving a larger ration of prey-food.        Aims: Explore the effect of varying the abundance of fish-food on the behaviours of goldfish and little egrets in the aviary. Determine whether variation in their behaviours agrees with the predictions of Mitchell's theoretical model.        Methods: We used little egrets (the predators) and goldfish (the prey). We conducted experiments in two identical aviaries (7 m diameter). Each aviary contained three separate patches, i.e. three pools (1.52 m diameter, 0.60 m deep, similar to 1000 litres), each open to foraging by a single egret in the aviary. A fixed cover (22.75 cm radius) at the centre of each pool provided a refuge for the goldfish. Each pool had 15 fish. We manipulated intraspecific competition by offering three different amounts of goldfish food in an aviary each day: full (1.13 g per day), half (0.56 g per day), and quarter (0.28 g per day) rations. We then observed and recorded the behaviours of both players for 6 hours.        Results: Patch-to-patch variation in the food ration had no effect on fish activity. But the egret allocated more time to foraging in the patch where the prey-food ration was highest (1.13 g). When moving to another patch, the egret moved to the patches containing high food rations (1.13 and 0.56 g) rather than the patch with the lowest food ration (0.28 g). And the predator caught significantly fewer goldfish in these poorest patches. Thus all four predictions were validated.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  7     Total Times Cited:  7     Cited Reference Count:  59 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",,food abundance;goldfish;intraspecific competition;little egret;optimal foraging;predator-prey behavioural games;HABITAT SELECTION;GROUP-SIZE;SPACE USE;SELFISH HERD;WAITING GAME;VIGILANCE;RISK;DILUTION;MODELS;FISH;Prednisolone,,

This occurs because migration is considered a costly behavioral strategy that presumably confers explicit benefits to migrants in the form of either decreased predation risk (predation risk avoidance hypothesis) or increased nutrition (forage maturation hypothesis). To test these hypotheses, we studied a partially migratory moose (Alces alces) population and contrasted explicit measures of predation risk (i.e., offspring survival) and nutrition (i.e., accumulation of endogenous energy reserves) between resident and migratory subpopulations. We relied on data collected from migratory and nonmigratory radio-marked moose (n = 67) that inhabited a novel study system located in coastal Alaska between 2004 and 2010. In this area, 30% of the population resides year-round on a coastal foreland area, while 48% migrate to either a small island archipelago or a subalpine ridge system (the remainder exhibited one of six different low-occurrence strategies). Overall, we determined that accumulation of body fat during the growing season did not differ between migratory or resident modalities. However, calf survival was 2.6-2.9 times higher for individuals that migrated (survival, islands = 0.49 +/- 0.16 [mean +/- SE], n = 35; ridge = 0.52 +/- 0.16, n = 33) than those that did not (survival, resident = 0.19 +/- 0.08, n = 57). Our results support the predation risk avoidance hypotheses, and suggest that migration is a behavioral strategy that principally operates to reduce the risk of calf predation and does not confer explicit nutritional benefits. We did not directly detect trade-offs between predation risk and nutrition for migratory individuals. Yet we identify an indirect life history mechanism that may mildly dampen the apparent fitness benefits of migration. The proximate factors accounting for differences in migration-specific neonate survival are likely linked to accessibility of refugial habitats for moose at local and landscape scales, landscape factors that affect hunting efficacy of large carnivores, and interactions with rural human communities. Conservation of ungulate populations can be aided by integrating knowledge about migratory behavior, life history strategies, and factors that alter ungulate vulnerability, particularly those induced by human activity.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  38     Total Times Cited:  42     Cited Reference Count:  78 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1890/13-0054.1     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Alaska;Alces alces;forage maturation;moose;nutrition;predation risk;ungulate migration;ALCES-ALCES;TRADE-OFFS;WOLF PREDATION;ALASKAN MOOSE;GLACIER BAY;UNGULATE;CARIBOU;STRATEGIES;DISPERSION;SELECTION;Prednisolone,,

Many prey species exhibit antipredator behaviours when threatened, yet prey response to temporal variation in predation risk is not well-understood, despite being foundational to predator-prey dynamics and an important consideration among game population managers and recreationalists. Aims. To examine white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) behaviour in response to temporal variation in predation risk imposed by recreational hunters and to assess the effect of deer sex and age on antipredator response. Methods. Global positioning system (GPS) collars were used to monitor behaviour of female and male deer in response to diel and weekly patterns of recreational hunting in Alabama, USA. Key results. Deer behaviour on weekends (i.e. Friday-Sunday), corresponding to periods of elevated risk, was similar to behaviour on weekdays (i.e. Monday-Thursday). However, when behaviour was examined by individual day of the week, movement rate decreased by 17%, net displacement decreased by 31%, and the probability of activity decreased by 24% during daylight hours on Sundays compared with Fridays. Behavioural changes among days were not detected at night. Daytime behavioural shifts persisted until Wednesdays, despite lower weekday hunting activity. Behavioural variation by deer sex and age was also observed. Conclusions. Deer perceive temporal variation in predation risk and modify their behaviour to reduce the likelihood of predation. Variation in response across sex and age classes may be driven by previous experience with hunters and/or survival- and fitness-related trade-offs that affect prey decisions at the individual level. Antipredator response was not initially detectable when examined at a broad temporal scale (i.e. weekend vs weekday); however, a behavioural response was shown with a finer-scale analysis (i.e. individual day of the week), which more closely reflected the pattern of risk fluctuation. Implications. Our findings demonstrated the acute awareness of a large ungulate to temporal changes in predation risk and provided insight into ways in which these prey behaviourally respond to reduce the likelihood of predatory encounters. Future studies should consider the temporal scale of risk fluctuation when examining antipredator response to avoid false conclusions. Ungulate hunters and managers can use this information to more efficiently achieve their goals.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  72 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1071/WR21047     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Alabama;antipredator behaviour;hunting pressure;movement;Odocoileus virginianus;predation risk;predator-prey dynamics;white-tailed deer;WHITE-TAILED DEER;ANTIPREDATOR BEHAVIOR;PREY;RESPONSES;MOVEMENT;MOOSE;PRECIPITATION;SURVIVAL;WOLVES;MAST;Prednisolone,,

Information regarding a predator's location can be determined through chemosensory cues from urine, faeces, visual and/or acoustic signals and anal gland secretions; and in several lab and field-based studies it has been seen that these cues mediate behavioural changes within prey species. These behaviours are often linked to fear and avoidance, which will in turn increase the prey's survival rate. In many studies dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) have been used as a predator species, however, no research has addressed a dog's innate ability to detect predator scents, hence the rationale behind this study. We assessed the innate ability of the untrained domestic dog to detect faecal scents of wild Eurasian brown bear (Ursus arctos arctos) and European lynx (Lynx lynx). The study monitored 82 domestic dogs across the UK and Norway. The dogs were exposed to the two predator faecal scents from Eurasian brown bear and European lynx, a herbivore faecal scent of Eurasian beaver (Castor fiber) and water control. Measurements were taken upon the time spent within a 40 cm radius of each scent and changes in the dog's heart rate when within this 40 cm radius. We found dogs spent a decreased length of time around the predator scents and had an increased heart rate in relation to their basal heart rate. We conclude that dogs can innately sense predator scents of brown bear and lynx and elicit fear towards these odours, as shown through behavioural and physiological changes.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  4     Total Times Cited:  4     Cited Reference Count:  48 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s10071-020-01379-y     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Canis familiaris;Detection-dogs;Scent;Ursus arctos;Lynx lynx;Innate behaviour;PREY NAIVETE;HEART-RATE;RESPONSES;PERSISTENCE;BEHAVIOR;ANIMALS;ECOLOGY;ODORS;SHIFT;RISK;Dogs;Prednisolone,,

If searching for food and searching for exploitation opportunities within a group are mutually exclusive alternatives, the decision to use one or the other is modeled as a producer-scrounger game because the value of each alternative is frequency dependent. Stochastic producer-scrounger models generally assume that producer provides a more variable and uncertain reward than does the scrounger and hence is a riskier foraging alternative. Socially foraging animals that are attempting to reduce their risk of starvation should therefore alter their use of producer and scrounger alternatives in response to changes in energy budget. We observed flocks of nutmeg mannikins (L. punctulata) foraging in an indoor aviary to determine whether their use of producer and scrounger alternatives were risk sensitive. Analyses of the foraging rewards of three flocks of seven birds confirm that producer is a riskier foraging strategy than is scrounger, although the difference in risk is rather small. We then submitted two other flocks to two different energy budgets and observed the foraging decision of four focal birds in each flock. All but one bird increased their relative use of the riskier producer strategy in the low food reserve treatment, but the overall use of producer did not differ significantly between treatments, providing evidence for a small but consistent effect.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  19     Total Times Cited:  19     Cited Reference Count:  37 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1093/beheco/arh127     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),energy budget;producer-scrounger game;risk-sensitive foraging;social foraging;STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENT;PRODUCER;MODEL;PREDATION;BIRDS;SCROUNGERS;VARIANCE;PREY,,

In other words, we are limiting the harvesting of species below a certain age so that they can grow to a certain specific size or age and thus protect juvenile populations. Reproduction of the prey population can also be greatly impeded due to the influence of the fear effect.

These interactions are generally between unrelated individuals with no social connection. There are, however, examples of violent behaviour which occurs within groups of individuals who otherwise cooperate to live, have significant social bonds and may also be related, and that is the primary focus of this paper. Examples are in the establishment and maintenance of dominance hierarchies, or in infanticide, where (usually) incoming males attempt to kill existing infants in a group. Such violence can seem paradoxical, but in fact is often perfectly logical for the individual perpetrating the violence, as distinct from the group as a whole. We discuss such situations from the perspective of evolutionary game theory, and also consider wider questions of interspecific violence.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  32 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.3389/neuro.08.051.2009     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),dominance;infanticide;kleptoparasite;game theory;ESS;DOMINANCE HIERARCHIES;GAME-THEORY;EVOLUTION;BEHAVIOR;KLEPTOPARASITISM;INTERFERENCE;REPRODUCTION;WINNER;MODEL;Violence;Reward,,

When this behavioural plasticity is considered-such as in predator-prey games-the role of abiotic factors is usually ignored. An abiotic factor that exerts strong influence on the physiology and behaviour of many animals is ambient temperature, although it is often ignored from game models as it is implicitly assumed that both predators and prey are homothermic. However, poikilotherms' performance may be reduced in cold conditions due to reduced muscle function, limiting the prey-capture ability of predators and the predator-avoidance and foraging abilities of prey. Here, we use a game-theoretic predator-prey model in which diel temperature changes influence foraging gains and costs to predict the evolutionarily stable diel activity of predators. Our model predicts the range of patterns observed in nature, including nocturnal, diurnal, crepuscular and a previously unexplained post-sunset crepuscular pattern observed in some sharks. In general, smaller predators are predicted to be more diurnal than larger ones. The safety of prey when not foraging is critical, explaining why predators in coral reef systems (with safe refuges) may often have different foraging patterns to pelagic predators. We make a range of testable predictions that will enable the further evaluation of this theoretical framework for understanding diel foraging patterns in poikilotherms.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  44 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/1365-2656.13608     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),antipredator behaviour;ectothermy;evolutionarily stable strategy;hunting strategies;optimal foraging;refuge use;sharks;ANTIPREDATOR BEHAVIOR;VERTICAL MIGRATIONS;TEMPORAL VARIATION;SHARKS;TEMPERATURE;RISK;PLASTICITY;NICHE;Prednisolone,,

In this paper, an eco-epidemic model of the predator-prey system is investigated by considering disease in prey population and selective behavior of predator; the cost of fear is taken as affecting the reproduction and intraspecies competition of vulnerable prey population, and also lowers the disease transmission; the predators are assumed to cooperate with each other for the hunting while the susceptible/infected prey population takes refuge. Numerical observations of the system demonstrate that the cost of fear causing a reduction in the birth rate of susceptible prey has a destabilizing role, whereas the levels of fear responsible for the increase in the intraspecies competition of susceptible prey and eradication of the disease prevalence have the capacity to stabilize an otherwise unstable system. The intensity of disease prevalence potentially affects the dynamics of the ecosystem by altering its stability around the infection-free state and the coexistence of prey and predator species. However, refuge taken by the susceptible/infected prey has the potential to restore the stability of the system. Moreover, the chaotic nature of the system is observed if the preference of predators for susceptible prey or hunting cooperation of predators exceeds a fixed value. We also investigate the dynamics of the system by letting some of the model parameters to vary with time. Our numerical results for the seasonally forced system showcase different dynamical features including periodic solutions, higher periodic solutions, bursting patterns, and chaos.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  67 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1140/epjp/s13360-022-02751-2     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),PREY MODEL;NONAUTONOMOUS MODEL;RISK;DISEASE;CHAOS;OSCILLATIONS;FOOD;UNCERTAINTY;SENSITIVITY;POPULATION;Prednisolone;Seasons,,

It is obtained that the system has rich dynamics elaborated by the presence of Turing patterns and Turing-Hopf bifurcation. The nature of Turing patterns is successfully discussed by analyzing the amplitude equations with a multiple-timescale technique. After studying the stability of these amplitude equations, it has been identified various Turing patterns driven by the cross-diffusion.

We evaluated the non-consumptive effects (NCEs) of an active predator, the grey wolf (Canis lupus), by simultaneously tracking wolves and the behaviour, body fat, and pregnancy of elk (Cervus elaphus), their primary prey in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. When wolves approached within 1 km, elk increased their rates of movement, displacement and vigilance. Even in high-risk areas, however, these encounters occurred only once every 9 days. Ultimately, despite 20-fold variation in the frequency of encounters between wolves and individual elk, the risk of predation was not associated with elk body fat or pregnancy. Our findings suggest that the ecological consequences of actively hunting large carnivores, such as the wolf, are more likely transmitted by consumptive effects on prey survival than NCEs on prey behaviour.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  102     Total Times Cited:  104     Cited Reference Count:  49 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/ele.12133     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Anti-predator behaviour;drought;elk;grey wolf;grizzly bear;non-consumptive effects;predation risk;predator hunting mode;ungulate;Yellowstone;PREDATION RISK;HABITAT SELECTION;TROPHIC CASCADE;ELK;WOLVES;RESPONSES;DYNAMICS;NUTRITION;PATTERNS;SURVIVAL;Prednisolone,,

Whether perceived risk corresponds with actual fitness outcomes, however, remains an important open question. We simultaneously measured how habitat changes due to a common invasive grass (cheatgrass, Bromus tectorum) affected the perceived risk, habitat selection, and apparent survival of a small mammal, enabling us to assess how well perceived risk influenced important behaviors and reflected actual risk. We measured perceived risk by nocturnal rodents using a giving-up density foraging experiment with paired shrub (safe) and open (risky) foraging trays in cheatgrass and native habitats. We also evaluated microhabitat selection across a cheatgrass gradient as an additional assay of perceived risk and behavioral responses for deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) at two spatial scales of habitat availability. Finally, we used mark-recapture analysis to quantify deer mouse apparent survival across a cheatgrass gradient while accounting for detection probability and other habitat features. In the foraging experiment, shrubs were more important as protective cover in cheatgrass-dominated habitats, suggesting that cheatgrass increased perceived predation risk. Additionally, deer mice avoided cheatgrass and selected shrubs, and marginally avoided native grass, at two spatial scales. Deer mouse apparent survival varied with a cheatgrass-shrub interaction, corresponding with our foraging experiment results, and providing a rare example of a native plant mediating the effects of an invasive plant on wildlife. By synthesizing the results of three individual lines of evidence (foraging behavior, habitat selection, and apparent survival), we provide a rare example of linkage between behavioral responses of animals indicative of perceived predation risk and actual fitness outcomes. Moreover, our results suggest that exotic grass invasions can influence wildlife populations by altering risk landscapes and survival.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  20     Total Times Cited:  20     Cited Reference Count:  89 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1002/ece3.2785     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),habitat homogenization;habitat selection;human-induced habitat change;invasion biology;invasive species;optimal foraging;predation risk;GREAT-BASIN DESERT;PREDATION RISK;BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS;LOGISTIC-REGRESSION;ECOLOGICAL IMPACTS;CHEATGRASS;RODENTS;RESPONSES;ECOSYSTEM;PLANTS;Poaceae,,

Indeed, the ability of the individual to balance between the costs and benefits of various options and adopt a wise decision is critical for the well-being of the animal. In the current study, we investigated gender differences in risk taking and decision making in male and female Smith's zokors (Eospalax smithii), a subterranean rodent species, in the defensive withdrawal apparatus (DWA) under novel, predator and conditioned contexts. Under novel context, males showed more exploratory and less hiding behavior than females especially during the first half of the testing session. However, under predator and conditioned contexts, non-significant sexually dimorphic behavioral differences were observed. Nevertheless, analysis of the performance of each gender separately across the three contexts revealed that males showed strong aversion to the predator and conditioned contexts. By contrast, females did not significantly vary their behavioral responses when exposed to the predator and conditioned cues.

In this study, we propose a predator-prey fishery model introducing the cost of fear into prey reproduction with Holling type-II functional response and prey-dependent harvesting and investigate the global dynamics of the proposed model. For the system without harvest, it is shown that the level of fear may alter the stability of the positive equilibrium, and an expression of fear critical level is characterized. For the harvest system, the existence of the semitrivial order-1 periodic solution and positive order-q (q & GE;1) periodic solution is discussed by the construction of a Poincare map on the phase set, and the threshold conditions are given, which can not only transform state-dependent harvesting into a cycle one but also provide a possibility to determine the harvest frequency. In addition, to ensure a certain robustness of the adopted harvest policy, the threshold condition for the stability of the order-q periodic solution is given. Meanwhile, to achieve a good economic profit, an optimization problem is formulated and the optimum harvest level is obtained.

However: good genes may depend on the social environment, and female choice for good genes should be context dependent. The side-blotched lizard, Uta stansburiana, exhibits genetically based throat colors (orange, blue, or yellow) that could be used as a sexually selected signal since they reliably predict the genetic quality of mates. The frequencies of male and female morphs cycle between years, and both male and female morphs have an advantage when rare; thus genetic quality will depend on morph frequency. A female should choose a sire that maximizes the reproductive success of both male and female progeny. We examine a game theoretical model that predicts female mate choice as a function of morph frequency and population density. The model predicts the following flexible mate choice rule: both female morphs should prefer rare males in 'boom years' of the female cycle (e.g., 'rarest-of-N rule'), but prefer orange males in 'crash years' of the female cycle ('orange-male rule'). Cues from the current social environment should be used by females to choose a mate that maximizes the future reproductive success of progeny, given the social environment of the next generation. We predict that the cue is the density of aggressive orange females.

We therefore expect changes in predation risk to influence the ability of hyrax groups to migrate from site to site. We combine mathematical metapopulation models of hyrax behavioral ecology, as well as compartmental models of disease dynamics, to investigate the effect of microhabitat alteration and varying perceived predation risk on disease incidence. Our models indicate that such fine-scale alterations in predation risk can have surprising effects on pathogen prevalence, leading to the emergence of epizootic cycles. Regular (predictable) cycles and chaotic (unpredictable) cycles may occur as predation risk is reduced. Under some conditions, cycles may result from very small changes in predation risk or environmental conditions.

It is assumed that some of the insect pests migrate due to the fear of wolf spiders. Positivity, boundedness, and parameter regimes for an ecologically realistic parameter set is identified. We have derived the local and global stability conditions for the proposed system. The existence of Hopf-bifurcation, direction and stability conditions of the bifurcating periodic solutions have been discussed. It is observed that the fear of wolf spiders has a stabilizing impact on system dynamics. It contributes positively to the role of wolf spiders as a biocontrol agent.

This largely affects the patterns of their spatio-temporal distribution and leads to clustered breeding. Although making informed settlement decisions is expected to be beneficial for individuals, such territory clusters may potentially provide additional fitness benefits (e.g., through the dilution effect) or costs (e.g., possibly facilitating nest localization if predators respond functionally to prey distribution). Thus, we hypothesized that the fitness consequences of following a conspecific attraction strategy may largely depend on the composition of the predator community. We developed an agent-based model in which we simulated the settling behavior of birds that use a conspecific attraction strategy and breed in a multi-predator landscape with predators that exhibited different foraging strategies. Moreover, we investigated whether Bayesian updating of prior settlement decisions according to the perceived predation risk may improve the fitness of birds that rely on conspecific cues. Our results provide evidence that the fitness consequences of conspecific attraction are predation-related. We found that in landscapes dominated by predators able to respond functionally to prey distribution, clustered breeding led to fitness costs. However, this cost could be reduced if birds performed Bayesian updating of prior settlement decisions and perceived nesting with too many neighbors as a threat. Our results did not support the hypothesis that in landscapes dominated by incidental predators, clustered breeding as a byproduct of conspecific attraction provides fitness benefits through the dilution effect. We suggest that this may be due to the spatial scale of songbirds' aggregative behavior. In general, we provide evidence that when considering the fitness consequences of conspecific attraction for songbirds, one should expect a trade-off between the benefits of making informed decisions and the costs of clustering.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  5     Total Times Cited:  5     Cited Reference Count:  60 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1371/journal.pone.0119132     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),WARBLER PHYLLOSCOPUS-SIBILATRIX;SOCIAL INFORMATION USE;HABITAT SELECTION;PUBLIC INFORMATION;NEST PREDATION;ECOLOGICAL TRAPS;PRIMEVAL FOREST;ANIMAL BEHAVIOR;DENSITY;BIRDS;Cost-Benefit Analysis;Prednisolone,,

We develop a general game-theoretical model, the watchful babbler game, in which prey signal awareness to predators. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for alarm calls to function as honest signals. We show that signals can honestly reveal prey awareness if (1) the prey's sense of predation risk accurately reflects the probability that the predator is present, and (2) greater awareness of the predator allows the prey a greater chance of escape. When honest signalling is possible, the model predicts that prey will be more willing to signal when predators are common than when predators are rare, and that greater pursuit costs to the predator will allow cheaper signals by the prey.

The standard approach to such two-player games is to assume that each player chooses a single action and that the evolutionarily stable action of each player is the best given the action of its opponent. We argue that, instead, most two-player games should be modelled as involving a series of interactions in which opponents negotiate the final outcome, Thus we should be concerned with evolutionarily stable negotiation rules rather than evolutionarily stable actions. The evolutionarily stable negotiation rule of each player is the best rule given the rule of its opponent.

The role of other factors, such as numerical risk dilution caused by the mere presence of companions, has been neglected. In a model, we explore a dilution game when foragers in groups have access to protective cover. We show that foragers can take advantage of risk dilution and that this leads to changes in vigilance with group size without the need to invoke collective detection. We identify a cost to maintaining high levels of vigilance as less vigilant foragers gather food faster and so depart the group sooner (to reach cover) leaving more vulnerable stragglers behind. In groups, there is a scramble to reach safe sites that can induce a reduction in vigilance levels. Such a mechanism operates less forcefully in large groups because individuals in these groups are less vulnerable to the departure of an individual. We also demonstrate that individuals should adopt lower levels of vigilance, to reach safe sites sooner, when predator evasion is compromised or when the rate of food intake is high.

Here, in three experiments, we built on previous interactive tasks to create an online foraging game for studying divided attention in human participants exposed to the (simulated) risk of predation. Participants used a ""sheep"" icon to collect items from different target categories randomly distributed across the display. Each trial also contained ""wolf"" objects, whose movement was inspired by classic studies of multiple object tracking. When participants needed to physically avoid the wolves, foraging patterns changed, with an increased tendency to switch between target categories and a decreased ability to prioritise high reward targets, relative to participants who could safely ignore them. However, when the wolves became dangerous by periodically changing form (briefly having big eyes) instead of by approaching the sheep, foraging patterns were unaffected. Spatial disruption caused by the need to rapidly shift position-rather the cost of reallocating attention-therefore appears to influence foraging in this context. These results thus confirm that participants can efficiently alternate between target selection and tracking moving objects, replicating earlier single-target search findings. Future studies may need to increase the perceived risk or potential costs associated with simulated danger, in order to elicit the extended run behaviour predicted by animal models of foraging, but absent in the current data.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  1     Total Times Cited:  1     Cited Reference Count:  85 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1186/s41235-021-00299-w     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Foraging;Predation;Visual search;Divided attention;Multiple target search;Dual-task;Multiple-object tracking;WORKING-MEMORY CAPACITY;VISUAL-SEARCH;SOFT CONSTRAINTS;TRADE-OFF;RISK;TRACKING;TIME;EXPLOITATION;STRATEGIES;ALLOCATION;Humanities;Humanism;Humans;Prednisolone,,

Predator behavior may also affect the nest-site selection decisions of females: when predators respond strongly to prey density (e.g. through area-restricted search), the optimal strategy may be for birds to disperse their nests widely across the landscape. Conversely, clustered nests may benefit from dilution effects in the presence of incidental nest predators. In dabbling ducks, nest distributions range from clustered to dispersed and there is conflicting evidence about whether clustering enhances or reduces nest success, although presumably this depends on predator behavior. Here, I present results from an agent-based model designed to answer two qualitative questions: are clustered nests more or less successful than dispersed nests, and how does that relative benefit vary depending on predator behavior? I modeled three types of waterfowl nest predators (to emulate the foraging behavior of skunks and foxes) that differ in their degree of spatial memory and their capacity for area-restricted search, foraging on different distributions of nests. As hypothesized, well-dispersed nests survived better with fox-like predators that performed area-restricted searches. On the other hand, clustered nests survived better when incidental skunk-like predators were present, but survival was dramatically reduced in the presence of foxes; thus, small changes in the predator community (e.g. introduction of foxes) without commensurate changes in nest clustering could have important effects on waterfowl populations. On simulated landscapes containing both clustered and dispersed nests and a mixed predator community, average nest success for clustered versus randomly placed nests was the same across possible predator mixes, but the variance in success for clustered nests was much higher; this suggests that there may be risk-reward tradeoffs when nesting near conspecifics. That said, the degree to which ducks can actually assess and respond to the presence of conspecifics is largely unknown, and it is believed that nest sites are selected based on habitat. Results from this model, combined with empirical data suggest that commonly used management strategies that promote nest clustering, such as restoration of small parcels of habitat, can actually create ecological traps for nesting ducks, driven by predator behavior.

Conflicts between large mammalian predators and humans present a challenge to conservation efforts, as these events drive human attitudes and policies concerning predator species. Unfortunately, generalities portrayed in many empirical carnivore landscape selection studies do not provide an explanation for a predator's occasional use of residential development preceding a carnivore-human conflict event. In some cases, predators may perceive residential development as a risk-reward trade-off.        2. We examine whether state-dependent mortality risk-sensitive foraging can explain an apex carnivore's (Puma concolor) occasional utilization of residential areas. We assess whether puma balance the risk and rewards in a system characterized by a gradient of housing densities ranging from wildland to suburban. Puma GPS location data, characterized as hunting and feeding locations, were used to assess landscape variables governing hunting success and hunting site selection. Hunting site selection behaviour was then analysed conditional on indicators of hunger state.        3. Residential development provided a high energetic reward to puma based on increases in prey availability and hunting success rates associated with increased housing density. Despite a higher energetic reward, hunting site selection analysis indicated that pumas generally avoided residential development, a landscape type attributed with higher puma mortality risk. However, when a puma experienced periods of extended hunger, risk avoidance behaviour towards housing waned.        4. This study demonstrates that an apex carnivore faces a trade-off between acquiring energetic rewards and avoiding risks associated with human housing. Periods of hunger can help explain an apex predator's occasional use of developed landscapes and thus the rare conflicts in the wildland-urban interface. Apex carnivore movement behaviours in relation to human conflicts are best understood as a three-player community-level interaction incorporating wild prey distribution.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  37     Total Times Cited:  38     Cited Reference Count:  88 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/1365-2656.12801     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),camera traps;cougar puma concolor;energetics;housing avoidance;human-predator conflict;patch use;risk-reward trade-off;step selection function;RUSSIAN FAR-EAST;LARGE CARNIVORES;MULE DEER;RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT;WESTERN WASHINGTON;MOVEMENT PATTERNS;POPULATION-SIZE;PROTECTED AREAS;MOUNTAIN LIONS;HABITAT USE;Prednisolone,,

The survivor's dilemma (shortly: SVD) game consists in the following: a group member either surely survives alone by fleeing, while its defensive mate may be killed: or tries to save its mate's life, risking to get killed. The dilemma is that, in every single attack, fleeing ensures maximal survival probability, but if its mate survives by fighting both, and they remain together, its risk to be killed at the next attack will be lower. We show :hat, if defense is successful enough, then the one-attack game is a prisoner's dilemma (PD), where fleeing is the strict ESS. We have additively decomposed the SVD game, according to the survival of the group mate of the focal prey, into two games: the aim of the ""collective game"" is survival of the group of prey. Counter-wise, the aim of the ""hostile game"" is survival alone (focal prey survives and its mate is killed by the predator). We obtain the following results: if the attack number is large enough, the multi-attack SVD game is dominated by the ""collective game"" in the sense that each individual can ensure its own maximal survival probability by maximizing the group survival probability in each attack. In the hostile game, the only strict ESS is the fleeing strategy. In the collective game there are two different cases: either defense is a unique strict ESS, or the collective game is bistable, i.e. fleeing and defense are local strict ESS's. If defense is the only strict ESS in the collective game, and the attack number is large enough, defense replaces fleeing strategy in the multi-attack SVD game. However, in the bistable case, defense cannot invade into the fleeing population. It is shown that, if the interaction between relatives is frequent enough, than defense can replace fleeing strategy, in spite of the fact that in the well-mixed population the collective game is bistable.

Yet empirical tests of optimal foraging generally take place with only one of the two species free to adjust its behaviour.        Question: Do predators and prey follow predictions of optimality when they are interacting and each is free to adjust its behaviour?        Organisms: Commercially purchased common goldfish (Carassius attain's) and wild-caught little egrets (Egretta garzetta).        Experimental arenas: Covered circular enclosures (radius 3.5 m), each with three artificial pools (radius 0.76 m). Each pool had a habitat where the goldfish could hide, and an open habitat where they could collect their food but were exposed to predation.        Methods: An egret was allowed to forage in an arena each of whose pools contained 15 goldfish (replaced daily according to the number consumed). We measured the time goldfish spent in the open and under cover; the time it took for them to emerge from cover after an egret visit (i.e. the refractory time, rf); the number of fish eaten; and the time an egret took to return to a pool after leaving it (i.e. the return time, rt).        Predictions: Qualitative: during an egret's visit to a pool, fish should spend a greater proportion of time hiding and thus become less and less vulnerable to predation. Quantitative: An egret will maximize its chance to encounter exposed fish by adopting a return time equal to fish refractory time (rt = rf). An egret should maximize its catch of fish if rt = rf.        Results: In the presence of an egret, goldfish significantly reduced the time they spent in the open (2.09% vs. 65.4%). The average goldfish refractory time was 20.31 min. The average little egret return time was 21.09 min. These values are not significantly different. Egrets catch the most fish if rt = 18.6 min (not significantly different from that observed).","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  23     Total Times Cited:  23     Cited Reference Count:  29 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",,anti-predatory behaviour;foraging games;optimal foraging behaviour;predator-prey interaction;HABITAT SELECTION;TIME ALLOCATION;GERBILS;APPREHENSION;BEHAVIOR;ENERGY;STATE;RISK;FISH;Prednisolone,,

We explored the influence of predation on lek dynamics using a stochastic dynamic game model based on the lek-breeding greater sage grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) and its principal avian predator, the golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos). The model predicts time-dependent male lek attendance as a function of factors affecting both mating success (female arrival rate, male numbers, and social status) and predation risk (eagle arrival rate and group size). Dominant males are predicted to arrive sooner and leave later than subordinates, especially if mating skew is high, predation risk is low, or the relationship between lek size and female arrival rate is weak. Both high mean levels of predation risk and small lek size should reduce lek attendance, but the relative tendency of predators to attack large versus small leks has little influence on predicted lekking behavior. Field observations confirmed the predicted effects of female arrival rate, lek size, male dominance, and weather-dependent predator arrival rates on lek departure times. Predicted effects of female arrival rates and male dominance on seasonal lek attendance were also supported. Our model provides an empirically supported adaptive explanation for short-term lek dynamics. It also suggests alternative interpretations for phenomena previously invoked to support the hotshot and skew models of lek formation.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  42     Total Times Cited:  43     Cited Reference Count:  52 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1086/380419     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),lek mating system;dynamic game theory;greater sage grouse;mating skew;density dependence;predation;MALE MATING SKEW;FEMALE CHOICE;SEXUAL SELECTION;LEKKING;BEHAVIOR;EVOLUTION;ORGANIZATION;DISPERSION;COURTSHIP;PATTERNS;Prednisolone,,

The dominant is able to exclude the subordinate from the habitat it is currently using. Fluctuations in weather result in variable daily metabolic costs. The model predicts that in certain circumstances subordinates maintain a higher level of fat reserves than dominants, thereby hedging against uncertain future metabolic costs and restricted foraging opportunities. Acquiring larger fat reserves exposes the subordinate to higher levels of predation risk, reducing its probability of surviving the winter, relative to the dominant. The model's predictions are in agreement with observations and experiments, and lend support to the hypothesis that winter fattening strategies are complex adaptations to specific environmental, spatial, and social conditions.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  73     Total Times Cited:  74     Cited Reference Count:  41 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.2307/3546222     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),TIT PARUS-MONTANUS;DARK-EYED JUNCOS;PREDATION RISK;BODY-WEIGHT;WINTER FLOCKS;SOCIAL RANK;BEHAVIOR;BIRDS;FAT;SURVIVAL,,

Various animals, from sea urchins to damselfly larvae, use injury of conspecifics to infer the presence of predators [1-7]. In many fish [1, 8, 9], skin damage causes the release of chemicals that elicit escape and fear in members of the shoal. The chemical nature of the alarm substance (""Schreckstoff"" in German) [1], the neural circuits mediating the complex response, and the evolutionary origins of a signal with little obvious benefit to the sender, are unresolved. To address these questions, we use biochemical fractionation to molecularly characterize Schreckstoff. Although hypoxanthine-3 N-oxide has been proposed to be the alarm substance [10, 11], it has not been reliably detected in the skin [12] and there may be other active components [13, 14]. We show that the alarm substance is a mixture that includes the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chondroitin. Purified chondroitins trigger fear responses. Like skin extract, chondroitins activate the mediodorsal posterior olfactory bulb, a region innervated by crypt neurons [15] that has a unique projection to the habenula [16]. These findings establish GAGs as a new class of odorants in fish, which trigger alarm behavior possibly via a specialized circuit.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  136     Total Times Cited:  139     Cited Reference Count:  35 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.cub.2012.01.061     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),ALARM SUBSTANCE;GLYCOSAMINOGLYCANS;CELLS;RECOGNITION;SULFATE;DANIO,,

These models predict that prey should leave a chosen patch only if and when the food depletes below some critical level. In nature, however, prey individuals may regularly move among food patches, even in the apparent absence of food depletion. We suggest that such prey movement is part of a predator-prey ""shell game"", in which predators attempt to learn prey location, and the prey attempt to be unpredictable in space. We investigate this shell game using an individual-based model that allows predators to update information about prey location, and permits prey to move with some random component among patches, but with reduced energy intake. Our results show the best prey strategy depends on what the predator does. A non-learning (randomly moving) predator favors non-moving prey - moving prey suffer higher starvation and predation. However, a learning predator favors prey movement. In general, the best prey strategy involves movement biased toward, but not completely committed to, the richer food patch. The strategy of prey movement remains beneficial even in combination with other anti-predator defenses, such as prey vigilance.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  120     Total Times Cited:  121     Cited Reference Count:  46 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Included""}",10.1034/j.1600-0706.2002.990205.x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),HABITAT SELECTION;GROUP-SIZE;TRADE-OFF;RISK;VIGILANCE;ECOLOGY;DEFENSE;SEARCH;MEMORY;LEVEL;Decision Making;Prednisolone,,

The feeding effort of herbivores should reflect adaptive decisions that only become rewarding when foraging gains exceed 1) the metabolic costs, 2) the missed opportunity costs of not foraging elsewhere, and 3) the foraging costs of anti-predator behaviour. Two aspects of these costs remain largely unexplored: the link between the strength of plant-herbivore interactions and the spatial scale of food-quality assessment, and the predator-prey spatial game. We modeled the foraging effort of free-ranging plains bison (Bison bison bison) in winter, within a mosaic of discrete meadows. Spatial patterns of bison herbivory were largely driven by a search for high net energy gains and, to a lesser degree, by the spatial game with grey wolves (Canis lupus). Bison decreased local feeding effort with increasing metabolic and missed opportunity costs. Bison herbivory was most consistent with a broad-scale assessment of food patch quality, i.e., bison grazed more intensively in patches with a low missed opportunity cost relative to other patches available in the landscape. Bison and wolves had a higher probability of using the same meadows than expected randomly. This co-occurrence indicates wolves are ahead in the spatial game they play with bison. Wolves influenced bison foraging at fine scale, as bison tended to consume less biomass at each feeding station when in meadows where the risk of a wolf's arrival was relatively high. Also, bison left more high-quality vegetation in large than small meadows. This behavior does not maximize their energy intake rate, but is consistent with bison playing a shell game with wolves. Our assessment of bison foraging in a natural setting clarifies the complex nature of plant-herbivore interactions under predation risk, and reveals how spatial patterns in herbivory emerge from multi-scale landscape heterogeneity.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  19     Total Times Cited:  19     Cited Reference Count:  85 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1371/journal.pone.0073324     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),PREY SHELL GAMES;HABITAT SELECTION;PATCH USE;ENERGY EXPENDITURES;SEARCHING BEHAVIOR;DECISION-MAKING;SCALE MOVEMENT;PLAINS BISON;ECOLOGY;INFORMATION;Prednisolone,,

In the absence of predators, models predict that prey (e.g., herbivores) will aggregate strongly in habitats where their resources (e.g., plants) are abundant. However, game theoretic models predict that in the presence of predators, prey use of resource-rich habitats declines. Paradoxically, it is instead predators that are predicted to be mostly strongly aggregated in areas where the prey's resources (plants) are abundant, even though the predators themselves do not utilize these resources. This striking result has been dubbed the ""leapfrog effect"" by Sih (1998, 2004). Here I explore the possibility that predictions for predator and prey habitat selection are sensitive to the assumption that predators forage free from any predation risk of their own. I contrast the predictions of a 3-trophic level model with those of a 4-trophic level model, and show that incorporating the constraint imposed on ""intermediate predator"" foraging behavior by the risk of attack from ""top predators"" can produce substantial changes in model predictions. Most importantly, the leapfrog effect is largely eliminated. Top predators impose important constraints on foraging decisions made by intermediate predators, opening up new solutions for herbivores.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  34     Total Times Cited:  35     Cited Reference Count:  22 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Included""}",10.1560/K796-DMB2-546Q-Y4AQ     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),FOOD-WEB;INTRAGUILD PREDATION;EVOLUTION;DYNAMICS;ECOLOGY;Prednisolone,,

We investigated whether larval woodfrog, Rana sylvatica, tadpoles learn to adjust the intensity of their antipredator responses to match (1) the temporal patterns of risk they experience throughout the day and (2) the risk level of a predator. We also examined how tadpoles incorporate temporally conflicting information on the risk posed by the predators. Our results indicate that tadpoles show dynamic adjustments in their behaviour, adjusting their response to predators according to the level of threat associated with the predator and the time of day at which the predator represents the most significant threat. Moreover, tadpoles responded to conflicting information by adjusting their response intensity depending on the nature of the change in vulnerability (whether the risk increased or decreased) and the time that the conflicting information was experienced (whether it was recent or old information). We discuss our results within the context of predator predictability in natural systems and game theory approaches to the behavioural response race between predator and prey.

Apart from direct killing, predator induces fear among their prey which affects the life-history, behavioral changes, and reproduction potential of the prey population. On the other hand, the Allee effect has a great impact on regulating the population size, community structure and population dynamics. In the present investigation, we modify the Hastings-Powell (HP) [1991] model by considering the cost of fear in middle predator and the Allee effect in top predator. The stability conditions for the biologically feasible equilibria are derived using linear stability analysis. Considering the cost of fear and the Allee effect as key parameters, the Hopf bifurcation analysis is carried out around the interior equilibrium. The direction of Hopf bifurcation and the stability of the bifurcating periodic solution are determined by applying the normal form theory and center manifold theorem. Our numerical results suggest that the fear effect can stabilize the system. It is observed that high levels of fear among middle predator decrease the population density of top predator. We also observe that if the Allee parameter is increased, then the system becomes stable from chaotic oscillations. However, further increase in the Allee parameter leads to population extinction. We have also drawn several one- and two-parameter bifurcation diagrams which explore rich dynamical behaviors.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  65 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Included""}",10.1142/S0218127422500845     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Food chain model;Allee effect;bifurcation analysis;chaos;Lyapunov exponent;ECO-EPIDEMIOLOGIC MODEL;POPULATION-DYNAMICS;DENSITY-DEPENDENCE;PREDATOR;CHAOS;PREY;SYSTEM;RISK;STABILITY;REDUCE,,

Yet there is still a general lack of information about the strategies of prey to minimize predation risk from multiple predators at the landscape level. Here we examined the distribution of seven African ungulate species in the fenced Karongwe Game Reserve (KGR), South Africa, as a function of predation risk from all large carnivore species (lion, leopard, cheetah, African wild dog, and spotted hyena). Using observed kill data, we generated ungulate-specific predictions of relative predation risk and of riskiness of habitats. To determine how ungulates minimize predation risk at the landscape level, we explicitly tested five hypotheses consisting of strategies that reduce the probability of encountering predators, and the probability of being killed. All ungulate species avoided risky habitats, and most selected safer habitats, thus reducing their probability of being killed. To reduce the probability of encountering predators, most of the smaller prey species (impala, warthog, waterbuck, kudu) avoided the space use of all predators, while the larger species (wildebeest, zebra, giraffe) only avoided areas where lion and leopard space use were high. The strength of avoidance for the space use of predators generally did not correspond to the relative predation threat from those predators. Instead, ungulates used a simpler behavioral rule of avoiding the activity areas of sit-and-pursue predators (lion and leopard), but not those of cursorial predators (cheetah and African wild dog). In general, selection and avoidance of habitats was stronger than avoidance of the predator activity areas. We expect similar decision rules to drive the distribution pattern of ungulates in other African savannas and in other multi-predator systems, especially where predators differ in their hunting modes.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  174     Total Times Cited:  174     Cited Reference Count:  51 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1890/10-0126.1     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),"African ungulates;antipredator strategies;conditional logistic regression;habitat selection;Karongwe Game Reserve, South Africa;large carnivore;multi-predator-prey systems;predator hunting mode;spatial distribution;utilization distribution;RESOURCE SELECTION;HABITAT SELECTION;ANTIPREDATOR BEHAVIOR;NATIONAL-PARK;FEAR;ELK;RESPONSES;EXAMPLE;SPIDERS;CUES;Prednisolone",,

Animals of a population may also differ in their assessment of how dangerous it is to fight in relation to the risk of predation. To address this issue, we classified 36 males of the small South American cichlid fish, Nannacara anomala, according to how much each individual inspected a model predator in the presence of its own mirror image. We assigned each fish to either of two groups: bold (prone to inspecting) or cautious (averse to inspecting). We allowed bold and cautious dyads, matched for equal body weight within each dyad, to fight in the presence of the model predator. During these fights, there was no significant difference between the groups in inspection of the model predator, but bold dyads escalated significantly faster to mouth wrestling than cautious dyads. Bold dyads also performed significantly more low-intensity behavior (i.e., visual assessment and tail beating) compared to cautious dyads. Only two fights (22%) in the bold group and one fight (11%) in the cautious group had a clear winner. About 3 months later, the same dyads fought again without the model predator present. Both groups then decreased the time to reach mouth wrestling, but bold dyads still escalated significantly faster than cautious dyads to month wrestling. There was no significant difference in the use of low-intensity behaviors between groups. The results suggest that there are individual differences in the response toward predators among male N. anomala, which also correlates with the performance of fighting behavior when the animals' perceived risk of predation increases. behavior, Nannacara anomala, predation risk.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  43     Total Times Cited:  44     Cited Reference Count:  23 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1093/beheco/13.4.439     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),boldness;cichlids;contest behavior;Nannacara anomala;predation risk;SEQUENTIAL ASSESSMENT GAME;PUMPKINSEED SUNFISH;EVOLUTION;AGGRESSION;BOLDNESS;SHYNESS;Risk-Taking,,

Proactive adjustments are generally well-studied, whereas the frequency, strength and duration of reactive adjustments remain largely unknown. We studied the space use and habitat selection of GPS-collared zebras Equus quagga from 2 to 48 h after an encounter with lions Panthera leo. Lion-zebra encounters generally occurred close to artificial waterholes (<1 km). Two hours after an encounter, zebras were more likely to have fled than stay when the encounter occurred in more risky bushy areas. During their flight, zebras selected grasslands more than usual, getting great visibility. Regardless of their initial response, zebras finally fled at the end of the night and reached areas located far from waterholes where encounters with lions are less frequent. The large-scale flights (similar to 4-5 km) of zebras led to a local zebra depression for lions. Zebras that had fled immediately after the encounter resumed their behaviour of coming close to waterholes on the following day. However, zebras that had initially stayed remained far from waterholes for an extra 24 h, remaining an elusive prey for longer. The delay in the flight decision had different short-term consequences on the lion-zebra game. We reveal that the spatial context of the encounter shapes the immediate response of prey, and that encountering predators induces strong behavioural responses: prey flee towards distant, safer, areas and have a constrained use of key resource areas which are at the heart of the predator-prey game at larger spatio-temporal scales. Nighttime encounters were infrequent (once every 35 days on average), zebra responses were short-lived (<36 h) but occurred over a large spatial scale (several km).","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  55     Total Times Cited:  55     Cited Reference Count:  52 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/oik.02555     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),RESOURCE SELECTION;HABITAT SELECTION;GROUP-SIZE;RISK;MOVEMENTS;VIGILANCE;BEHAVIOR;CARIBOU;ELK;LANDSCAPE;Prednisolone,,

Prey populations are comprised of individuals that differ in perception of and willingness to take risk; therefore, studying how different types of individuals respond to predation risk is necessary to fully understand prey dynamics. Playbacks were used to experimentally manipulate perceived predation risk in nest-box populations of wild great tits (Parus major) to examine the nonconsumptive effects of avian predators on prey behavior and morphology, and to explore individual differences in prey response. Individuals responded to our treatment, and responses differed depending on both treatment and pre-manipulation behavioral type. Birds in areas exposed to predator playback tended to decrease in body mass more than birds exposed to nonthreatening (control) playback. Differences between treatment groups were mainly driven by initially fast exploring birds: In the control treatment, fast explorers increased in mass, whereas the initially fast exploring birds in the predation treatment decreased in mass. Furthermore, birds exposed to predator playback decreased exploratory tendency compared with controls. These findings demonstrate that predation risk alters great tit behavior (exploration) and morphology (body mass) and that plasticity in response to risk relates to an individual's willingness to take risks. Our findings suggest that individuals differ in susceptibility to predation risk, causing adaptive individual differences in responsiveness to changes in predation risk. Acknowledging individuality in responses to perceived predation risk has important consequences for understanding prey dynamics.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  30     Total Times Cited:  30     Cited Reference Count:  81 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1093/beheco/arv228     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),animal behavior;animal personality;Parus major;perceived predation risk;predation danger;TIT PARUS-MAJOR;GREAT TIT;HABITAT SELECTION;PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY;BODY-MASS;EXPLORATORY-BEHAVIOR;FITNESS CONSEQUENCES;TAKING BEHAVIOR;FAT RESERVES;EFFECT SIZE;Prednisolone,,

Hunting cooperation among predators can impose fear effects on the prey population, thereby decreasing the prey's birth rate. Considering this fact, we propose a model that incorporates hunting cooperation among predators and the fear-induced birth reduction in the prey population. We have done the complete dynamical analysis, including boundedness of solutions, persistence of the system, existence of all equilibria and their local and global stability, existence of Hopf bifurcation and its direction and stability, and existence of saddle-node bifurcation. We analyze Hopf bifurcation with respect to the hunting cooperation parameter and saddle-node bifurcation by varying the predation rate. Moreover, we analyze the multi-stability of the system and observe that bi-stability occurs in two different scenarios. In the spatially extended system, we provide a detailed stability analysis and obtain the conditions for Turing instability. Various Turing patterns such as spots, holes, and stripes are obtained and discussed the biological significance of these patterns for the two-dimensional spatial model.

Often a forager will have to choose between feeding sites that differ in both energetic gain rate and predation risk. The ideal site will have a high gain rate and low risk of predation. However, intake rate will often decrease when the patch is shared with other foragers and it may be optimal for some individuals to feed elsewhere. Within the framework of ideal free theory, we investigate the distribution of foragers that will equalise individual fitness gains. We focus on a two-patch environment with continuous inputs of food. With reference to existing experimental studies, we examine the effects of risk dilution, food input rates and an animal's expectations of the future. We identify the effect of total animal numbers when one patch is subject to predation risk and the other is safe. Conditions under which the difference in intake rate in the two patches is constant are identified, as are conditions in which the ratio of animals in the two patches is constant, If current conditions do not alter future expectations an increase in input rates to the patches promotes increased use of the risky patch. Yet, if conditions are assumed to persist indefinitely the opposite effect is seen. When both patches are subject to predation risk, dilution of risk favours more extreme distributions, and may lead to more than one stable distribution. The results of these models are used to critically analyse previous work on the energetic equivalence of risk. This paper is intended to help guide the development of new experimental studies into the energy-risk trade-off.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  65     Total Times Cited:  66     Cited Reference Count:  46 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s002650050225     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),ideal free theory;predation risk;LIFE-HISTORY;BEHAVIORAL DECISIONS;FOOD;SIZE;ENERGY;FISH;TEMPERATURE;COMPETITION;RESPONSES;AVOIDANCE;Prednisolone,,

We propose that animals respond to the costs of an 'accident landscape' in conjunction with predation risk and energetic costs when deciding when, where, and how to move in their daily lives. We develop a novel theoretical framework describing how features of physical landscapes interact with animal size, morphology, and behaviour to affect the risk and severity of accidents, and predict how accident risk might interact with predation risk and energetic costs to dictate movement decisions across the physical landscape.

In systems where both predator and prey share similar sensory modalities and cognitive abilities, such as with marine mammals, the dynamic nature of predator-prey interactions is poorly understood. The costs and benefits of these anti-predator adaptations need to be evaluated and quantified based on the dynamic engagement of predator and prey. Many theoretic models have addressed the complexity of predator-prey relationships, but few have translated into testable mechanistic models. In this study, we developed a spatially-explicit, geo-referenced, individual-based model of a prototypical adult dusky dolphin off Kaikoura, New Zealand facing a more powerful, yet infrequent predator, the killer whale. We were interested in two primary objectives, (1) to capture the varying behavioral game between a clever prey and clever predator based on our current understanding of the Kaikoura system, (2) to compare evolutionary costs vs. benefits (foraging time and number of predator encounters) for an adult non-maternal dusky dolphin at various levels of killer whale-avoidance behaviors and no avoidance rules. We conducted Monte Carlo simulations to address model performance and parametric uncertainty. Mantel tests revealed an 88% correlation (426 x 426 distance matrix, km(2)) between observed field sightings of dusky dolphins with model generated sightings for non-maternal adult dusky dolphin groups. Simulation results indicated that dusky dolphins incur a 2.7% loss in feeding time by evolving the anti-predator behavior of moving to and from the feeding grounds. Further, each evolutionary strategy we explored resulted in dolphins incurring an additional loss of foraging time. At low killer whale densities (appearing less than once every 3 days), each evolutionary strategy simulated converged towards the evolutionary cost of foraging, that is, the loss in foraging time approached the 2.7% loss experienced by evolving near shore-offshore movement behavior. However, the highest level of killer whale presence resulted in 38% decreases in foraging time.

Here, we present adaptive, state-dependent mathematical models for analysing issues about behavioural syndromes. We find that asset protection (where individuals with more 'assets' tend be more cautious) and starvation avoidance, two state-dependent mechanisms, can explain short-term behavioural consistency, but not long-term stable behavioural types (BTs). These negative-feedback mechanisms tend to produce convergence in state and behaviour over time. In contrast, a positive-feedback mechanism, state-dependent safety (where individuals with higher energy reserves, size, condition or vigour are better at coping with predators), can explain stable differences in personality over the long term. The relative importance of negative-and positive-feedback mechanisms in governing behavioural consistency depends on environmental conditions (predation risk and resource availability). Behavioural syndromes emerge more readily in conditions of intermediate ecological favourability (e. g. medium risk and medium resources, or high risk and resources, or low risk and resources). Under these conditions, individuals with higher initial state maintain a tendency to be bolder than individuals that start with low initial state; i.e. later BT is determined by state during an early 'developmental window'. In contrast, when conditions are highly favourable (low risk, high resources) or highly unfavourable (high risk, low resources), individuals converge to be all relatively bold or all relatively cautious, respectively. In those circumstances, initial differences in BT are not maintained over the long term, and there is no early developmental window where initial state governs later BT. The exact range of ecological conditions favouring behavioural syndromes depends also on the strength of state-dependent safety.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  214     Total Times Cited:  219     Cited Reference Count:  81 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1098/rstb.2010.0207     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),behavioural syndromes;animal personality;state-dependent behaviour;state-dependent safety;boldness;predation risk;PERSONALITY-TRAITS;INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES;ANTIPREDATOR BEHAVIOR;ANIMAL PERSONALITY;TRADE-OFF;EVOLUTION;PREDATION;SIZE;TEMPERAMENT;POPULATIONS,,

Spatial aggregation is assumed to be a predator-swamping mechanism that involves a cost of an increased risk of calf death from disease. A female's decision to join an aggregation or to calve solitarily depends on her parturition date relative to other individuals and on the number of other females in the birth area. The results are robust to changes in other parameter values. The Evolutionarily Stable Strategy is to join an aggregation and stay for the full period of neonatal vulnerability if calving early in the birth period, to join the aggregation but to leave it early if calving later in the birth period, and to calve solitarily if calving at the end of the birth period. The possible effects of human disturbance on female behaviour are investigated, and testable hypotheses are presented about the behaviour of females in the birth period. The game-theoretic approach to the decision to join an aggregation developed here is broadly applicable to many problems in the ecology of grouping behaviour. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Both the consumers and the predators are continuously reproducing and maximise fitness by maximising the per capita growth rate. The impact of the predator's presence on consumer behaviour, and the effects of type I and II functional responses on the behaviour of both species are considered. In the analyses, consumers were allowed to co-ordinate activity or behave independently in relation to other consumers. The ESS-analysis of the game ensures that no mutant can invade the system. The independent activity was found to be optimal in all analyses, while the co-ordinated activity was only optimal at full activity where the two activity strategies coincided. The model showed that consumers should change activity to account for predation risk. Activity generally decreased with predation risk. Concerning the energetic aspects, both activity and search speed were important to account for the reproductive output. The functional responses influenced the optimum activity and search speed of consumers and predators. In general, the optimum behaviours showed complex non-linear responses in relation to the resource and the consumer density. A predator type II functional response had profound impacts on the properties of the optima, the stability and presence of alternative strategies. As a result of the optimum behaviours, the realised functional responses of both species became sigmoidal.

Sentinel interchanges often appear orderly, and groups with sentinels rarely have zero or many sentinels. A dynamic game was constructed to examine if these observations about sentinels could be based on selfish actions by individual group members. In this game, each group member chose to forage or be a sentinel based on its own energetic state and the actions of others. Sentinels received a selfish antipredator benefit if their ability to detect approaching predators more than compensated for their increased exposure to undetected predators. Provided sentinels were relatively safe and that detection information spread to other group members when sentinels detected predators, sentinels appeared highly coordinated for all combinations of parameters. This apparent coordination was based on mutualism because each individual gained by being a sentinel when other group members were not (and foraging when other group members were being sentinels). The model was very robust, but exact level of sentinel behavior varied somewhat with changes in foraging and predation parameters. This model could best be tested by testing its assumptions about sentinel safety, foraging-predation trade-offs, and information transfer in groups.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  88     Total Times Cited:  90     Cited Reference Count:  62 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1086/286070     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),WATCHMANS SONG HYPOTHESIS;DWARF MONGOOSE;VIGILANCE BEHAVIOR;GROUP-SIZE;OPTIMIZATION MODELS;PRISONERS-DILEMMA;PREDATION;COOPERATION;BIRDS;RISK,,

However, poisonous plants such as larkspur (Delphinium spp.) can present a threat comparable to predation. In the western United States, larkspur diminishes the economic and ecological sustainability of cattle production by killing valuable animals and restricting management options. Recommendations for mitigating losses have long focused on seasonal avoidance of pastures with larkspur, despite little evidence that this is practical or effective. Our ongoing research points to the cattle herd itself as the potential solution to this seemingly intractable challenge and suggests that larkspur and forage patchiness may drive deaths. In this paper, we present an agent-based model that incorporates neutral landscape models to assess the interaction between plant patchiness and herd behavior within the context of poisonous plants as predator and cattle as prey. The simulation results indicate that larkspur patchiness is a potential driver of toxicosis and that highly cohesive herds may greatly reduce the risk of death in even the most dangerous circumstances. By placing the results in context with existing theories about the utility of herds, we demonstrate that grouping in large herbivores can be an adaptive response to patchily distributed poisonous plants. Lastly, our results hold significant management-relevant insight, both for cattle producers managing grazing in larkspur habitat and in general as a call to reconsider the manifold benefits of herd behavior among domestic herbivores.

Perceived predation risk constitutes a major factor that should shape adaptive phenotypic plasticity in sleep but it is unclear to what degree an individual can tailor sleep to different types of risk. If animals base behavioural decisions on the predation landscape then we would expect individuals to adjust their sleep behaviour when exposed to changes in predation risk. Here we investigated the plasticity of phenotypic sleep in wild great tits roosting in nestboxes and exposed to different types of predation risk. Following our prediction, when exposed to experimentally increased perceived predation risk from owls, Strix aluco (a bird that can prey on birds solely outside their roosting cavity), individuals increased total sleep duration. Contrary to our prediction, when exposed to experimentally increased perceived predation risk from martens, Martes martes (a mammal that can prey on birds inside cavities), individuals woke up less often during the night, but otherwise did not change their sleep behaviour. Birds did not alter total time spent awake during the night in response to predator exposure. Our findings demonstrate that individual great tits modify their sleep behaviour in response to changes in predation risk. Ecological factors including exposure to predators, resource availability and reproductive competition may act as significant constraints on natural sleep patterns and warrant further investigation with free- living individuals.

Using Giving up Densities (GUDs), we examined foraging behaviour decisions of goldfish groups foraging in open and cover habitats. We specifically compared the foraging behaviour of goldfish in the two habitats in the presence and absence of a predator (little egret). In the absence of a predator, the goldfish equalised GUDs between open and cover habitats. However, in the presence of a predator, the GUDs were significantly lower in the cover microhabitat than in the open. The goldfish spent almost twice the time foraging in the open GUD trays in the absence of the predator. The number of visits and time spent per visit to the foraging patch were significantly higher in the absence of a predator. However, the goldfish group harvested food pellets at a similar rate in both risky and non-risky environments, suggesting that in risky environments they forego apprehension and instead rely on time allocation to manage risk.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  4     Total Times Cited:  4     Cited Reference Count:  22 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1080/03949370.2018.1477837     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),foraging;predation risk;giving up densities;microhabitats;goldfish;little egret;PATCH USE;ANTIPREDATOR BEHAVIORS;FORAGING BEHAVIOR;PREY;GERBILS;SIZE;GAME;Prednisolone,,

First, we modify the Rosenzweig-MacArthur predator-prey model by incorporating the effects of habitat complexity on the carrying capacity and fear effect of prey and predator functional response. We establish conditions for the existence and stability of all feasible equilibrium points of the non-spatial model, and later we prove the existence of Hopf and transcritical bifurcations in different parametric phase-planes analytically and numerically. The stability of the spatial system is studied, and we discuss the conditions for Turing instability. Selecting suitable control parameter from the Turing space, the existence conditions for stable patterns are derived using the amplitude equations. Results obtained from theoretical analysis of the amplitude equations are justified by numerical simulation results near the critical parameter value. Further, from numerical simulation, we illustrate the effect of diffusion of the dynamical system in the spatial domain by different pattern formations. Thus, our model clearly shows that the fear effect of prey and predator's functional response makes an anti-predator behaviour including habitat complexity which helps the prey to survive in the spatio-temporal domain through diffusive process.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  9     Total Times Cited:  9     Cited Reference Count:  72 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Included""}",10.1140/epjp/s13360-020-00897-5     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),DENSITY-DEPENDENT MORTALITY;STABILITY ANALYSIS;CARRYING-CAPACITY;HOPF-BIFURCATION;TURING PATTERNS;MODEL;DYNAMICS;REFUGES;RISK;Prednisolone,,

A few models have predicted the resulting distributions of predators and prey, but little empirical data exist to test these predictions and to examine how abiotic and biotic factors shape the distributions. Thus, we observed how Anax dragonfly nymphs and Pacific tree frog tadpoles (Pseudacris regilla) either together or separately distributed themselves in an arena with a high- and a low-prey resource patch. Trials were conducted in high- and low-light conditions to manipulate predation risk and to view the effects of this abiotic factor. Counter to the model predictions, we found that predators were not more abundant in high-resource (HR) patches, and they thus did not force prey toward being uniformly distributed. Using a model selection approach to assess what factors affected predator and prey patch-switching movement, we found that prey more often left patches that had more predators present, but predators surprisingly more often left patches with more prey present. Light levels did not affect predation risk; however, in the dark with the associated reduction in visual information predators preferred HR patches. This caused a lower coincidence of prey and predators in patches. Predators also switched patches less often when they occupied the same patch as the other predator. This suggests that predator distributions, and indirectly prey distributions, are affected by the risk of intraguild predation.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  18     Total Times Cited:  18     Cited Reference Count:  34 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1093/beheco/arn107     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),HABITAT SELECTION GAMES;DENSITY-DEPENDENCE;PREY;PREDATOR,,

Here, we use adaptive dynamics to model changes in behavioural rates of a predator and prey, while explicitly allowing both to make decisions simultaneously. Our model focuses on a two-patch situation. The prey can move between an open patch, allowing for energy intake but also predation risk, and a refuge with no possibility of energy intake or predation risk. The predator can move between that patch, where it can attack prey, and an alternative patch that provides a fixed rate of energy intake, and consequently imposes a missed opportunity cost (MOC) of using the focal patch. The model predicts how the rates of movement by the players are influenced by specific parameters, including the predator's lethality and MOC, as well as the information available to the players. For example, our model predicts that the time a prey takes to emerge from its refuge and the time a predator waits for the prey to emerge depend on the sequence of events leading to the prey entering the refuge. For instance, the predator would leave the patch more quickly and the prey would emerge from the refuge more quickly if the prey entered the refuge after a failed attack rather than as part of its time allocation.

This risk can derive from natural predators and also from direct and indirect human pressures. A starving forager will often take risks that a less hungry forager would not. At a highly seasonal and human-modified site, we predicted that arboreal samango monkeys (Cercopithecus albogularis labiatus) would show highly flexible, responsive, risk-sensitive foraging. We first determined how monkeys use horizontal and vertical space across seasons to evaluate if high-risk decisions (use of gardens and ground) changed with season, a proxy for starvation risk. Then, during a subsequent winter, we offered equal feeding opportunities (in the form of high-value, raw peanuts) in both gardens and forest to see if this short-term change in food availability and starvation risk affected monkeys' foraging decisions. We found that during the food-scarce winter, monkeys foraged outside indigenous forest and in gardens, where they fed on exotic species, especially fallen acorns (Quercus spp.), despite potential threats from humans. Nevertheless, and as predicted, when given the choice of foraging on high-value foods in gardens vs. forest during our artificial foraging experiment, monkeys showed a preference for a safer forest habitat. Our experiment also indicated monkeys' sensitivity to risk in the lower vertical strata of both habitats, despite their previous extensive use of the ground. Our findings support one of the central tenets of optimal foraging theory: that risk of starvation and sensitivity to the variation in food availability can be as important drivers of behavior as risk of predation.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  10     Total Times Cited:  11     Cited Reference Count:  43 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s10764-016-9913-1     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Cercopithecus mitis;Giving-up density;Human disturbance;Landscape of Fear;Guenon;PREDATION-RISK;MITIS-ERYTHRARCHUS;PATCH USE;FEAR;IMPACT;AVAILABILITY;POPULATION;BEHAVIOR;Humanities;Humanism;Humans;Risk Management;Mountaineering;Haplorhini;South Africa;Seasons,,

We present a mechanistic, trait-based model of DVM for the different components of a pelagic community. Specifically, we consider size, sensory mode and feeding mode as key traits, representing a community of copepods that prey on each other and are, in turn, preyed upon by fish. Using game-theoretic principles, we explore the optimal distribution of the main groups of a planktonic pelagic food web simultaneously. Within one single framework, our model reproduces a whole suite of observed patterns, such as size-dependent DVM patterns of copepods and reverse migrations. These patterns can only be reproduced when different trophic levels are considered at the same time. This study facilitates a quantitative understanding of the drivers of DVM, and is an important step towards mechanistically underpinned predictions of DVM patterns and biologically mediated carbon export.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  7     Total Times Cited:  7     Cited Reference Count:  69 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1098/rspb.2019.1645     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),diel vertical migrations;trait-based ecology;food webs;game theory;optimal strategies;VISUAL PREDATION RISK;SCATTERING LAYER;SPRAT SPRATTUS;ZOOPLANKTON;BEHAVIOR;SIZE;TRAIT;DISTRIBUTIONS;ATLANTIC;CARBON,,

Question: How should the parent behave to maximize reproductive success when mortality to both parent and young are considered?        Mathematical method: Using an optimality model, we establish new formulae to describe parental behaviour when there is a trade-off between growth rate of the young and mortality risk to both parent and young.        Key assumptions: We consider mortality functions for both parent and young. These comprise the sum of a background mortality risk and a mortality risk attributed to parental behaviour.        Conclusions: Mortality is an important parameter in the determination of parental behaviour. As the dependence of the mortality of the young on parental effort grows, a parent should invest a greater proportion of time in being vigilant for predators. An increase in other mortality parameters prompts the opposite effect. Mortality should be described by multiple parameters to predict fully how a parent should behave.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  62 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",,growth rate;mortality risk;optimality model;parental care;PERCEIVED PREDATION RISK;NEST VISITATION RATES;CLUTCH-SIZE;GREAT TIT;PARUS-MAJOR;PATCH USE;BIRDS;FOOD;EVOLUTION;STRATEGIES,,

In the model there is a trade-off between gaining information about predation risk and anti-predator behaviour. All predator attacks lead to death for the prey, so that the prey learns about predation risk by virtue of the fact that it is still alive. We show that it is not usually optimal to behave as if the current unbiased estimate of the predation risk is its true value. We consider two different ways to model reproduction; in the first scenario the animal reproduces throughout its life until it dies, and in the second scenario expected reproductive success depends on the level of energy reserves the animal has gained by some point in time. For both of these scenarios we find results on the form of the optimal strategy and give numerical examples which compare optimal behaviour with behaviour under simple rules of thumb. The numerical examples suggest that the value of the optimal strategy over the rules of thumb is greatest when there is little current information about predation risk, learning is not too costly in terms of predation, and it is energetically advantageous to learn about predation. We find that for the model and parameters investigated, a very simple rule of thumb such as 'use the best constant control' performs well. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

When intruders are persistent, a past conspecific intrusion informs a territorial resident that future intrusions by the same animal are likely: Using a mathematical model, I examine the effects that past territorial intrusions call have on antipredator behaviour. Past territorial intrusions rarely affect a resident animal's time to hide (the optimal behaviour is to hide as soon as the predator initiates its attack). In contrast, past intrusions should shorten the length of time during which territory holders remain in hiding, with the magnitude of this effect depending on the time of the predator's attack, the re-intruder's pattern of return, and the intrusion rates of other conspecifics. The results of the model show that we need more information on patterns of re-intruders' behaviour, and emphasize that a similar functional explanation could underlie other behavioural changes following territorial and/or aggressive encounters (such as winner/loser effects or changes in display frequency and territorial vigilance). Differences between my findings and those from previous studies suggest that the trade-off between antipredator behaviour and territorial defence can involve different costs from the trade-off between antipredator behaviour and foraging.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  9     Total Times Cited:  9     Cited Reference Count:  30 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1098/rspb.2001.1637     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),antipredator behaviour;predation risk;territoriality;aggressive behaviour;trade-off;mathematical model;TIT PARUS-MAJOR;PREDATION RISK;AGGRESSIVE INTERACTIONS;FIGHTING BEHAVIOR;EUMECES LATICEPS;LIZARD;ACQUISITION;RESPONSES;DECISIONS;DEFENSE;Mathematics,,

The foraging benefits of group living include increased efficiency and reduced need for vigilance, but social foraging can also encourage theft of captured prey from conspecifics. The payoffs of stealing prey from others (scrounging) versus capturing prey (producing) may depend not only on the frequency of each foraging strategy in the group but also on an individual's ability to steal. By observing the foraging behavior of juvenile coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), we found that, within a group, relatively smaller coho acted primarily as producers and took longer to handle prey, and were therefore more likely to be targeted by scroungers than relatively larger coho. Further, our observations suggest that the frequency of scrounging may be higher when groups contained individuals of different sizes. Based on these observations, we developed a model of phenotype-limited producer-scrounger dynamics, in which rates of stealing were structured by the relative size of producers and scroungers within the foraging group. Model simulations show that when the success of stealing is positively related to body size, relatively large predators should tend to be scroungers while smaller predators should be producers. Contrary to previous models, we also found that, under certain conditions, producer and scrounger strategies could coexist for both large and small phenotypes. Large scroungers tended to receive the highest payoff, suggesting that producer-scrounger dynamics may result in an uneven distribution of benefits among group members thatunder the right conditionscould entrench social positions of dominance.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  6     Total Times Cited:  6     Cited Reference Count:  64 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s12080-018-0375-2     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Kleptoparasitism;Game theory;Coho salmon;Social foraging;ONCORHYNCHUS-KISUTCH;SELECTIVE PREDATION;FIGHTING BEHAVIOR;ZEBRA FINCHES;TACTIC USE;JUVENILE;DOMINANCE;KLEPTOPARASITISM;SUCCESS;RISK,,

As bears must increase mass for winter survival, they should be sensitive to temporal allocation of antipredator responses to periods of highest risk. We expected bears to reduce foraging activity at the expense of food intake in the morning hours when risk was high, but not in the afternoon, when risk was low. We used fine-scale GPS-derived activity patterns during the 2 weeks before and after the onset of the annual bear hunting season. At locations of probable foraging, we assessed abundance and sugar content, of bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus), the most important autumn food resource for bears in this area. Bears decreased their foraging activity in the morning hours of the hunting season. Likewise, they foraged less efficiently and on poorer quality berries in the morning. Neither of our foraging measures were affected by hunting in the afternoon foraging bout, indicating that bears did not allocate antipredator behavior to times of comparably lower risk. Bears effectively responded to variation in risk on the scale of hours. This entailed a measurable foraging cost. The additive effect of reduced foraging activity, reduced forage intake, and lower quality food may result in poorer body condition upon den entry and may ultimately reduce reproductive success.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  26     Total Times Cited:  27     Cited Reference Count:  56 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s00442-016-3729-8     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Activity;Antipredator behavior;Bilberry;Foraging efficiency;Risk allocation;BROWN BEARS;URSUS-ARCTOS;ANTIPREDATOR RESPONSE;HABITAT SELECTION;HUMAN DISTURBANCE;ELK;PATTERNS;CARNIVORES;LANDSCAPE;ECOLOGY;Prednisolone,,

Yet we know little about how variations in scales of heterogeneity influence decisions on patch use and habitat selection, and how they impact spatial distribution and evolution. In particular, we need to know whether the choice of habitats and patches emerges from a hierarchy of decisions, whether resource consumption correlates closely with space use, and whether different types of individuals are associated with patterns of spatial distribution. I address these knowledge gaps with field experiments that manipulated the risk and quality of foraging patches exploited by male meadow voles. I used clear versus wooden covers to create risky versus safe foraging sites and added supplemental food to create rich versus poor habitats. I assessed whether the resources harvested from each tray matched its frequency of use by groups of voles expressing different temperament scores. Habitat and patch use did not fit a simple hierarchy of decisions because animals merged space use and foraging speed in a sophisticated strategy of risk management. Giving-up densities mirrored activity densities at the scale of safe versus risky patches but not at the scale of safe versus risky or rich versus poor habitats. Voles tended to prefer one habitat over another for reasons independent of the experimental manipulations. Groups of voles with different temperament scores were not linked to foraging types but were linked to habitat preference. The bias in habitat use by different behavioural types provides a potential mechanism for the evolutionary divergence of populations occupying different habitats.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  58 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1080/15659801.2016.1232683     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),evolutionary games;giving-up density;habitat selection;patch use;spatial scale;vole;IDEAL FREE DISTRIBUTION;ANIMAL PERSONALITY;PUBLIC INFORMATION;SEXUAL SELECTION;PREDATION RISK;PREFERENCE;EVOLUTION;BEHAVIOR;STATE;EXPERIENCE,,

Here the payoffs to two alternative male mating tactics (call and satellite) were examined in anurans using a stochastic dynamic game. The basic model considers an iteroparous species with a prolonged breeding season and fairly low energetic costs and predation risks. The model assumes that female chorus attendance is affected by weather, time of year and male chorusing intensity. Results show that interactions between energetic costs of calling, density-dependent predation risk and female arrival rates, and frequency-dependent mating success produce distinct temporal waves of male chorusing despite continuously favourable environmental conditions. Relative to second-year males, first-year males attended choruses less often and were more likely to become satellites. When the energetic costs of calling were increased, waves became shorter and less frequent, and some older calling males switched to satellite behaviour. Satellites were less common when breeding season length was constrained by extrinsic factors such as seasonal weather patterns. Extrinsic constraints may also affect system stability: if female arrival rates are independent of male chorusing intensity, an evolutionarily stable strategy occurs only if the breeding season is short. Even without extrinsic constraints, the breeding season may be short if predation rates on adults are sufficiently high, or if satellites intercept a large fraction of incoming females. Thus, the 'explosive' breeding systems observed in many anuran species could result from either biotic or abiotic causes.

In this paper, we propose to explore the dynamics of a phytoplankton-zooplankton-fish system, with fear-induced birth rate reduction in the middle predator by the top predator and an additional food source for the top predator fish. Phytoplankton-zooplankton and zooplankton-fish interactions are handled using Holling type IV and II responses, respectively. First, we prove the well-posedness of the system, followed by results related to the existence of possible equilibrium points. Conditions under which a different number of interior equilibria exist are also derived here. We also show this existence numerically by varying the intrinsic growth rate of phytoplankton species, which demonstrates the model's vibrant nature from a mathematical point of view. Furthermore, we performed the local and global stability analysis around the above equilibrium points, and the transversality conditions for the occurrence of Hopf bifurcations and transcritical bifurcations are established. We observe numerically that for low levels of fear, the system behaves chaotically, and as we increase the fear parameter, the solution approaches a stable equilibrium by the route of period-halving. The chaotic behavior of the system at low levels of fear can also be controlled by increasing the quality of additional food. To corroborate our findings, we constructed several phase portraits, time-series graphs, and one- and two-parametric bifurcation diagrams. The computation of the largest Lyapunov exponent and a sketch of Poincare maps verify the chaotic character of the proposed system. On varying the parametric values, the system exhibits phenomena like multistability and the enrichment paradox, which are the basic qualities of non-linear models. Thus, the current study can also help ecologists to estimate the parameters to study and obtain such important findings related to non-linear PZF systems. Therefore, from a biological and mathematical perspective, the analysis and the corresponding results of this article appear to be rich and interesting.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  47 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Included""}",10.1063/5.0069474     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),PREDATOR-PREY SYSTEM;DYNAMICS;RISK;COMPETITION;STABILITY;IMPACT;Food Additives;Phytoplankton,,

Soc.,17,2,,"Eichhorn, M and Johst, K and Seppelt, R and Drechsler, M",,English,,,"The expansion of renewable energies, such as wind power, is a promising way of mitigating climate change. Because of the risk of collision with rotor blades, wind turbines have negative effects on local bird populations, particularly on raptors such as the Red Kite (Milvus milvus). Appropriate assessment tools for these effects have been lacking. To close this gap, we have developed an agent-based, spatially explicit model that simulates the foraging behavior of the Red Kite around its aerie in a landscape consisting of different land-use types. We determined the collision risk of the Red Kite with the turbine as a function of the distance between the wind turbine and the aerie and other parameters. The impact function comprises the synergistic effects of species-specific foraging behavior and landscape structure. The collision risk declines exponentially with increasing distance. The strength of this decline depends on the raptor's foraging behavior, its ability to avoid wind turbines, and the mean wind speed in the region. The collision risks, which are estimated by the simulation model, are in the range of values observed in the field. The derived impact function shows that the collision risk can be described as an aggregated function of distance between the wind turbine and the raptor's aerie. This allows an easy and rapid assessment of the ecological impacts of (existing or planned) wind turbines in relation to their spatial location. Furthermore, it implies that minimum buffer zones for different landscapes can be determined in a defensible way. This modeling approach can be extended to other bird species with central-place foraging behavior. It provides a helpful tool for landscape planning aimed at minimizing the impacts of wind power on biodiversity.

In Europe, the recolonization of large carnivores often occurs in areas where humans have greatly modified the landscape through forestry or agriculture. Currently, we poorly understand the effects of recolonizing large carnivores on extant prey species in anthropogenic landscapes. Here, we investigated if ungulate prey species showed innate responses to the scent of a regionally exterminated but native large carnivore, and whether the responses were affected by human-induced habitat openness. We experimentally introduced brown bear Ursus arctos scent to artificial feeding sites and used camera traps to document the responses of three sympatric ungulate species. In addition to controls without scent, reindeer scent Rangifer tarandus was used as a noncarnivore, novel control scent. Fallow deer Dama dama strongly avoided areas with bear scent. In the presence of bear scent, all ungulate species generally used open sites more than closed sites, whereas the opposite was observed at sites with reindeer scent or without scent. The opening of forest habitat by human practices, such as forestry and agriculture, creates a larger gradient in habitat openness than available in relatively unaffected closed forest systems, which may create opportunities for prey to alter their habitat selection and reduce predation risk in human-modified systems that do not exist in more natural forest systems. Increased knowledge about antipredator responses in areas subjected to anthropogenic change is important because these responses may affect prey population dynamics, lower trophic levels, and attitudes toward large carnivores. These aspects may be of particular relevance in the light of the increasing wildlife populations across much of Europe.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  15     Total Times Cited:  15     Cited Reference Count:  55 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1002/ece3.1866     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Anthropogenic change;antipredator response;brown bear;landscape of fear;predator-prey interactions;prey naivety;ungulates;YELLOWSTONE-NATIONAL-PARK;PREDATION RISK;BEHAVIORAL-RESPONSES;VIGILANCE BEHAVIOR;HABITAT SELECTION;PREY;BEAR;DEER;FEAR;LANDSCAPE,,

Visual cues are important as they allow prey to assess predator species, size, proximity and behaviour. However, few studies have explicitly examined prey's ability to assess risk based on predator behaviour and orientation. Using mosquitofish, Gambusia holbrooki, and their predator, jade perch, Scortum barcoo, under controlled conditions, we provide some of the first fine-scale characterization of how prey adapt their behaviour according to their continuous assessment of risk based on both predator behaviour and angular distance to the predator's mouth. When these predators were inactive and posed less of an immediate threat, prey within the attack cone of the predator showed reductions in speed and acceleration characteristic of predator-inspection behaviour. However, when predators became active, prey swam faster with greater acceleration and were closer together within the attack cone of predators. Most importantly, this study provides evidence that prey do not adopt a uniform response to the presence of a predator. Instead, we demonstrate that prey are capable of rapidly and dynamically updating their assessment of risk and showing fine-scale adjustments to their behaviour.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  6     Total Times Cited:  6     Cited Reference Count:  82 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1098/rspb.2019.0448     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),predator-prey interactions;collective behaviour;risk sensitivity;attack cone;fountain effect;PREDATOR INSPECTION BEHAVIOR;ATTACK CONE AVOIDANCE;CHARACIN FISH;ANTIPREDATOR BEHAVIOR;FACE RECOGNITION;HIDING BEHAVIOR;SELFISH HERD;VISUAL CUES;SHOAL SIZE;DIET CUES,,

Because the life cycle of prey species is memory, the fractional calculus equation is considered to study the dynamic behavior of the proposed system. The sufficient conditions to ensure the existence and uniqueness of the system solution are found, and the legitimacy and well posedness in the biological sense of the system solution, such as nonnegativity and boundedness, are proved. The stability of all equilibrium points of the system is analyzed by an eigenvalue analysis method, and it is proved that the system generates Hopf bifurcation nearby the coexistence equilibrium with regard to three parameters: the fear coefficient k, the rate of prey shelters p, and the order of fractional derivative q. Compared with the integer derivative, the system dynamics in the situation of fractional derivative is more stable. We observe an interesting phenomenon through the simulation: with the increase in the level of the fear effect, the stability of the positive equilibrium point changes from stable to unstable and then to stable. At this time, there are two Hopf branches nearby the positive equilibrium point with respect to the fear coefficient k, and the system can be in a stable state at very low or high level of the fear effect. In addition, when the order of the fractional differential equation of the system decreases continuously, the stability of the system will change from unstable to stable, especially in the case of low-level fear caused by predators and low rate of prey shelters. Therefore, our findings support the view that the strong memory can promote the stable coexistence of two species in the prey-predator system, while fading memory of species will worsen the stable coexistence of two species in the proposed system.& nbsp;& nbsp;Published under an exclusive license by AIP Publishing.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  55 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Included""}",10.1063/5.0082733     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),MUTUAL INTERFERENCE;GLOBAL EXISTENCE;MODEL;DYNAMICS;BIFURCATION;STABILITY;BEHAVIOR;DENSITY;IMPACT;FOOD;Prednisolone;Fear,,

Across Europe, ungulate populations are leading to intensified human-wildlife conflicts. At the same time, ungulates play a vital role in the structuring and functioning of ecosystems, and are highly appreciated for recreational hunting. Thus, managers often face the challenge of maintaining the benefits of having thriving ungulate populations while simultaneously minimizing their negative impacts. Broadcasting playbacks of predator vocalizations (e.g. dogs barking, wolves howling or humans talking) could potentially be used to induce fear and thereby displace or steer behavior of ungulates from conflict-prone sites resulting in reduced visitation and foraging time and consumption. Predator playback experiments in wilderness areas have repeatedly demonstrated to reduce the preys ' resource use and impacts on the surrounding landscape, but this has not been tested in agricultural fields where human-ungulate conflicts are most pronounced. We responded to this need by conducting a predator playback experiment in multiple crop fields in southern Sweden, where multiple ungulate species (fallow deer, roe deer, red deer, moose, wild boar) coexist, using a novel integrated camera trap - speaker system (ABRs) that broadcasts sounds of choice when a camera is triggered by an ungulate. Predator playbacks (wolf, dog, human) reduced deer patch use and crop damage on wheat fields more than playbacks of control sounds (owl, goose, raven). Our results confirm findings from previous studies in wilderness areas, and demonstrate that broadcasting predator playbacks using ABRs may provide an effective tool to reduce crop damage at the scale and duration of our study.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  1     Total Times Cited:  1     Cited Reference Count:  58 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.agee.2022.107853     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Crop damage;Landscape of fear;Ungulate management;Predator-induced fear;Playback experiment;HOME-RANGE SIZE;RISK;FEAR;ECOLOGY;MANAGEMENT;RESPONSES;PATTERNS;LIONS;Prednisolone,,

Using some recent advances in evolutionary game theory, we extend the classical ideal free distribution (IFD) concept for single species to two interacting species. We study population dynamical consequences of two-species IFD by comparing two systems: one where individuals cannot migrate between habitats and one where migration is possible. For single species, predator-prey interactions, and competing species, we show that these two types of behavior lead to the same population equilibria and corresponding species spatial distributions, provided interspecific competition is patch independent. However, if differences between patches are such that competition is patch dependent, then our predictions strongly depend on whether animals can migrate or not. In particular, we show that when species are settled at their equilibrium population densities in both habitats in the environment where migration between habitats is blocked, then the corresponding species spatial distribution need not be an IFD. Thus, when species are given the opportunity to migrate, they will redistribute to reach an IFD (e.g., under which the two species can completely segregate), and this redistribution will also influence species population equilibrial densities. Alternatively, we also show that when two species are distributed according to the IFD, the corresponding population equilibrium can be unstable.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  91     Total Times Cited:  94     Cited Reference Count:  42 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1086/423827     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),adaptive foraging;competition;evolutionarily stable strategy;habitat choice;ideal free distribution;predator-prey;replicator system;DEPENDENT HABITAT SELECTION;PREDATION RISK;COEXISTENCE;COMPETITION;STRATEGIES;ISOCLINE;BEHAVIOR;GHOST;SHAPE;FOOD;Population Dynamics,,

It is triggered through the olfactory system by substances released from injured skin and is characterized by dramatic, measurable changes in locomotion as well as physiology. We propose that this is an ideal time to revisit this response and to utilize it as an assay for understanding how neural circuits mediate innate fear. A suitable organism for these studies is the zebrafish, a genetic model with a rapidly expanding toolkit for molecular manipulation of the nervous system. Individual neurons mediating the response, ranging from receptor neurons to those in higher brain centers, should first be identified. New tools, specifically transgenic lines that allow spatial and temporal control of neural activity, provide a way to define and test the role of specific neurons, while genetic screens provide a route to identifying individual molecules essential for a normal response. Optical recording, which has proven successful in studies of information processing in the bulb, will provide valuable insights into neural circuitry function during the alarm response. When carried out on mutants, physiological analysis can provide insight into aspects of signal processing that are essential for normal behavior. The alarm response thus provides a paradigm to examine innate fear in a vertebrate system, enabling analysis at multiple levels from genes to the entire neural circuit. Additionally, the context dependency of the response can be utilized to investigate attention and decision making.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  63     Total Times Cited:  63     Cited Reference Count:  80 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1080/01677060802298475     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Schreckstoff;anxiety;olfactory;anti-predator;Ostariophysan;semiochemical;OLFACTORY SENSORY NEURONS;FATHEAD MINNOWS;SUBSTANCE CELLS;CRUCIAN CARP;PIMEPHALES-PROMELAS;BEHAVIORAL-RESPONSE;PHOXINUS-PHOXINUS;SKIN EXTRACT;CYPRINIDAE;BULB,,

Various Turing patterns are presented and found that the change in the level of fear and diffusion coefficients alter these structures significantly.

Many prey run to hide in refuges in their habitat, whereas others are sessile and take refuge in a protective structure surrounding their body. An intermediate situation is when animals, such as turtles, have morphological structures that provide some partial protection, but they are also able to escape actively to safer refuges. This might complicate hiding decisions predicted by the theory of optimal-refuge use. We studied antipredatory tactics of Spanish terrapins (Mauremys leprosa) in response to simulated predatory attacks with different characteristics (i.e. combinations of several risk factors) and under different conditions (i.e. proximity to safe refuges), which should contribute to overall risk-level estimation. We specifically examined how risk level affected time spent withdrawn into the shell and time until turtles switched to an active escape tactic. The results showed that turtles were able to adjust their hiding behavior by assessing the risk of emerging before the predator had left the area. However, increasing hiding time may also increase the risk that the predator was able to injure or kill the turtle. Thus, the possibility of switching the antipredatory tactic to an alternative active escape to safer refuges (i.e. water) also influenced hiding times.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  28     Total Times Cited:  30     Cited Reference Count:  31 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s00265-004-0887-1     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),hiding behavior;refuge use;predation risk;Mauremys leprosa;turtles;PREDATORY ATTACKS;EUMECES LATICEPS;ALPINE LIZARD;REFUGE USE;BEHAVIOR;ANTIPREDATOR;PREY;THREAT;LARVAE;GAME,,

Different experimental shreds of evidence validate that the presence of the predator strongly affects the physiological behaviour of prey individuals and dramatically reduces their reproduction rate. In this study, we investigate the interplay between the level of fear and the degree of habitat complexity in a predator-prey model with two different shaped functional responses. We, therefore, develop the functional response using the timescale separation method, and the shape of the resulting functional response depends upon the monotonous property of catch rate, g(N) where N is the prey biomass. Whenever g(N) increases strictly, a saturating functional response occurs, but for nonmonotonic g(N), a dome-shaped functional response arises. For saturating case, it has been revealed that both prey and predator biomass may oscillate for lower levels of fear and a lower degree of habitat complexity. To stabilize this oscillatory behaviour to a coexistence state, we have to adequately increase the level of fear or degree of habitat complexity. However, for dome-shaped case, more complicated dynamics are observed. In this case, coexistence steady state, if exists, may be locally asymptotically stable for a lower degree of habitat complexity, but for intermediate values, the system is capable of producing multiple coexistence steady states with a bistable phenomenon between predator-free steady state and a coexistence steady state. Moreover, if the level of fear is sufficiently low, the system may experience a supercritical or/and subcritical Hopf bifurcation. In the dynamics of parametric disturbance for the degree of habitat complexity parameter, dome-shaped functional response predicts that disturbance may trap the system into a nearest attractor (either a large amplitude stable limit cycle or predator-free steady state); this can be overcome only by a larger alteration, or sometimes it is impossible to overcome (hysteresis phenomena), whereas the saturating-shaped functional response predicts a system resilience. For both the functional responses, a higher degree of habitat complexity always increases the extinction possibility of the predator, and no level of fear can compensate this biodiversity loss.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  1     Total Times Cited:  1     Cited Reference Count:  43 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Included""}",10.1155/2021/6427864     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),STRUCTURAL SENSITIVITY;SPECIES-DIVERSITY;MODEL;Prednisolone,,

These nonlethal effects can influence food web properties as much as lethal effects. The mechanisms of nonlethal effects include chronic and temporary anti-predator behaviours, the nature of which depends on the spatial dynamics of predators and the range over which prey perceive risk. The relation between chronic and ephemeral responses to risk determines predator-prey interactions, with consequences that can ripple across the food web. Nonetheless, few studies have quantified the spatio-temporal scales over which prey respond to predation threat, and how this response varies with habitat features. We evaluated the reaction of radio-collared caribou and moose to the passage of radio-collared wolves, by considering changes in movement characteristics during winter and summer. We used an optimization algorithm to identify the rate at which the impact of prior passage of wolves decreases over time and with the predator's distance. The spatial and temporal scales of anti-predator responses varied with prey species and season. Caribou and moose displayed four types of behaviour following the passage of wolves: lack of response, increased selection of safe land cover types, decreased selection of risky cover types and increased selection of food-rich forest stands. For example, moose increased their avoidance of open conifer stands with lichen in summer, which are selected by wolves in this season. Also in winter, caribou increased their selection of conifer stands with lichen for nearly 10days following a wolf's passage. This stronger selection for food-rich patches could indicate that the recent passage of wolves informs caribou on the current predator distribution and reveals the rate at which this information become less reliable over time. Caribou and moose used anti-predator responses that combine both long- and short-term behavioural adjustments. The spatial game between wolves and their prey involves complex and nonlinear mechanisms that vary between species and seasons. A comprehensive assessment of risk effects on ecosystem dynamics thus requires the characterization of chronic and temporary anti-predator behaviours.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  80     Total Times Cited:  80     Cited Reference Count:  55 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/1365-2656.12108     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),behavioural response race;ecology of fear;GPS;habitat selection;predation;predator-prey spatial game;space race;step selection functions;PREDATOR INSPECTION BEHAVIOR;HABITAT SELECTION;ANTIPREDATOR RESPONSE;ALCES-ALCES;SPACE USE;RISK;PREY;WOLVES;ELK;VIGILANCE,,

It is largely ignored, however, as an evolutionary driver of social complexity and cooperative breeding, which is attributed mainly to a combination of habitat saturation and enhanced relatedness levels. Social cichlids neither suffer from habitat saturation, nor are their groups composed primarily of relatives. This demands alternative ecological explanations for the evolution of advanced social organization. To address this question, we compared the ecology of eight populations of Neolamprologus pulcher, a cichlid fish arguably representing the pinnacle of social evolution in poikilothermic vertebrates. Results show that variation in social organization and behavior of these fish is primarily explained by predation risk and related ecological factors. Remarkably, ecology affects group structure more strongly than group size, with predation inversely affecting small and large group members. High predation and shelter limitation leads to groups containing few small but many large members, which is an effect enhanced at low population densities. Apparently, enhanced safety from predators by cooperative defense and shelter construction are the primary benefits of sociality. This finding suggests that predation risk can be fundamental for the transition toward complex social organization, which is generally undervalued.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  76     Total Times Cited:  77     Cited Reference Count:  61 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1073/pnas.1524178113     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),social evolution;social complexity;predation risk;ecological constraints;cooperative breeding;NEOLAMPROLOGUS-PULCHER PISCES;CICHLID FISH;HELPING-BEHAVIOR;COMMUNICATIVE COMPLEXITY;BROODCARE HELPERS;GROUP-SIZE;DISPERSAL;EVOLUTION;RELATEDNESS;FIELD;Prednisolone,,

Furthermore, dilution and detection effects change depending on when during an attack the predator targets a particular prey individual for pursuit. Realistic detection and dilution effects probably interact with each other and also with the targeting behaviour of predators. Instead of considering detection and dilution effects on vigilance, it may be more profitable to consider each prey's probability of being targeted during an attack and its probability of escaping if attacked.

Information theory predicts that high certainty cues should be valued more than low certainty cues. We measured the latency of black-capped chickadees (Poecile atricapillus) to resume feeding during winter in response to cues that conferred different degrees of certainty about current predation risk: a high certainty visual cue (predator mount) and a lower certainty acoustic cue (conspecific mobbing calls), presented either alone or in combination. As predicted, chickadees took longer to resume feeding after the visual than the acoustic cue, and this effect was greatest under conditions of high starvation risk (i.e. low temperatures). Presenting both cues together produced the same foraging delay as the visual cue alone under low starvation risk, but surprisingly, resulted in lower responses under high starvation risk compared to the visual cue alone. We suggest that this may be due to prey using a form of information updating, whereby differences in the timing of perception of acoustic versus visual cues interacts with energetic constraint to shape perceived risk.

In predator-ungulate-plant systems, empirical research quantifying how predators affect ungulate group sizes and distribution, in the context of other influential variables, is particularly needed. The risk allocation hypothesis proposes that prey behavioral responses to predation risk depend on background frequencies of exposure to risk, and it can be used to make predictions about predator-ungulate-plant interactions. We determined non-predation variables that affect elk (Cervus elaphus) group sizes and distribution on a winter range in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE) using logistic and log-linear regression on surveys of 513 1-km(2) areas conducted over two years. Employing model selection techniques, we evaluated risk allocation and other a priori hypotheses of elk group size and distributional responses to wolf (Canis lupus) predation risk while accounting for influential non-wolf-predation variables. We found little evidence that wolves affect elk group sizes, which were strongly influenced by habitat type and hunting by humans. Following predictions from the risk allocation hypothesis, wolves likely created a more dynamic elk distribution in areas that they frequently hunted, as elk tended to move following wolf encounters in those areas. This response should dilute elk foraging pressure on plant communities in areas where they are frequently hunted by wolves. We predict that this should decrease the spatial heterogeneity of elk impacts on grasslands in areas that wolves frequently hunt. We also predict that this should decrease browsing pressure on heavily browsed woody plant stands in certain areas, which is supported by recent research in the GYE.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  76     Total Times Cited:  77     Cited Reference Count:  45 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1890/04-0623     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),behavioral interactions;elk;Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem;indirect effects;model selection;predator-prey;risk allocation;trait-mediated indirect interactions;trophic cascade;wolf;YELLOWSTONE-NATIONAL-PARK;TROPHIC CASCADES;TEMPORAL VARIATION;PREDATION RISK;ANTIPREDATOR BEHAVIOR;FEEDING-BEHAVIOR;ELK;WOLVES;RESPONSES;MOVEMENTS,,

The value of energy for the prey changes depending on season. Prey in a low energetic state and/or in a reproductive state should invest more in foraging and tolerate higher predation risk. This should make the prey more catchable, and thereby, more preferable to predators. We ask, can predators respond to prey state? How does season and state affect the foraging game from the predator's perspective? By letting owls choose between gerbils whose states we experimentally manipulated, we could demonstrate predator sensitivity to prey state and predator selectivity that otherwise may be obscured by the foraging game. During spring, owls invested more time and attacks in the patch with well-fed gerbils. During summer, owls attacked both patches equally, yet allocated more time to the patch with hungry gerbils. Energetic state per se does not seem to be the basis of owl choice. The owls strongly responded to these subtle differences. In summer, gerbils managed their behavior primarily for survival, and the owls equalized capture opportunities by attacking both patches equally.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  11     Total Times Cited:  11     Cited Reference Count:  26 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1890/13-0836.1     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Allenby's gerbil;Gerbillus andersoni allenbyi;Barn Owls;Tyto alba;coexistence;community ecology;foraging game;predator-prey interactions;PATCH USE;HABITAT SELECTION;TIME ALLOCATION;FORAGING BEHAVIOR;RISK;APPREHENSION;VIGILANCE;GAMES;RODENTS;ECOLOGY;Gerbillinae;Prednisolone,,

Winter season represents an especially challenging time of year for this Holarctic species as it is characterized by a shortage of basic resources and is when most industrial development occurs, to which caribou can perceive as increased predation risk. To investigate the impact of industrial features on caribou, we developed a spatially explicit, agent-based model (ABM) to simulate the underlying behavioral mechanisms caribou are most likely to employ when navigating their landscape in winter. The ABM model is composed of cognitive caribou agents possessing memory and decision-making heuristics that act to optimize tradeoffs between energy acquisition and predator/disturbance avoidance. A set of environmental data layers was used to develop a virtual grid representing the landscape in terms of forage availability, energy content, and predation-risk. The model was calibrated with caribou bio-energetic values from literature sources, and validated using GPS data from thirteen caribou radio-collars deployed over 6 months from 2004 to 2005. Simulations were conducted on alternative caribou habitat-selection strategies by assigning different fitness-maximizing goals to agents. The model outcomes were evaluated using a pattern-oriented modeling approach with actual caribou data. The scenario in which the caribou agent must trade off the mutually competing goals of obtaining its daily energy requirement, conserving reproductive energy, and minimizing predation risk, was found to be the best-fit scenario. Not recognizing industrial features as risk causes simulated caribou to unrealistically reduce their daily and landscape movements: equally, having risk take precedence results in unrealistic energetic deficits and large-scale movement patterns, unlike those observed in actual caribou. These results elucidate the most likely behavioral strategies caribou use to select their winter habitat, the relative extent to which they perceive industry features as potential predation, and the differential energetic costs associated with each strategy. They can assist future studies of how caribou may respond to continued industrial development and/or mitigation measures. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Teals forage mostly with only the bill submerged (eyes above the water surface) in winter, but use a broader foraging repertoire in summer. Given the different environments used by teals over the year, it is likely that such a shift is due to changes in diet, but it may also be caused by differences in predation risk between habitats. However, neither predation risk nor teal behaviour has been studied with consistent methods around the year or throughout any of its flyways. Covering wintering, spring-staging, breeding and moulting sites, we combined focal observations of teals and predator flyover data from seven regions ranging from southern France to northern Sweden. Although not apparent at the scale of days within sites, teals indeed relied more on shallow foraging where predation risk was higher, i.e. at wintering sites. Average foraging depth increased gradually from September to August, i.e. from wintering to breeding sites. Foraging bout length of deeply foraging teals did not decrease over the year, suggesting that it is through selection of foraging technique, rather than by the balance between foraging and interruptions, that birds adjust to predation risk. This study highlights behavioural plasticity in response to contrasting selection regimes within a flyway, in dabbling ducks as well as long-distance migrants in general.

However, these behavioural modifications can have long term costs. There is therefore a trade-off between antipredator behaviours and other activities. This trade-off is generally considered between vigilance and only one other behaviour, thus neglecting potential compensations. In this study, we considered the effect of an increase in predation risk on the diurnal time-budget of three captive duck species during the wintering period. We artificially increased predation risk by disturbing two groups of 14 mallard and teals at different frequencies, and one group of 14 tufted ducks with a radio-controlled stressor. We recorded foraging, vigilance, preening and sleeping durations the week before, during and after disturbance sessions. Disturbed groups were compared to an undisturbed control group. We showed that in all three species, the increase in predation risk resulted in a decrease in foraging and preening and led to an increase in sleeping. It is worth noting that contrary to common observations, vigilance did not increase. However, ducks are known to be vigilant while sleeping. This complex behavioural adjustment therefore seems to be optimal as it may allow ducks to reduce their predation risk. Our results highlight the fact that it is necessary to encompass the whole individual time-budget when studying behavioural modifications under predation risk. Finally, we propose that studies of behavioural time-budget changes under predation risk should be included in the more general framework of the starvation-predation risk trade-off.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  11     Total Times Cited:  13     Cited Reference Count:  62 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1371/journal.pone.0018977     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),VIGILANCE TRADE-OFF;ANAS-CRECCA-CRECCA;ALLOCATION HYPOTHESIS;TEMPORAL VARIATION;FOOD AVAILABILITY;FORAGING ACTIVITY;BODY-MASS;SLEEP;BIRDS;MORTALITY;Prednisolone,,

Although extensive research has explored how various aspects of mating systems affect this allocation, male allocation between mating, fertilization and parental effort has not previously been considered. Yet, paternal care can be energetically expensive and males are generally predicted to adjust their parental effort in response to expected paternity. Here, we incorporate parental effort into sperm competition games, particularly exploring how the relationship between paternal care and offspring survival affects sperm competition and the relationship between paternity and paternal care. Our results support existing expectations that (i) fertilization effort should increase with female promiscuity and (ii) paternal care should increase with expected paternity. However, our analyses also reveal that the cost of male care can drive the strength of these patterns. When paternal behaviour is energetically costly, increased allocation to parental effort constrains allocation to fertilization effort. As paternal care becomes less costly, the association between paternity and paternal care weakens and may even be absent. By explicitly considering variation in sperm competition and the cost of male care, our model provides an integrative framework for predicting the interaction between paternal care and patterns of paternity.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  12     Total Times Cited:  12     Cited Reference Count:  65 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1098/rspb.2017.1266     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),offspring survival;parental investment;paternity;polyandry;sexual selection;MALE PARENTAL CARE;SEXUAL SELECTION;TESTIS SIZE;PREDATION RISK;LIFE-HISTORY;EVOLUTION;COST;PATTERNS;FEMALES;SUCCESS;Paternalism;Paternity,,

Concealed birds sang more and were less vigilant. Vigilance increased as distance to the forested edge increased, but distance had no effect on time allocated to singing. Body size was significantly correlated with vigilance but not singing; larger passerines were more sensitive to both relative concealment and the distance to the forest edge, while song was influenced by neither of these factors.

The nonconsumptive effects of rabbit hunting on Northern Bobwhite (Colinus virginianus; hereafter, bobwhite) are currently unknown. Increased perceived risk of predation by bobwhite during rabbit hunting events may elicit antipredator responses among bobwhite that impact fitness via changes in behavior that ultimately impact population growth. We estimated the nonconsumptive effects of rabbit hunting on bobwhite behavior using telemetry across varying rabbit hunting intensities. Movements were analyzed using Bayesian hierarchical modeling with a before-after-control-impact (BACI) design to determine the effect of rabbit hunting on bobwhite. We observed an overall reduction in bobwhite movement in the presence of rabbit hunting, with a 38% (Posterior Overlap = 0.01) increase in bobwhite step length in the absence of rabbit hunting. We also observed bobwhite maintaining closer proximity to hardwood and escape cover under high rabbit hunting intensity, with a 59% (Posterior Overlap = 0.03) increase in distance from hardwood and a 28% (Posterior Overlap = 0.14) increase in distance from escape cover when rabbit hunting was removed. Synthesis and applications. Heightened antipredator behavior through decreased movement may assist with bobwhite predator avoidance. However, decreased movement and increased use of poor habitats may also have negative effects as a result of reduced foraging time or increased susceptibility to other predators. Future research should attempt to quantify the effect of decreased movement on bobwhite fitness through the evaluation of foraging time and survival in order to continue to improve management efforts for the species.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  1     Total Times Cited:  1     Cited Reference Count:  69 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1002/ece3.5479     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),antipredator behavior;before-after-control-impact design;hunting;nonconsumptive effects;Northern Bobwhite;protean behavior;risky space;threat sensitivity;PREDATOR AVOIDANCE;ANTIPREDATOR RESPONSE;RISK;PREY;FEAR;BEHAVIOR;HABITAT;MANAGEMENT;CONSERVATION;COMPETITION,,

The use of protected areas, as islands of conservation, has limits to the extent of biodiversity conservation due to isolation and scale. As a result, there is a push to transition from solely developing protected areas to policies that also support corridor management. Given the complexities of multi-species interaction on a fragmented landscape, managers need additional tools to aid in decision-making and policy development. We develop an agent-based model (ABM) of a two-patch metapopulation with local predator-prey dynamics and variable, density-dependent species dispersal. The goal is to assess how connectivity between patches, given a variety of dispersal schema for the targeted interacting populations, promotes coexistence among predators and prey. The experiment conducted suggests that connectivity levels at both extremes, representing very little risk and high risk of species mortality, do not augment the likelihood of coexistence while intermediate levels do. Furthermore, the probability of coexistence increases and spans a wide range of connectivity levels when movement is less probabilistic and more dependent on population feedback. Knowledge of these connectivity tradeoffs is essential for assessing the value of habitat corridors, and can be further elucidated under the agent-based framework. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The probability of occurrence of porpoises was highest on an offshore sandbank, where the proportion of detections with foraging clicks was relatively low. The porpoises' overall distribution shifted throughout the summer and autumn, likely influenced by seasonal prey availability. Probability of porpoise occurrence was lowest in areas close to the coast, where dolphin detections were highest and declined prior to dolphin detection, leading potentially to avoidance of spatiotemporal overlap between porpoises and dolphins. Increased understanding of porpoises' seasonal distribution, key foraging areas, and their relationship with competitors can shed light on management options and potential interactions with offshore industries.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  1     Total Times Cited:  1     Cited Reference Count:  68 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/mms.12839     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),bottlenose dolphin;competition;C-POD;distribution;foraging;harbor porpoise;INLA;landscape of fear;BOTTLE-NOSED DOLPHINS;PHOCOENA-PHOCOENA;HABITAT PREFERENCES;TURSIOPS-TRUNCATUS;VIOLENT INTERACTIONS;LESSER SANDEEL;CARDIGAN BAY;NORTH-SEA;ECHOLOCATION;MODELS,,

Here, we explore how behavioral modification in prey species due to fear of predator and mutual interference between predators can create different spatiotemporal patterns in population distribution. We show that the fear factor and diffusion in a ratio-dependent predator-prey model may show more complex dynamics than observed earlier. It is shown that when prey diffusivity is low, prey remains concentrated at different patches throughout the domain. However, prey density becomes low at the patches as they disperse at a higher rate. Mixed and stripe patterns are observed during the transition from a hot spot pattern at the lower prey diffusivity to a cold spot pattern at its higher value. Pattern transition is, however, completely opposite if the antipredator behavior is gradually increased. Our simulation results reveal that the spatiotemporal chaotic pattern may also be observed in the Hopf-Turing region of instability provided prey shows a higher level of antipredator behavior. The chaotic pattern of the Hopf-Turing region may be shifted to a spot type pattern of the Turing region depending on the refuge level of the habitat.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  3     Total Times Cited:  3     Cited Reference Count:  39 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Included""}",10.1063/5.0035130     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Prednisolone,,

In this work, we have described a predator-prey model with Holling type II functional response incorporating prey refuge. Irrespective of being considering either a constant number of prey being refuged or a proportion of the prey population being refuged, a different growth rate and different carrying capacity for the prey population in the refuge area are considered. The total prey population is divided into two subclasses: (i) prey x in the refuge area and (ii) prey y in the predatory area. We have taken the migration of the prey population from refuge area to predatory area. Also, we have considered a benefit from the antipredation response of the prey population y in presence of cost of fear. Feasible equilibrium points of the proposed system are derived, and the dynamical behavior of the system around equilibria is investigated. Birth rate of prey in predatory region has been regarded as bifurcation parameter to examine the occurrence of Hopf bifurcation in the neighborhood of the interior equilibrium point. Moreover, the conditions for occurrence of transcritical bifurcations have been determined. Further, we have incorporated discrete-type gestational delay on the system to make it more realistic. The dynamical behavior of the delayed system is analyzed.

Many group-living species, however, spend a portion of their life cycle as dispersed individuals, suggesting that the costs and benefits of these opposing behaviors vary temporally. Here, we evaluated mechanistic hypotheses for explaining individual dispersion as a tactic for reducing predation risk at reproduction (i.e., birthing) in an otherwise group-living animal. Using simulation analyses parameterized by empirical data, we assessed whether dispersion increases reproductive success by (i) increasing predator search time, (ii) reducing predator encounter rates because individuals are inconspicuous relative to groups, or (iii) eliminating the risk of multiple kills per encounter. Simulations indicate that dispersion becomes favorable only when detectability increases with group size and there is risk of multiple kills per encounter. This latter effect, however, is likely the primary mechanism driving females to disperse at reproduction because group detectability effects are presumably constant year-round. We suggest that the risk of multiple kills imposed by highly vulnerable offspring may be an important factor influencing dispersive behavior in many species, and conservation strategies for such species will require protecting sufficient space to allow dispersion to effectively reduce predation risk.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  8     Total Times Cited:  8     Cited Reference Count:  58 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1086/685856     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),group living;dispersion;predation risk;multiple kills;reproductive behavior;spacing out;GROUP-SIZE;WOODLAND CARIBOU;HABITAT;VULNERABILITY;AGGREGATION;WOLVES;FISH;ELK;Prednisolone,,

One established function is to acknowledge existing dominance relationships. At the same time, call rates often increase during social tension, suggesting additional functions, such as to appease higher-ranking individuals, or to maintain spatial proximity and friendly relations. For vervet monkeys, Chlorocebus pygerythrus, vocal behaviour has been studied extensively, but little research has been devoted to calls given during encounters between two individuals, i.e. grunts. Here, we examined how individual and relationship features affected the vocal greeting behaviour of wild vervet monkeys in different ecological and social situations. We used an information theory approach to investigate the functional hypotheses of vervet monkeys' vocal greeting signals. We found little support for the main functions proposed in the literature, that is, to signal submission, to avoid conflicts, to test social bonds or to coordinate group activity. Results supported the use of grunts to signal benign intent, and we found that grunts were mostly given to closely bonded males near rivers, suggesting that vervet monkeys use vocal greeting signals to recruit individuals in situations of danger to reduce predation risk.

The conspicuous behavior is considered to be an antipredator signal, and the frequency of signaling individuals in a population differs between males and females in many species. We theoretically assessed the evolution of the inter- and intrasexual dimorphism in antipredator signaling by developing an evolutionary game model. We particularly focused on the Chinese grasshopper, Acrida cinerea, in which only a proportion of males and no females escape conspicuously. In our model, the antipredator signal was assumed to be costly and affect the probabilities of predation of both the signaling individual (individual effect) and the signaling or nonsignaling conspecifics around it (collective effect). The model indicates that (1) a positive individual effect is essential for the evolution of antipredator signaling; (2) sexual dimorphism in fecundity cost for signaling individuals or natural predation probability can produce intersexual dimorphism in the signaling where all individuals of one sex and no individuals of the other sex emit signal; and (3) a positive collective effect can explain the intrasexual dimorphism where only some individuals of one sex signal. This study provides the first model of intrasexual dimorphism in antipredator signaling and brings new testable predictions.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  1     Total Times Cited:  1     Cited Reference Count:  58 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1086/715745     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),crepitation;escape strategy;evolutionary dynamics;grasshopper;intrasexual dimorphism;MALE PARENTAL CARE;PREDATION RISK;ALARM CALLS;BODY-SIZE;BEHAVIOR;ORTHOPTERA;SELECTION;NEPOTISM,,

In this paper, we have extended our previous work spatiotemporal dynamics of predator-prey interactions with fear effect by introducing the cross-diffusion. The conditions for cross-diffusion-driven instability are obtained using the linear stability analysis. The standard multiple scale analysis is used to derive the amplitude equations for the excited modes near Turing bifurcation threshold by taking the cross-diffusion coefficient as a bifurcation parameter. From the stability analysis of amplitude equations, the conditions for the emergence of various ecologically realistic Turing patterns such as spot, stripe, and mixture of spots and stripes are identified. Analytical results are verified with the help of numerical simulations. Turing bifurcation diagrams are plotted taking diffusion coefficients as control parameters. The effect of the cross-diffusion coefficients on the homogeneous steady state and pattern structures of the self-diffusive model is illustrated using the simulation techniques. It is also observed that the level of fear has stabilizing effect on the cross-diffusion induced instability and spot patterns change to stripe, then a mixture of spots and stripes and finally to the labyrinthine type of patterns with an increase in the level of fear.

It has raised considerable interest both from a theoretical perspective and because of its importance in population dynamics in natural ecosystems. It could also play an important role from an applied perspective, especially when using predatory species in biological control programmes. The present paper aims to study the cannibalistic behaviour of Nabis pseudoferus Remane and the functional response of adult females. In a non-choice experiment, adult females showed clear acceptance of immature conspecifics as prey, with relatively high mortality values (51.89 +/- 2.69%). These values were lower than those occurring for heterospecific prey, Spodoptera exigua Hubner, under the same conditions (80.00 +/- 2.82%). However, the main result was that the rate of predation on heterospecific prey was reduced to 59.09 +/- 7.08% in the presence of conspecific prey. The prey-capture behaviour of adult females differed when they hunted conspecific versus heterospecific prey. This was shown in the average handling time, which was 23.3 +/- 3.3 min in the first case (conspecific) versus 16.6 +/- 2.5 min in the second (heterospecific). Furthermore, the values increased in the former case and declined in the latter according to the order in which the prey were captured. The difference in handling time was not significant when adjusting the adult female functional response to conspecific nymphs. We argue that these results likely indicate risk aversion and a fear of reprisal among conspecifics.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  5     Total Times Cited:  6     Cited Reference Count:  63 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1556/168.2017.18.1.10     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Functional response;Heterospecific and conspecific prey;Insect;Nabis pseudoferus;Predatory behaviour;Prey-predator relationship;Spodoptera exigua;PACIFIC DAMSEL BUG;FUNCTIONAL-RESPONSE;LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS;BIOLOGICAL-CONTROL;INSECT PREDATION;PREY;CONSUMPTION;GENERALIST;HEMIPTERA;FREQUENCY;Cannibalism,,

Pheasant hunters used direct and indirect information about the availability and accessibility of pheasants to make spatial decisions throughout their hunts, but the sources of information used at the beginning of hunts differed from those used for the duration of hunts. Hunter access point effort at the start of hunts was positively associated with proximity to public access signs and declined near marked safety zones around occupied structures and livestock, indicating that hunters responded to the spatial distribution and information content of public access infrastructure. Hunter effort within fields for the duration of hunts was positively related to predicted pheasant habitat use and negatively associated with correlates of physical exertion and increasing distance from field edges. Our findings indicate that hunters in the field are making spatial decisions in response to information about public land access, their own physical state, and perceived opportunity to encounter pheasants.

My results supported the hypothesis that low macrozooplankton density leads to dispersion of juvenile salmon from shallow nearshore habitats and greater predation risk, but zooplankton type was an important factor. When the biomass of large copepods (primarily Neocalanus spp.) declined, salmon dispersed from shallow nearshore habitats, and mean daily individual predator consumption of salmon increased by a factor of 5. A concomitant five-fold increase in the probability of occurrence of salmon in predator stomachs supported the notion that increased predation on salmon was caused by a greater overlap between predator and prey when salmon dispersed offshore, not an increase in the number of salmon consumed per feeding bout. The results also generally supported the hypothesis that the timing of predation events modifies the nature of size-dependent predation losses of salmon to different predator groups (small and large planktivores and piscivores). Size-dependent vulnerabilities of salmon to predators were a function of both predator and prey sizes. When simulated predation was shifted from May to June, the vulnerability of salmon became more dependent on their growth than initial size. But, the size- and growth-dependent vulnerabilities of salmon differed more among predator groups than between May and June, suggesting that changes in the composition of predator fields could more strongly affect the nature of size-dependent predation than changes in the timing of predation losses.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  33     Total Times Cited:  34     Cited Reference Count:  55 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1046/j.1054-6006.2001.00042.x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),pink salmon;juvenile;foraging behaviour;size-dependent;predation;diet;PRINCE-WILLIAM-SOUND;CENTRAL BRITISH COLUMBIA;CHUM SALMON;SELECTIVE MORTALITY;MARINE MORTALITY;PACIFIC SALMON;SPRING BLOOM;FISHES;GROWTH;PATTERNS;Prednisolone,,

Our findings show that fire history and microhabitat structure influence the foraging behavior of the study species and that the influence of microhabitat varies between fire histories. GUDs were higher in long unburnt vegetation and in open microhabitats. There was a microhabitat effect in recently burnt vegetation, but not in long unburnt. Rodents foraged more in sheltered microhabitats probably because predator encounters are less likely to occur there and it provides them with greater refuge from predation.

More importantly, experimental studies also ensure that the predator-induced fear (indirect effect) may alter much behavior of the prey even more strongly than the effect of direct killing via habitat changes, vigilance, foraging, and different physiological changes. Considering this fact, we analyze a delayed predator-prey system incorporating anti-predator defense. The interaction term has been modeled using Beddington-DeAngelis functional response (BDFR). We discuss the local and global stability, permanence, and non-permanence to comprehend the dynamics of the system. By constructing a suitable Lyapunov function, globally asymptotic stability has been established. We also demonstrate that a certain value of delay may cause Hopf-bifurcation and period-doubling route to chaos. It is shown that under certain parametric conditions, the gestation delay-induced oscillations could be prevented. Using Nyquist criterion, the length of delay has been estimated for which the stability continues to hold. Moreover, we find that spatial diffusion affects the critical value of the bifurcation parameter and demonstrate the existence of spatially homogeneous periodic solutions with the change of time delay. In addition, the level of fear also affects the dynamical behaviors of the delayed system with/without diffusion. These results indicate that the gestation delay induces oscillatory coexistence mode of the interaction between predator and its prey, which reveals the driving factors for the co-existence of predator and prey in the form of periodic oscillations in actual ecosystems.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  57 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Included""}",10.1002/mma.8044     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),fear effects;gestation delay;Hopf bifurcation;Nyquist criterion;predator-prey interaction model;stability region;MUTUAL INTERFERENCE;POPULATION-GROWTH;DYNAMICS;RISK;ECOLOGY;FEAR;DISEASE;Prednisolone,,

I tested this idea with field experiments on the cleaner-fish Labroides dimidiatus and its ""client"" reef fish. Clients visit cleaners at their small territories, so-called cleaning stations, to have parasites removed. Cleaners were first observed and then caught and either put back on their original territory or moved to a new site. I noted a variety of cleaner and client behaviour to evaluate how, if at all, relationships are built up. Cleaners and resident clients indeed build up relationships, but with heavy initial investment. There was no evidence that cleaners build up relationships with client species that have access to several cleaners. Finally, it appeared that cleaners constantly invest in relationships with predatory clients, possibly to reduce the risk that predators try to catch them. I propose that asymmetries between partners with respect to either payoff values or strategic options are the major reason why the results do not fit the so-called raising-the-stakes strategy.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  27     Total Times Cited:  28     Cited Reference Count:  22 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s00265-002-0527-6     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),labroides dimidiatus;cooperation;mutualism;prisoner's dilemma;asymmetric game;COOPERATION;EVOLUTION,,

Here, we investigate the circuitry underlying innate defensive behaviours elicited by predator-like visual stimuli in mice. Our results demonstrate that neurons in the superior colliculus (SC) are essential for a variety of acute and persistent defensive responses to overhead looming stimuli. Optogenetic mapping revealed that SC projections to the lateral posterior nucleus (LP) of the thalamus, a non-canonical polymodal sensory relay, are sufficient to mimic visually evoked fear responses. In vivo electrophysiology experiments identified a di-synaptic circuit from SC through LP to the lateral amygdale (Amg), and lesions of the Amg blocked the full range of visually evoked defensive responses. Our results reveal a novel collicular-thalamic-Amg circuit important for innate defensive responses to visual threats.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  150     Total Times Cited:  158     Cited Reference Count:  70 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1038/ncomms7756     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),RAT SUPERIOR COLLICULUS;LATERAL AMYGDALA;TOPOGRAPHIC ORGANIZATION;PERIAQUEDUCTAL GRAY;DEFENSIVE RESPONSES;FACIAL EXPRESSIONS;EMOTIONAL BRAIN;MEDIAL PULVINAR;CORTEX;CONNECTIONS;Fear,,

A common strategy to avoid predation is spatio-temporal avoidance of predators, in which prey typically trade optimal resources for safety. Analogous with predator-prey theory, risk effects should also arise in species with sexually selected infanticide (SSI), in which females with dependent offspring avoid infanticidal males. SSI can be common in brown bear (Ursus arctos) populations and explains spatio-temporal segregation among reproductive classes. Here, we show that in a population with SSI, females with cubs-of-the-year had lower quality diets than conspecifics during the SSI high-risk period, the mating season. After the mating season, their diets were of similar quality to diets of their conspecifics. Our results suggest a nutritive risk effect of SSI, in which females with cubs-of-the-year alter their resource selection and trade optimal resources for offspring safety. Such risk effects can add to female costs of reproduction and may be widespread among species with SSI.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  27     Total Times Cited:  27     Cited Reference Count:  20 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1098/rsbl.2013.0624     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),brown bear;risk effects;segregation;sexually selected infanticide;SPECTROSCOPY;SEGREGATION;ENERGY;Infanticide,,

However, the temporal shift of habitat use induced by predation has rarely been observed. The study of such a mechanism is particularly relevant for introduced species because it might explain how native species can persist or decline in response to the presence of alien species. The introduction of fish into ponds inhabited by amphibians has severe consequences for their occurrence and abundance. Fish particularly affect an alternative newt phenotype, the paedomorph, which does not undergo metamorphosis and maintains larval traits such as gills at the adult stage. In a laboratory design, we assessed the diel patterns of habitat use in the 2 distinct morphological phenotypes of palmate newt (Lissotriton helveticus) in the presence or absence of goldfish (Carassius auratus). Both newt phenotypes avoided a risky habitat more in the presence than in the absence of fish. This habitat shift was more pronounced during the daytime (i.e., when the risk could be considered higher for the newts) than during nighttime. However, in contrast to metamorphs, paedomorphs showed less adaptive changes according to temporal risk and remained in their shelter for most of the time. Temporal and habitat partitioning at the diel scale between native and alien species might promote their coexistence, but diel change can also imply a cost in the overall reduction of the time allocated to essential activities, showing that species interactions remain complex.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  10     Total Times Cited:  10     Cited Reference Count:  90 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1093/beheco/arw008     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),"Alien species;amphibians;antipredator behavior;behavioral avoidance;diel pattern;paedomorphosis;risk allocation hypothesis;risk assessment;GOLDFISH CARASSIUS-AURATUS;TRITURUS-ALPESTRIS;FACULTATIVE PEDOMORPHOSIS;BEHAVIORAL-RESPONSES;ACTIVITY PATTERNS;INTRODUCED FISH;ALPINE NEWT;ANTIPREDATOR BEHAVIOR;LOCOMOTOR-ACTIVITY;FORAGING BEHAVIOR;Polymorphism, Genetic;Prednisolone",,

Game birds differ from other reared livestock because they experience two very distinct environments during their lives. Chicks are first reared in captivity for 6-12 weeks under managed, stable conditions and then released into the wild. A limited set of 13 studies have explored how the rearing conditions experienced by chicks influences their pre-release welfare, typically in terms of physical injury (feather-pecking) or behavioural assays of stress responses. However, no studies have considered the specific indicators of welfare of game birds after release. We therefore need to draw from studies that do not specifically investigate welfare but instead ones that examine how rearing environments influence post-release morphology, behaviour and survival. Consequently, we reviewed how reared and wild-born game birds differ and suggest methods by which more naturalistic rearing conditions may be achieved. We noted five areas where artificial rearing deviates substantially from natural conditions: absence of adults; unnatural chick densities; unnatural diet; unnatural physical environment; and exclusion of predation risk. Mimicking or introducing some of these elements in game bird rearing practice could bring two benefits: i) facilitating more natural behaviour by the chicks during rearing; and ii) ensuring that birds after release are better able to cope with natural hazards. Together, these could result in an improved overall welfare for game birds. For example, enrichment of the spatial environment may serve to both improve welfare pre-release and after release into the wild. However, some adaptations may induce poor welfare for a short period in the young birds. For example, exposure to predators may be temporarily stressful, but ultimately such experiences in early life may permit them to better cope with such threats when released into the wild. Therefore, to achieve an optimal welfare for the entirety of a game bird's life, a careful balance between the conditions experienced in early life and adequate preparation for later life in the wild is required.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  1     Total Times Cited:  1     Cited Reference Count:  173 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.7120/09627286.29.1.001     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),animal welfare;conservation;hunting;partridge;pheasant;reintroduction biology;GREY PARTRIDGES PERDIX;RING-NECKED PHEASANTS;TONIC IMMOBILITY REACTION;FEATHER PECKING;LAYING HENS;BREEDING SUCCESS;ANIMAL-WELFARE;PHASIANUS-COLCHICUS;STOCKING DENSITY;ALECTORIS-RUFA,,

Development of anti-predator behaviour may be impaired in captive conditions which favour low emotional reactivity, resulting in poor perception of danger. Therefore, the newly reintroduced, naive animals may not behave adaptively in terms of anti-predator vigilance, resulting in increased vulnerability to predators. Such behavioural deficiencies may have contributed to the low success rates of reintroductions, but few studies have measured post-release vigilance in captive-bred animals, and none has been published on reintroduced grey partridges. Therefore, in this study we investigated post-release vigilance behaviour and time budgets in coveys of captive-bred grey partridges (Perdix perdix: N = 26) released in autumn over two years. We observed the captive-bred grey partridge coveys in the field, and recorded their group vigilance rates as well as time budgets of individual behaviour, including vigilance and feeding. Released grey partridges had low group vigilance rates and showed poor individual vigilance (4-5% of time spent vigilant) compared to their wild counterparts (43% of time spent vigilant; Watson et al., 2007). Moreover, released individuals spent 30-48% of their time feeding, and fed at this rate throughout the day, instead of concentrating their feeding around dawn and dusk like wild grey partridges do. The revealed vigilance and feeding behaviour in released grey partridges are likely to increase vulnerability to predators, and therefore offer plausible explanations for the high predation rates of released grey partridges observed with these and previous releases. Rearing methods should be developed to encourage wariness in the captive animals. In addition, the adaptive bimodal feeding routine of wild grey partridges should be encouraged in the captive-bred birds, for example by feeding them only at dawn and dusk. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Animals need to weigh their activity budget to fulfill their energetic, social and reproductive requirements over the energetic costs of these activities. This task becomes further challenging for prey species, which also need to account for predation risk. To investigate the factors shaping proactive behavioral decisions leading prey species engagement in their diel activities, we implemented a multisite year-round monitoring study on the Iberian rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus algirus), a key prey species in Mediterranean ecosystems. We deployed remotely triggered cameras over 15 sites to continuously monitor Iberian rabbits' activity. We estimated activity levels from time-of-detection data from camera traps, and modeled it as a function of climatic, intraspecific, predation, and resource-related covariates. We found that Iberian rabbits exhibit a bimodal activity pattern peaking at sunrise and sunset, with a more pronounced peak occurring at sunrise during the nonbreeding season, and spend 9.15 +/- 3.00 h/day (mean +/- sd) active. Diel activity levels were negatively affected by extreme environmental temperatures and density dependence, demonstrating the privileged importance of social interactions and normothermia maintenance. We found mammalian predator activity and abundance to have near-negligible effects on the activity levels of this key prey, suggesting decreased antipredator behavior when risk is perceived as prolonged. Moreover, we argue that perceived risk may be more important than realized risk in shaping Iberian rabbits' activity level. These results provide valuable insights toward a comprehensive understanding of the factors underlying behavioral decisions made by prey species, relevant for maintaining their energetic and homeostatic balance.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  113 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/jzo.12947     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),activity budgets;activity level;diel activity;European rabbit;Oryctolagus cuniculus algirus;predation risk;thermoregulation;RABBIT ORYCTOLAGUS-CUNICULUS;EUROPEAN WILD RABBITS;GROUP-SIZE;ACTIVITY PATTERNS;PHYSIOLOGICAL-RESPONSES;ANTIDORCAS-MARSUPIALIS;TEMPORAL VARIATION;NATIONAL-PARK;VIGILANCE;ABUNDANCE;Body Temperature Regulation;Prednisolone,,

Hungry and satiated salamanders were exposed to chemical stimuli from a predatory fish (sculpin, Cottus carolinae) and from two nonpredatory species, golden redhorse fish (Moxostoma erythrurum) and tadpoles of leopard frogs (Rana sphenocephala). Latency to attack prey was lengthened in the presence of chemical stimuli from predators regardless of hunger levels, but hungry salamanders had shorter latency times than satiated salamanders. There was no interaction between hunger and threat levels. In addition, salamanders distinguished between chemical stimuli from predatory (sculpin) and nonpredatory (redhorse) fishes; responses to redhorse and tadpole stimuli were not different. Handling limes were not affected by either predator treatment or hunger level. In summary, graybelly salamanders can (1) recognize sculpin predators based solely on chemical cues, (2) distinguish between chemical stimuli from predatory and nonpredatory fish, and (3) adjust their foraging behavior according to both hunger and predation risk.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  43     Total Times Cited:  45     Cited Reference Count:  27 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1023/A:1005590913680     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),foraging behavior;predator recognition;risk assessment;hunger levels;condition-dependent behavior;graybelly salamander;banded sculpin;Eurycea multiplicata;Cottus carolinae;TERRESTRIAL SALAMANDERS;GASTEROSTEUS-ACULEATUS;CUES;STICKLEBACKS;DECISIONS;TADPOLES;MINNOWS;Prednisolone,,

We conducted fecal pellet and wolf scat surveys in three valleys with three wolf population levels (Saint Mary: low; Waterton: moderate; North Fork: high). In the North Fork, 90% of quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) stands burned recently; the other valleys had no fire. We created predictive models of elk pellet density that incorporated bottom-up and top-down variables. All valleys had a high elk pellet density (>= 10 per 100 m(2)). Wolf scat density was similar where there was no fire, but one order of magnitude greater in burned areas. Elk pellet density was lower in the North Fork, a predation-related response. In all valleys, site-specific elk density declined as impediments to detecting or escaping wolves increased, and elk avoided aspen, except for North Fork unburned areas. Models that best predicted elk density contained bottom-up and top-down effects. At local scales, high predation risk negatively influence elk occurrence, suggesting that even with minimal wolf exposure elk avoid risky sites.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  7     Total Times Cited:  7     Cited Reference Count:  78 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1139/cjz-2014-0138     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),elk;Cervus elaphus;predation risk;wolves;Canis lupus;trophic cascades;YELLOWSTONE-NATIONAL-PARK;TROPHIC CASCADES;COMMUNITY STRUCTURE;POPULATION-CONTROL;HABITAT SELECTION;FOOD WEBS;TOP-DOWN;WOLVES;ASPEN;PREY;Prednisolone,,

Little research has been conducted on the behavioral responses of wildlife when encountering these novel structures over time. We used the installation of new wildlife road crossing structures built along a 6000-year old migration route to evaluate behavioral responses of long-distance migrators to the structures. We collected behavioral data during and after construction in order to evaluate individuals' immediate responses to these structures and to investigate how they changed over time using generalized linear mixed-effects models and generalized additive models fit by maximum likelihood. Pronghorn acclimated to the crossing structures and the frequency in which they successfully crossed them increased over time. The probability of pronghorn successfully crossing a structure was not influenced by human presence. Pronghorn spent more time in sustained vigilance behaviors after construction. Pronghorn also spent more time in sustained vigilance behaviors at relatively further distances from a structure and lead individuals spent more time in sustained vigilance behaviors than non-lead individuals. We did not detect any significant factors associated with stress behaviors. Pronghorn still demonstrated high sustained vigilance when approaching the structures after 20 months post construction, despite an increase in crossing success. While we found evidence of risk-avoidance behaviors in pronghorn at crossing structures, this work provides evidence that pronghorn gradually acclimated to wildlife crossing structures built in a historical migration corridor in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. We recommend using task completion chronology (rather than project completion dates) to install wildlife mitigation and we recommend using wildlife friendly fencing when fences are required for multiple use (e.g., cattle) at crossing structure entrances.

For males, one element of risk that is rarely considered is that a female mate may not survive to offspring independence, resulting in total reproductive failure. This element of risk could be particularly important in short-lived species where all individuals, regardless of condition, attempt to reproduce, and developing mature eggs is a time and energetically expensive process during which females are at risk of predation, starvation, and disease. I evaluate whether males use female survival probability as a mate choice criterion in the golden orb-web spider Nephila clavipes by assessing how male reproductive investment changes depending on female proximity to oviposition. Using a field experiment and a controlled mating experiment, I show that males mate at higher frequencies, transfer more sperm, and father more offspring in the first clutch when mated with nonvirgin females close to oviposition compared with younger nonvirgin females. Furthermore, females close to oviposition have a lower probability of mortality prior to egg deposition compared with virgin females and young nonvirgin adult females. These findings support the hypothesis that males invest more reproductive effort as a female approaches oviposition, possibly because these females are a low-risk mating investment.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  16     Total Times Cited:  16     Cited Reference Count:  61 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1093/beheco/arq222     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),male mate choice;partner mortality;risk;sperm allocation;sperm competition;ORB-WEAVING SPIDER;SPERM COMPETITION GAMES;CRYPTIC FEMALE CHOICE;MALE MATE CHOICE;SEXUAL SELECTION;PREDATION RISK;MALE ADVANTAGE;MALE COURTSHIP;BODY-SIZE;ARANEAE,,

We conducted two experiments to study the foraging decisions of white-browed sparrow-weavers (Plocepasser mahali). The first experiment manipulated both direct and indirect cues in a feeding array by simultaneously placing feeding stations at different distances from humans (to manipulate direct risk) and from protective cover (to manipulate indirect risk). Weaver foraging was influenced more by indirect risk than by direct risk. The second experiment aimed to determine if weaver's indirect risk assessment was sensitive to variation in benefits. We set two feeding stations at different distances from cover but the same distance from the human observers and systematically increased the amount of food at the station farther from cover. Weavers far from cover initially foraged at higher rates than those close to cover, but the addition of food reduced the foraging rate. Together, our results illustrate that weaver foraging decisions are sensitive to variation in risk and that indirect cues are relatively more important than direct cues.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  8     Total Times Cited:  8     Cited Reference Count:  34 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s10211-009-0059-4     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Indirect cues;Direct cues;Predation risk assessment;PREDATION RISK;CROWNED SPARROWS;COVER;VIGILANCE;DISTANCE;BEHAVIOR;DOMINANCE;RESPONSES;RODENT;CHOICE;Risk Assessment;Cues;European Continental Ancestry Group,,

The model assumes the classical foraging predation risk trade-offs: increased activity increases population growth rate, but it also increases mortality rate. The model considers three scenarios: prey only are adaptive, predators only are adaptive, and both species are adaptive. Under all these scenarios, the neutral stability of the classical Lotka-Volterra model is partially lost because the amplitude of maximum oscillation in species numbers is bounded, and the bound is independent of the initial population numbers. Moreover, if both prey and predators behave adaptively, the neutral stability can be completely lost, and a globally stable equilibrium would appear. This is because prey and/or predator switching leads to a piecewise constant prey ( predator) isocline with a vertical ( horizontal) part that limits the amplitude of oscillations in prey and predator numbers, exactly as suggested by Rosenzweig and MacArthur in their seminal work on graphical stability analysis of predator-prey systems. Prey and predator activities in a long-term run are calculated explicitly. This article shows that predictions based on short-term behavioral experiments may not correspond to long-term predictions when population dynamics are considered.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  41     Total Times Cited:  41     Cited Reference Count:  73 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Included""}",10.1086/522055     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),adaptive foraging;antipredator behavior;predator-prey;population dynamics;predator-prey games;trait-mediated interactions;ideal free distribution;IDEAL FREE DISTRIBUTION;HABITAT SELECTION;POPULATION-DYNAMICS;FOOD;TIME;STABILITY;CHOICE;DISTRIBUTIONS;CONSEQUENCES;COMPETITION;Prednisolone,,

Mosquitoes Aedes triseriatus (Say) and Auks albopictus (Skuse) encounter predatory Corethrella appendiculata (Grabham) and Toxorhynchites rutilus (Coquillett) in small containers and show antipredatory behavioral responses. We investigated the sources of the predation cues to which these prey larvae respond. We tested whether Ae. albopictus larvae show behavioral responses to cues emanating from the predator or from damage to prey caused by the act of predation. We also tested whether Ae. triseriatus respond to cues present in fluid or solid residues from predator activity. Ae. albopictus showed behavioral modifications only in response to waterborne cues from a feeding predator and not to cues from a starving predator, indicating that Ae. albopictus respond to cues created by the act of predation, which could include substances derived from damaged prey or substances in predator feces. Ae. triseriatus showed behavioral responses to solid residues from predation but not to fluid without those solids, indicating that the cues to which they respond originate in predator feces or uneaten prey body parts.

Yet, the consequences of behavioral responses toward human disturbances on vital rates rarely have been investigated. Herein, we assessed the cumulative and instantaneous effects of human disturbances (roads, human settlements, mines and mining exploration) at different temporal scales on the mortality risk of 254 GPS- collared migratory caribou monitored in two herds, the Riviere-aux-Feuilles (RFH) and Riviere-George (RGH) herds, in northern Quebec and Labrador, Canada. We also assessed the relative importance of human disturbances on caribou mortality risk compared with non-anthropogenic factors, including habitat use by caribou, predation risk by gray wolves (Canis lupus), and local weather conditions. Human disturbances alone, exclusive of hunting, had a limited impact on mortality risk of caribou. Repeated exposure to disturbances did not have detectable effects on mortality risk during the early life period (1-7 years old), but more abundant precipitation (RFH) or the use of areas with a higher predation risk (RGH) did so. At the seasonal scale, non-anthropogenic factors, particularly the use of highly selected habitat by caribou and air temperature, had a greater effect than anthropogenic factors on the mortality risk in the RFH. Caribou of the RFH using more frequently higlhy selected habitats decreased their chance of mortality during winter, whereas individuals using warmer areas during summer faced a higher risk of mortality. At the daily scale, we observed that anthropogenic and non-anthropogenic factors generally had either no effect on the daily risk of mortality, or their effects were undistinguishable from the effect of latitude, with which they were highly correlated. The only exception was for the RFH in winter, for which the daily risk of mortality increased 10 folds for each 10-km increment closer to industrial disturbances. Although the impacts of human disturbances on caribou survival were limited to specific regions and areas, we nevertheless detected a negative effect on survival on the RFH, even at the currently low level of human development. Our study highlights the importance of assessing effects of human disturbances at various spatiotemporal scales, and of considering the relative influence of other non-anthropogenic factors to fully understand drives of wildlife populations.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  2     Total Times Cited:  3     Cited Reference Count:  103 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.3389/fevo.2020.00154     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),habitat use;human disturbance;migratory caribou;mortality risk;predation risk;weather conditions;RANGIFER-TARANDUS-GROENLANDICUS;WOODLAND CARIBOU;ARCTIC CARIBOU;HABITAT LOSS;RESOURCE SELECTION;CUMULATIVE IMPACTS;THREATENED CARIBOU;INSECT HARASSMENT;ECOLOGICAL TRAPS;LINEAR FEATURES;Humanities;Humanism;Humans,,

But a recent study by Magnhagen and Staffan (Behav Ecol Sociobiol 57:295-303, 2005) on young perch in small groups showed that boldness, a central personality trait, is also shaped by social interactions and by previous experience. The authors measured boldness by recording the duration that an individual spent near a predator and the speed with which it fed there. They found that duration near the predator increased over time and was higher the higher the average boldness of other group members. In addition, the feeding rate of shy individuals was reduced if other members of the same group were bold. The authors supposed that these behavioral dynamics were caused by genetic differences, social interactions, and habituation to the predator. However, they did not quantify exactly how this could happen. In the present study, we therefore use an agent-based model to investigate whether these three factors may explain the empirical findings. We choose an agent-based model because this type of model is especially suited to study the relation between behavior at an individual level and behavioral dynamics at a group level. In our model, individuals were either hiding in vegetation or feeding near a predator, whereby their behavior was affected by habituation and by two social mechanisms: social facilitation to approach the predator and competition over food. We show that even if we start the model with identical individuals, these three mechanisms were sufficient to reproduce the behavioral dynamics of the empirical study, including the consistent differences among individuals. Moreover, if we start the model with individuals that already differ in boldness, the behavioral dynamics produced remained the same.

It, along with time allocation, can be used by a forager to manage risk. Apprehension should increase, and time allocation should decrease with a forager's energetic state (marginal value of energy). We tested these predictions on Allenby's gerbils (Gerbillus andersoni allenbyi) by manipulating the energetic state of the gerbils through augmentations of millet seeds. We also manipulated two risk factors, the microhabitat of the foraging patch (bush or open) and the presence of barn owls (Tyto alba). We measured apprehension of gerbils using the selectivity of gerbils for trays that differed in the distribution of seeds that they contained and time allocation using the amount of seeds left behind in trays, the giving-up density (GUD). Gerbils harvested 4.6 times more seeds when supplemental seeds were available, 17.4% fewer seeds when owls were present, 25.8% fewer seeds from the open than the bush microhabitat, and 19.3% fewer seeds from trays when seed augmentations were also present. With regard to time allocation, gerbils had higher GUDs (allocated less time) when risk was higher: in the open microhabitat and in the presence of owls. Also, the response of gerbils to owls was affected both by the seed augmentation and by microhabitat. With regard to apprehension, the gerbils were more apprehensive when extra seeds were added. Their level of apprehension changed little in the bush microhabitat but increased greatly in the open microhabitat when energetic state was manipulated. Thus, gerbils use both time allocation and apprehension in response to predators. Changes in the energetic state of a forager led to the predicted increase in apprehension accordance with Clark's asset protection principle.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  136     Total Times Cited:  137     Cited Reference Count:  23 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1890/03-3002     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),apprehension;energetic state;foraging theory;gerbils;giving-up densities;Negev Desert;optimal patch use;risk of predation;time allocation;tradeoffs of food and safety;PATCH USE;BEHAVIORAL DECISIONS;HABITAT SELECTION;FORAGING GAMES;GROUP-SIZE;VIGILANCE;BOUNDARIES;SQUIRRELS;ECOLOGY;MODELS;Gerbillinae,,

We assessed whether combined unimodal cues would enhance antipredator behaviour in captivity by presenting 10 wild-caught ship rats, Rattus rattus, with direct and indirect simulated visual predation cues, either alone or in combination. We measured changes in activity and foraging behaviours to examine how antipredator behaviour differed when rats were exposed to bright light (an indirect visual predation cue), a looming stimulus (a direct visual predation cue that simulates an attacking aerial predator) and bright light combined with the looming stimulus (direct and indirect visual cues combined). In most cases, the combined visual cues significantly enhanced antipredator responses relative to control conditions (i.e. no looming stimulus and low light); rats adopted cautious foraging strategies and exhibited sustained avoidance behaviour. Ship rats appear to amplify their responses to risk when exposed to combined unimodal predation cues; the finding could be exploited to control the activities of rodent pests, but also warns of possible impacts of multiple sensory pollutants.

Novel changes to the foodscape, such as human disturbance, can alter behavioral decisions that favor avoidance of perceived risk over food acquisition. Although behavioral changes and population declines often coincide with the introduction of human disturbance, the link(s) between behavior and population trajectory are difficult to elucidate. To identify a pathway by which human disturbance may affect ungulate populations, we tested the Behaviorally Mediated Forage-Loss Hypothesis, wherein behavioral avoidance is predicted to reduce use of available forage adjacent to disturbance. We used GPS collar data collected from migratory mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) to evaluate habitat selection, movement patterns, and time-budgeting behavior in response to varying levels of forage availability and human disturbance in three different populations exposed to a gradient of energy development. Subsequently, we linked animal behavior with measured use of forage relative to human disturbance, forage availability, and quality. Mule deer avoided human disturbance at both home range and winter range scales, but showed negligible differences in vigilance rates at the site level. Use of the primary winter forage, sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata), increased as production of new annual growth increased but use decreased with proximity to disturbance. Consequently, avoidance of human disturbance prompted loss of otherwise available forage, resulting in indirect habitat loss that was 4.6-times greater than direct habitat loss from roads, well pads, and other infrastructure. The multiplicative effects of indirect habitat loss, as mediated by behavior, impaired use of the foodscape by reducing the amount of available forage for mule deer, a consequence of which may be winter ranges that support fewer animals than they did before development.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  17     Total Times Cited:  17     Cited Reference Count:  98 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1002/eap.1972     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Behaviorally Mediated Forage-Loss Hypothesis;energy development;forage use;habitat selection;human disturbance;indirect habitat loss;movement patterns;mule deer;Odocoileus hemionus;perceived risk;time-budgeting behavior;HABITAT SELECTION PATTERNS;PREDATION RISK;MULE DEER;BEHAVIORAL-RESPONSES;RESOURCE SELECTION;HUMAN DISTURBANCE;MAMMALIAN HERBIVORES;TEMPORAL VARIATION;ENERGY DEVELOPMENT;ELK,,

This information, processed in multiple regions of the brain, ultimately result in the production of stress hormones and visible changes in behaviour of animals - both reflexively to avoid depredation and strategically to avoid an encounter with the predator. In a common-garden experiment we tested how imperfect information from visual cues of a predator impacts foraging and apprehension of a desert rodent, the Egyptian gerbil (Gerbillus pyramidum). The gerbils were exposed to predation by barn owls (Tyto alba), one camouflaged on dark nights using black dye. Gerbils' response to the owls was measured using patch-use measured in giving-up densities (GUDs) and time spent in vigilance activity. Owl lethality was extrapolated from mean times spent in attacks and number of attempted strikes. Dyed owls attack-rate was lower and attack duration greater than those of the white owls. During the full moon, when dyed owls were visible, gerbils responded with extreme vigilance and minimal foraging (high GUDs). During the new moon when the owls were most stealthy, the gerbils showed low vigilance coupled with a similar high GUD. The inconsistency between gerbils' foraging and vigilance behaviours, suggest a likely mismatch between perceived risk and actual measurement of predator lethality gathered by the gerbils' observations in real time.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  2     Total Times Cited:  2     Cited Reference Count:  48 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.beproc.2020.104161     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Apprehension;Behavioural ecology;Evolutionary game theory;Harvest-rate curves;Predator-prey dynamics;Risk-estimation;PATCH USE;HABITAT SELECTION;FORAGING GAMES;RISK;PREY;BEHAVIOR;ALLOCATION;LANDSCAPE;VIGILANCE;FISH;Gerbillinae;Prednisolone,,

We studied the temporal variation in foraging behavior of voles exposed to uniform mustelid predation risk and heterogeneous avian predation risk of different levels induced by vegetation types in eight outdoor enclosures (0.25 ha). We manipulated mustelid predation risk with weasel presence or absence and avian predation risk by reducing or providing local cover at experimental food patches. Foraging at food patches was monitored by collecting giving-up densities at artificial food patches, overall activity was automatically monitored, and mortality of voles was monitored by live-trapping and radiotracking. Voles depleted the food to lower levels in the sheltered patches than in the exposed ones. In enclosures with higher avian predation risk caused by lower vegetation height, trays were depleted to lower levels. Unexpectedly, voles foraged in more trays and depleted trays to lower levels in the presence of weasels than in the absence. Weasels match their prey's body size and locomotive abilities and therefore increase predation risk uniformly over both foraging sites and refuge sites that can both be entered by the predator. This reduces the costs of missing opportunities other than foraging. Voles changed their foraging strategy accordingly by specializing on the experimental food patches with predictable returns and probably reduced their foraging in the matrix of natural food source with unpredictable returns and high risk to encounter the weasel. Moreover, after 1 day of weasel presence, voles shifted their main foraging activities to avoid the diurnal weasel. This behavior facilitated bird predation, probably by nocturnal owls, and more voles were killed by birds than by weasels. Food patch use of voles in weasel enclosures increased with time. Voles had to balance the previously missed feeding opportunities by progressively concentrating on artificial food patches.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  45     Total Times Cited:  47     Cited Reference Count:  44 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s00442-008-1100-4     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),antipredatory behavior;avian predation;bank voles;mustelid predation;predator facilitation;predator interaction;temporal variation;TREE SEEDLING PREDATION;POPULATION-CYCLES;MICROHABITAT USE;PATCH USE;BEHAVIOR;NIVALIS;EXPLANATION;PREFERENCE;WEASEL;Prednisolone,,

We analyzed whether the foraging behavior of wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus) was affected by the presence and activity of small-spotted genets (Genetta genetta) at ""risky"" baiting stations monitored with automatic cameras. Sampling stations in 6 x 6 grids spaced at 250 m were arranged in 3 habitat types (shrubland, pine woodland, and holm oak woodland). Grids were sampled systematically by means of groups of 2-9 cameras monitoring sampling stations during a week. We obtained 377 independent contacts of wood mice and 35 independent contacts of at least 8 different genets. Patterns of habitat use by genets and wood mice were spatially discordant, because only 2 cameras detected both. Wood mice visited baits more often and during longer periods in groups of sampling stations where genets were not detected than in groups where genets were detected within the same week. Mean time spent foraging by genets negatively influenced both the number of foraging bouts per night and the mean duration of such bouts by mice using nearby baits. Finally, temporal patterns of activity of mice along the night were different depending on whether genets were foraging nearby. Temporal patterns of mice when and where genets were absent were positively correlated with patterns of genet activity, whereas mice patterns were negatively correlated with genet patterns when and where genets were present. Sampling dates, habitat types, and moonlight levels did not seem to have influenced these results. Wood mice showed spatial and temporal changes in foraging behavior in response to the presence of genets, and decisions about how often and how long to forage were affected by foraging activity of genets. Results obtained provided direct evidence of a foraging game of stealth and fear between mice and their predator that could help to explain mice distribution in Mediterranean postfire habitats.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  28     Total Times Cited:  31     Cited Reference Count:  53 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1644/04-MAMM-A-127R1.1     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Apodemus sylvaticus;foraging behavior;Genetta genetta;Mediterranean forests and shrublands;predation risk;spatiotemporal patterns;PREDATION RISK;FOOD AVAILABILITY;SMALL MAMMALS;CENTRAL SPAIN;BANK VOLES;PATCH USE;SPACE USE;ECOLOGY;HABITAT;RODENT;Mice,,

Nest predation affects breeding site choice, and has been suggested to drive niche segregation and local coexistence of species. Interspecific social information use may, in turn, result in copying or rejection of heterospecific niche characteristics and thus affect realized niche overlap between species. We tested experimentally whether a migratory bird, the pied flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca, collects information about nest predation risk from indirect cues of predators visiting nests of heterospecific birds. Furthermore, we investigated whether the migratory birds can associate such information with a specific nest site characteristic and generalize the information to their own nest site choice.ResultsOur results demonstrate that flycatchers can use the fate of heterospecific nesting attempts in their own nest site choice, but do so selectively. Young flycatcher females, when making the decision quickly, associated the fate of an artificial nest with nest-site characteristics and avoided the characteristic associated with higher nest predation risk.ConclusionsCopying nest site choices of successful heterospecifics, and avoiding choices which led to failed attempts, may amplify or counter effects of nest predation on niche overlap, with important consequences for between-species niche divergence-convergence dynamics, species coexistence and predator-prey interactions.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  7     Total Times Cited:  8     Cited Reference Count:  57 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1186/s12862-018-1301-3     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Social information;Nest site choice;Predation risk;Realized niche;Species coexistence;Intraspecific variation;PUBLIC INFORMATION;HABITAT SELECTION;FITNESS CONSEQUENCES;BEHAVIORAL-RESPONSES;SOCIAL CUES;ECOLOGY;DENSITY;COEXISTENCE;POPULATION;MECHANISMS;Prednisolone,,

The selection of prey types in the presence of predators may be subjected to pressure on both reproduction and survival. Here, we analyze the evolutionary game dynamics of two types of prey in the presence of predators. We call this model the predator-dependent replicator dynamics. If the evolutionary time scales are different, the number of predators can be assumed constant, and the traditional replicator dynamics is recovered. However, if the time scales are the same, we end up with sixteen possible dynamics: the combinations of four reproduction's games with four predation's games. We analyze the dynamics and calculate conditions for the coexistence of prey and predator. The main result is that predators can change the equilibrium of the traditional replicator dynamics. For example, the presence of predators can induce polymorphism in prey if one type of prey is more attractive than the other, with the prey ending with a lower capture rate in this new equilibrium. Lastly, we provide two illustrations of the dynamics, which can be seen as rapid feedback responses in a predator-prey evolutionary arm's race.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  52 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1088/1751-8121/ac40e4     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),eco evolutionary dynamics;evolutionary game theory;replicator equation;two-prey one-predator model;EVOLUTIONARILY STABLE STRATEGIES;2 PREY;GAME;SIZE;SELECTION;BEHAVIOR;MODEL;RISK;Prednisolone,,

Cannibalism has, however, not evolved and is not maintained by a simple individual optimization, while it has evolved and is maintained as a game among population members. We analysed the attainable state of an evolutionary cannibalism game within a framework that reflects the minimum essence of cause-effect in the cannibalism phenomenon. Cannibalism is predator-prey interaction among conspecifics. Immediate direct payoffs (survival in the interaction among conspecifics) and indirect payoffs (growth results in potential productivity and survival against the threat of starvation) would be included. No morphological specialization and no size priority of cannibalism individuals are assumed as conservative situations in which we analyse the possibility of cannibalism. Cannibalism would be possible under the conservative condition, if initially the wild population's cannibalism rate is not sufficiently lower than a threshold value. Crowding and/or low availability of alternative prey with the fear of starvation facilitates cannibalism evolution. Energy gain from conspecific prey would be attenuated by costs of counterattacks by conspecific victims and by challenge cost of its own. Discounting net intake energy required in the arms race for cannibalism challenge result in a relative disadvantage of having a high cannibalism rate and makes an evolutionary equilibrium of low cannibalism rate, even when potential profitability of conspecific prey is high.

We examined how habitat selection by bison (Bison bison) varied as a function of group size and interpreted these patterns by testing whether habitat selection was more strongly driven by the competing demands of forage intake vs. predator avoidance behavior. We developed an analytical framework that integrated group size into resource selection functions (RSFs). These group-size-dependent RSFs were based on a matched case control design and were estimated using conditional logistic regression (mixed and population-averaged models). Fitting RSF models to bison revealed that bison groups responded to multiple aspects of landscape heterogeneity and that selection varied seasonally and as a function of group size. For example, roads were selected in summer, but not in winter. Bison groups avoided areas of high snow water equivalent in winter. They selected areas composed of a large proportion of meadow area within a 700-m radius, and within those areas, bison selected meadows. Importantly, the strength of selection for meadows varied as a function of group size, with stronger selection being observed in larger groups. Hence the bison-habitat relationship depended in part on the dynamics of group formation and division. Group formation was most likely in meadows. In contrast, risk of group fission increased when bison moved into the forest and was higher during the time of day when movements are generally longer and more variable among individuals. We also found that stronger selection for meadows by large rather than small bison groups was caused by longer residence time in individual meadows by larger groups and that departure from meadows appears unlikely to result from a depression in food intake rate. These group-size-dependent patterns were consistent with the hypothesis that avoidance of predation risk is the strongest driver of habitat selection.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  173     Total Times Cited:  175     Cited Reference Count:  52 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1890/08-0345.1     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),"Bison bison;conditional logistic regression;exploitative competition;free-ranging plains bison;GPS radio collars;group size effects;habitat selection;predation risk;Prince Albert National Park, Saskatchewan, Canada;resource selection function;YELLOWSTONE-NATIONAL-PARK;MULTIPLE SPATIAL SCALES;ROCKY-MOUNTAIN ELK;RESOURCE SELECTION;MAMMALIAN HERBIVORES;FUNCTIONAL-RESPONSE;SERENGETI GRAZERS;SOCIAL COHESION;ROE DEER;LANDSCAPE;Prednisolone",,

The optimal level of a forager's vigilance should be affected by its encounter rate with predators and the effectiveness of its vigilance in reducing mortality risk. The physical structure of the environment can alter the effectiveness of its vigilance and therefore alter its foraging behaviour. We tested this for gerbils at risk of predation from barn owls or foxes in a large vivarium. In particular, we reduced the effectiveness of vigilance by placing obstructions around feeding trays that blocked sight lines along either the vertical (vigilance directed against owls) or horizontal axis (vigilance directed against foxes), thereby changing the physical structure of the environment. In addition, we manipulated the presence of foxes and owls. In general, gerbils harvested fewer seeds, allocated less time to foraging in dangerous patches, and used more vigilance while foraging where and when risks were higher (i.e. in the presence of predators and in bright moonlight). Vertical and horizontal sightline treatments interacted synergistically to further raise perceived risk.        These results imply that blocking sight lines reduces the effectiveness of vigilance, causing gerbils to use it less. Moreover, in the presence of a predator, the gerbils 'response to the blocked sightlines was more severe - harvesting less food and spending less time and vigilance - in the patches with the increased risk. This was especially so in the presence of the predator that was expected to most benefit from blocking that particular type of sight line: cover that blocked vertical sight lines was riskiest in the presence of owls, and cover that blocked horizontal sight lines was riskiest in the presence of foxes. These results strongly indicate the importance of sightlines and landscape features such as bushes in the risk management and forging decisions of gerbils, demonstrating that bush cover provides mixed blessing to gerbils by providing cover, but making vigilance ineffective.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  73     Total Times Cited:  75     Cited Reference Count:  35 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/j.1600-0706.2011.19278.x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),FORAGING GAMES;ANTIPREDATOR VIGILANCE;VISUAL OBSTRUCTIONS;BEHAVIOR;APPREHENSION;COVER;COSTS;RATES;AVOIDANCE;STARLINGS;Risk Management;Gerbillinae;Prednisolone,,

Amplitude reduction of the P300 event-related potential component reflects attention-mediated processing deficits and is among the most replicated biological findings in schizophrenia, making it a candidate biomarker of psychosis risk. The relative extent to which deficits in P300 amplitudes elicited by auditory and visual oddball stimuli precede psychosis onset during the PRS and predict transition to psychosis, however, remains unclear. Forty-three individuals meeting PRS criteria, 19 schizophrenia patients, and 43 healthy control (HC) participants completed baseline electroencephalography recording during separate auditory and visual oddball tasks. Two subcomponents of P300 were measured: P3b, elicited by infrequent target stimuli, and P3a, elicited by infrequent nontarget novel stimuli. Auditory and visual target P3b and novel P3a amplitudes were reduced in PRS and schizophrenia participants relative to HC participants. In addition, baseline auditory and visual target P3b, but not novel P3a, amplitudes were reduced in 15 PRS participants who later converted to psychosis, relative to 18 PRS non-converters who were followed for at least 22 months. Furthermore, target P3b amplitudes predicted time to psychosis onset among PRS participants. These results suggest that P300 amplitude deficits across auditory and visual modalities emerge early in the schizophrenia illness course and precede onset of full psychosis. Moreover, target P3b may represent an important neurophysiological vulnerability marker of the imminence of risk for psychosis.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  24     Total Times Cited:  26     Cited Reference Count:  124 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1093/schbul/sby167     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),clinical high risk;auditory deviance processing;longitudinal;event-related potential;electroen cephalography;EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS;CLINICAL HIGH-RISK;ULTRA-HIGH RISK;TERM-FOLLOW-UP;1ST-EPISODE SCHIZOPHRENIA;MISMATCH NEGATIVITY;UNTREATED PSYCHOSIS;INTERRATER RELIABILITY;PRODROMAL SYNDROMES;CLOZAPINE THERAPY;Schizophrenia;Psychotic Disorders,,

This implies that there is an optimal group size and vigilance rate that will maximize individual fitness. While this basic theory of vigilance has been modelled and tested extensively, it has often been assumed that the predator represents a 'fixed-risk' such that groups of prey are essentially independent entities that exert little or no effect on one another either directly or indirectly. We argue that this is an over-simplification, and propose that the behaviour of one group of prey will likely affect the fitness of another local group of prey if the predator preferentially attacks the most vulnerable group-rather than attack both with constant rates. Using a numerical simulation model, we make the first examination of this game and allow the prey to dynamically evolve both optimal group size distributions between two habitats and vigilance rates in response to a predator with a preference for whichever group is the more vulnerable. We show that the density of prey in the population and the sensitivity of a predator to differences in prey vulnerability are likely to drive the dynamics of such a game. This novel approach to vigilance theory opens the door to several challenging lines of future research, both experimental and theoretical.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  14     Total Times Cited:  14     Cited Reference Count:  24 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1098/rspb.2005.3421     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),simulation model;vigilance;game dynamics;group size;GROUP-SIZE;COLLECTIVE DETECTION;VIGILANCE;PREY;DILUTION;Prednisolone,,

Nat.""]",146,3,365-397,"LUCAS, JR and HOWARD, RD",,English,,,"Intense mating competition and mate choice has favored the evolution of alternative mating tactics in many species. We developed a stochastic dynamic game to evaluate the choice among three alternative mating tactics by male anurans: call, satellite, or leave the chorus to forage or hide. The strategies were assumed to differ in mating success (call > satellite > forage = hide), predation risk (call > satellite > forage > hide), and energetic expense (call > satellite = hide > forage). Six major predictions were derived. First, in relatively stable environments, males should enter a chorus in a synchronous pulsed pattern, with first-year males primarily choosing to be satellites on older calling males. The pulsed pattern is caused by the relatively high energetic cost of calling and the dependence of female arrival rates on chorus size (which promotes synchronization). In unstable environments, energetic constraints are reduced because favorable conditions are rare, so most males should call on favorable nights. Under all conditions, energy-constrained males should forage. Second, with an accelerating relationship between female arrival rate (measured per calling male) and chorus size, first-year males in a stable environment should drop out of choruses before the end of the breeding season because the payoff to attendance decreases as the population declines; with a decelerating function, first-year males should remain the entire year. In an unstable environment, males should enter a chorus on favorable days, irrespective of the shape of the female arrival function. Third, variation in the form of predation risk with respect to chorus size has little or no effect on mating patterns; however, high mean predation risk should increase the frequency of satellites in the chorus. Fourth, conflicts can occur between old males that are selected to call and young males that are selected to act as satellites. Under some conditions, the only resolution to this conflict is for all males to abandon the chorus. Fifth, if there are differences among first-year males in when they come into breeding condition, the few males that mature early should be satellites. Later in the season, first-year males should tend to call. This prediction is unaffected by density dependence in predation risk, but it does not hold when female arrival rate is density-independent. Finally, first-year males should call more when their mating success decreases with an increase in the number of calling older males in comparison with conditions in which mating success is a fixed fraction of the mating success of older males. We show that the properties of a number of anuran species make them amenable to test these predictions.

Predation risk, however, cannot be implicated as a factor in habitat selection by prey without data comparing quality of selected and avoided habitats, along with the predation risk associated with those habitats. If forage benefits and predation risk are not positively correlated among habitat types, then predation risk may have little influence on the habitat selected by prey. We evaluated habitat selection by mountain lions (Puma concolor) and mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) in the eastern Sierra Nevada, California, USA, from 1994 to 1997, to determine how forage benefit or risk of predation by mountain lions affects habitat selection by mule deer. Mountain lions were the primary predator of mule deer in our study area. Stands of bitterbrush (Purshia tridentata) in the Great Basin provided more cover for mule deer than surrounding patches of rabbitbrush (Chrysothamnus nauseosum) or desert peach (Prunus andersonii). Bitterbrush also was important forage for mule deer during winter. We hypothesized that mountain lions would be more successful at stalking and killing mule deer in habitats with more concealment cover than in habitats with less cover, and therefore mule deer would choose between foraging on bitterbush and avoiding predation by mountain lions. We collected data on habitat characteristics in 3 types of locations: random locations (n = 180), deer foraging locations (n = 179), and locations where mountain lions killed deer (n = 41). Mule deer selected habitat at greater elevations (P < 0.001) with more bitterbrush (P < 0.001) and less rabbitbrush (P = 0.033) when compared with random locations. Logistic regression indicated that mountain lions killed deer in relatively open areas with more desert Peach (P < 0.001) than at locations in which deer foraged. Therefore, deer were not confronted with a trade-off when selecting habitat on winter range, and they minimized the ratio of predation risk to forage benefit by selecting habitat with more bitterbrush. Changes in diet among seasons, which occur for herds of migratory deer, lead to individuals experiencing changing predation risk to forage benefit ratios throughout the year. Hence, migratory populations of mule deer likely adopt different strategies of habitat selection among seasons.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  112     Total Times Cited:  116     Cited Reference Count:  59 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.2193/0022-541X(2004)068[0533:HSBMDF]2.0.CO;2     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),California;forage;Great Basin Desert;Odocoileus hemianus;predation;Puma concolor;trade-offs;MOUNTAIN LION PREDATION;WHITE-TAILED DEER;SEXUAL SEGREGATION;BIGHORN SHEEP;PATTERNS;CONSEQUENCES;POPULATIONS;BEHAVIOR;COYOTES;CATTLE;Risk Assessment;Prednisolone,,

Anthropogenic presence and disturbance have the potential to shift interactions among predators and prey and the where and when encounters occur. We examined how white-tailed deer Odocoileus virginianus fawn spatiotemporal antipredator behaviour differed along an anthropogenic disturbance gradient that had black bears Ursus americanus, coyotes Canis latrans, bobcats Lynx rufus and humans present. We quantified (a) spatial co-occurrence in species distributions, (b) temporal overlap across the diel cycle and (c) spatiotemporal associations between humans, bears, coyotes, bobcats, adult male deer and fawns. We also examined how deer vigilance behaviour changed across the anthropogenic disturbance gradient and survey duration. Anthropogenic disturbance influenced spatiotemporal co-occurrence across multiple scales, often increasing spatiotemporal overlap among species. In general, species' spatial co-occurrence was neutral or positive in anthropogenically disturbed environments. Bears and fawns, coyotes and adult male deer, and bobcats and fawns all had higher temporal overlap in the agriculture-development matrix sites. In addition, factors that influenced deer vigilance (e.g. distance to forest edge and predator relative abundance) in the agriculture-development matrix sites did not in the forest matrix site. By taking into account the different antipredator behaviours that can be detected and the different scales these behaviours might occur, we were able to gain a more comprehensive picture of how humans reduce available niche space for wildlife, creating the neutral and positive spatiotemporal associations between species that studies have been seeing in more disturbed areas.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  69 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/1365-2656.13548     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),anthropogenic disturbance;multiple predators;predation risk;predator-prey interactions;risk allocation;spatiotemporal co-occurrence;vigilance;INTRAGUILD PREDATION;TEMPORAL VARIATION;ACTIVITY PATTERNS;EASTERN COYOTES;TOP PREDATORS;BLACK BEARS;SPACE USE;RISK;LANDSCAPE;RESPONSES;Humanities;Humanism;Humans;Prednisolone;Needles,,

The model arises from the study of a biological system involving arctic foxes (predator), lemmings (prey), and seal carcasses (subsidy). The positivity and asymptotically uniform boundedness of the solutions of the system have been derived. Analytically, we have studied the criteria for the feasibility and stability of different equilibrium points. In addition, we have derived sufficient conditions for the existence of local bifurcations of codimension 1 (transcritical and Hopf bifurcation). It is also observed that there is some time lag between the time of perceiving predator signals through vocal cues and the reduction of prey's birth rate. So, we have analyzed the dynamical behaviour of the delayed predator-prey-subsidy model. Numerical computations have been performed using MATLAB to validate all the analytical findings. Numerically, it has been observed that the predator, prey, and subsidy can always exist at a nonzero subsidy input rate. But, at a high subsidy input rate, the prey population cannot persist and the predator population has a huge growth due to the availability of food sources.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  4     Total Times Cited:  4     Cited Reference Count:  51 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Maybe""}",10.1155/2021/9963031     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),GENERALIST PREDATOR;ADDITIONAL FOOD;MODEL;IMPACT;Prednisolone,,

As predators respond strategically to prey behavior and vice versa, the model is based on a co-evolution approach. Focusing on the ""many eyes-many mouths"" trade-off, this model considers the benefits and costs of being in a group for hunting predators and foraging prey: predators in a group have more hunting success than solitary predators but they have to share the prey captured; prey in a group face a lower risk of predation but greater competition for resources than lone prey. The analysis of the model shows that the intersections of four curves define distinct areas in the parameter space, corresponding to different strategies used by predators and prey at equilibrium. The model predictions are in accordance with empirical evidence that an open habitat encourages group living, and that low risks of predation favor lone prey. Under some conditions, continuous cycling of the relative frequencies of the different strategies may occur. In this situation, the proportions of grouped vs. solitary predators and prey oscillate over time. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

Game-theoretic models of herd formation are developed based on different survival probabilities of solitary prey and prey that join the herd and on the predator's preference of what type of prey to search for. For an intentional predator that will only pursue its preferred type of prey, a single herd with no solitaries cannot emerge unless the herd acts as a prey refuge. If neither prey choice provides a refuge, it is shown that an equilibrium always exists where there are both types of prey and the predator does not always search for the same type of prey (i.e., a mixed equilibrium exists). On the other hand, if the predator is opportunistic in that it sometimes shifts to pursue the type of prey that is observed first, there may be a single herd equilibrium that does not act as a prey refuge when there is a high level of opportunistic behavior. For low opportunistic levels, a mixed equilibrium is again the only outcome. The evolutionary stability of each equilibrium is tested to see if it predicts the eventual herding behavior of prey in its corresponding model. Our analysis confirms that both predator and prey preferences (for herd or solitary) have strong effects on why prey aggregate. In particular, in our models, only the opportunistic predator can maintain all prey in a single herd that is under predation risk.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  18     Total Times Cited:  18     Cited Reference Count:  37 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1890/10-0199.1     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),dynamic stability;ESS;game theory;intentional predator;opportunistic predator;predation strategy;selfish herd;solitary prey;BANFF-NATIONAL-PARK;POPULATION-DYNAMICS;HABITAT SELECTION;FORAGING BEHAVIOR;HUNTING SUCCESS;GROUP-SIZE;WOLVES;RISK;ELK;LIONS;Prednisolone,,

Grouping provides antipredatory benefits, and therefore aggregation tendencies increase under heightened predation risk. In socially breeding groups, however, conflicts over reproductive shares or safety tend to disintegrate groups. Group formation thereby involves a balance between the antipredatory benefits of aggregation and the destabilizing effect of reproductive conflict.        2. We study the grouping behaviour of a facultatively social precocial sea duck with uniparental female care, the eider (Somateria mollissima Linnaeus). Females tend their young solitarily or in groups of 2-5 females. Here, we focus on the effect predation on adults has on group-formation decisions of brood-caring females.        3. By modifying an existing bidding game over care, we model the effects of predation risk on the width of the window of selfishness, which delimits the reproductive sharing allowing cooperation within brood-rearing coalitions, and generate predictions about the relative frequencies of solitary versus cooperative parental care modes. Furthermore, we model the dilution effect as a function of female group size and predation risk.        4. The window of selfishness widens with increasing predation risk, and the dilution of predation risk increases with both female group size and increasing predation risk, yielding the following predictions: (i) cooperative brood care becomes more prevalent and, conversely, solitary brood care less prevalent under heightened predation risk and (ii) group sizes increase concomitantly.        5. We tested these predictions using 13 years of data on female grouping decisions and annual predation rates, while controlling for the potentially confounding effect of female body condition.        6. Our data supported both predictions, where heightened predation risk of nesting females, but not changes in their condition, increased the relative frequency of cooperative brood care. Increased female nesting mortality also resulted in larger groups of cooperative females.        7. The predation risk of incubating females has long-term implications for later parental care decisions. We discuss the potential consequences of predation-induced shifts in group size on per capita fitness and population-wide productivity.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  33     Total Times Cited:  34     Cited Reference Count:  55 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/j.1365-2656.2010.01757.x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),dilution effect;eider;group formation;long-term data;modelling;offspring survival;Somateria mollissima;theory;EIDER SOMATERIA-MOLLISSIMA;TUG-OF-WAR;BROOD-REARING COALITIONS;REPRODUCTIVE SKEW THEORY;FEMALE COMMON EIDERS;NEST-SITE SELECTION;CLUTCH SIZE;ECOLOGICAL CONSTRAINTS;MISSING MODEL;EVOLUTION;Adult;Prednisolone,,

Rodents exhibit a diverse suite of antipredator behaviors that have been examined in both field and laboratory studies. However, the results from the laboratory have not always translated to the field. While laboratory studies consistently indicate strong fear-inducing effects of cat fur/skin odors, it is unclear whether this occurs in the field with wild rats. To address this issue, we tested the antipredator responses of wild brown rats (Rattus norvegicus) to predatory (domestic cat fur) and nonpredatory (common brushtail possum fur) odor cues in a semi-natural experimental paradigm. Rats were housed in open air enclosures containing two feeding stations. Following several nights of acclimatization, the feeding stations were paired with cat fur, possum fur, or no fur. Rats spent less time at a feeding station that was paired with cat fur. Duration of time spent at feeding stations increased across consecutive test days and across hours within individual test nights, although the rate of increase within nights was lower for cat fur paired stations. This overall increase might reflect habituation of antipredator behaviors, increasing hunger, or loss of cue potency over time. We suggest that wild brown rats recognize and respond to cat fur odor cues, but their behavioral response is highly adaptable and finely tuned to the trade-off between predation risk and starvation that occurs across short temporal scales.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  78 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1093/beheco/arab038     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),antipredator;behavior;cat odor;foraging;rodents;predation risk;PREDATOR ODORS;BREEDING SUPPRESSION;DEFENSIVE RESPONSES;RISK;FEAR;BEHAVIOR;RATTUS;VOLES;FIELD;MICE;Cats;Rats,,

Mathematical method: We use a differential equation model to describe disease dynamics in two habitats coupled by natal dispersal and use an evolutionary game theoretical approach to calculate the evolutionarily stable strategy for habitat choice.        Key assumptions: Natal dispersal by offspring with ideal knowledge of habitats. Habitats differ only in resource quality. Fecundity is proportional to intake rate, which decreases with density. We assume density-dependent disease transmission, with infection reducing fecundity or lifespan. Disease may be present in both habitats or the high-quality habitat only.        Conclusions: In the absence of disease, our model predicts input matching (i.e. the distribution of individuals matches the distribution of resource inputs). The negative fitness consequences of infection can result in undermatching (underuse of the high-quality habitat compared with input matching), but stable overmatching (overuse of the high-quality habitat) is never predicted. Increasing the risk of transmission increases the degree of observed undermatching when only the high-quality habitat is infected but reduces undermatching when both habitats present a risk of disease. Increasing the cost of infection by reducing fecundity reduces use of the high-quality habitat (undermatching) in both cases. Increasing the cost of infection by increasing mortality rates also reduces the use of the high-quality habitat when both habitats are infected; if only the high-quality habitat is infected, undermatching may initially increase with mortality but eventually decreases.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  1     Total Times Cited:  1     Cited Reference Count:  68 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",,habitat selection;ideal free distribution;infectious disease transmission;undermatching;IDEAL FREE DISTRIBUTION;FREE DISTRIBUTIONS;GREAT TIT;PREDATION;PARASITES;PREY;BEHAVIOR;DENSITY;CHOICE;TRANSMISSION;Communicable Diseases,,

Because few studies of waiting games have focused on mammals, we studied the hiding behavior of the yellow-bellied marmot (Marmota flaviventris), a ground-dwelling rodent. We tested the prediction that marmots vary hiding time as a function of predator approach speed and presence and absence of food outside their refuge and that marmots hide differently depending on their relative condition. We conducted ""fast approaches"" and ""slow approaches"" in the presence and absence of extra food and evaluated hiding times. Multiple regression analyses demonstrated that the interaction between the approach speed and the presence and absence of food influenced hiding behavior; body condition had a smaller, but nonsignificant effect. We then developed a state-dependent dynamic model to explore potential fitness consequences of these decisions. The model suggested that the overall survival of a population is substantially reduced when individuals make suboptimal decisions.

As such, predation is considered one of the most pervasive selective pressures affecting individual fitness. But what performance characteristics enable individuals to escape predation? Intuitively, we expect faster individuals to be better at avoiding predation, and studies of animal performance have almost exclusively focused on the role of maximal speeds during escape from predators. However, focusing on maximal performance vastly oversimplifies the dynamics between predators and prey. In reality, an individual's escape performance is likely to be defined by both their speed and ability to rapidly change directions or maneuverability. We tested this idea using a custom, tablet-based game that simulated encounters between predator and prey. We conducted 2 experiments in which human subjects were asked to capture simulated on-screen prey by touching them as they moved across the tablet's display; with prey varying in size, speed, and maneuverability. Using these data, we were able to quantify how the function describing speed and the probability of escape differed from the relationship between maneuverability and the probability of escape. Importantly, variation in these functions would mean that small increases in speed would translate to escape success in different ways to small increases in maneuverability, and understanding these functions is essential for predicting the evolution of escape performance and its associated morphologies. We found that escape success was determined by both speed and maneuverability-slow prey could still escape predation when highly maneuverable, whereas prey that were poorly maneuverable could only escape when fast. As small changes in speed translated into escape success in a different way to changes in maneuverability, our results highlight the importance of including both speed and maneuverability in tests of animal escape performance. Taken together, our data of simulated predator-prey interactions can be used to guide further theoretical and empirical studies exploring the evolution and conservation implications of predator-prey interactions.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  26     Total Times Cited:  26     Cited Reference Count:  44 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1093/beheco/arv080     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),locomotion;performance;predation;PREDATION RISK;LOCOMOTOR PERFORMANCE;HABITAT SELECTION;FORAGING STRATEGY;PREY;BODY;FITNESS;LIZARDS;FISH;COMPENSATION,,

Cyprinus carpio dorsal and pectoral spines were longer and body depth was deeper when predators were more abundant, with differences becoming more pronounced from July to October. To determine if morphological plasticity successfully reduced predation risk, prey selection of largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides foraging on deep- and shallow-bodied C. carpio was evaluated in open and vegetated environments. Predators typically selected deep- over shallow-bodied phenotypes in open habitats and neutrally selected both phenotypes in vegetated habitats. When exposed to predators, shallow-bodied C. carpio phenotypes shoaled in open habitat, whereas deep-bodied phenotypes occupied vegetation. Although deep-bodied phenotypes required additional handling time, shallow-bodied phenotypes were more difficult to capture. These results suggest that juvenile C. carpio gradually develop deeper bodies and larger spines as predation risk increases.

But because the relevant traits may be difficult to manipulate and fitness difficult to assess, proxy variables linked to conflict intensity may provide important tools for empirical measurement. Here we identify two common types of sexual conflict-one within mating pairs over the less expensive male role, and one between mating pairs and intruders seeking to obtain fertilizations-and consider how they vary in intensity along gradients of population density and predation risk. To do this, we develop and analyze a model of mating dynamics in the chalk bass, an egg-trading simultaneous hermaphrodite that lives on Caribbean coral reefs. In this species, within-pair sexual conflict leads each female-role partner to provide in each mating episode only a subset (parcel) of its egg clutch to its mate for fertilization. Pair-intruder sexual conflict (i.e., sperm competition) increases the proportion of the gonad allocated to male function. In the model, more parceling and greater male allocation both resulted in lower fitness at the ESS, our measure of conflict intensity. Male allocation increased along the density gradient but decreased along the predation-risk gradient, reflecting shifts in intrusion frequency. Parcel number sharply increased and then decreased more gradually along a gradient of increasing local density, initially responding to increased availability of alternative mates across low densities and then to diminishing clutch size toward higher densities. Parcel number decreased with predation risk as each mating episode became more dangerous. Conflict intensities were usually greatest at intermediate positions along the two environmental gradients, and each conflict ameliorated the intensity of the other. Overall, parceling and sex allocation may be good though imperfect proxies for intensities of within-pair and pair-intruder sexual conflicts among chalk bass.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  5     Total Times Cited:  5     Cited Reference Count:  81 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s10682-010-9459-1     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Evolutionary game theory;Mating systems;Reciprocity;Egg parceling;Sex allocation;Simultaneous hermaphrodite;Serranus tortugarum;MALE MATING SUCCESS;CORAL-REEF FISH;SIMULTANEOUS HERMAPHRODITES;EVOLUTIONARY STABILITY;REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS;MEDITERRANEAN WRASSE;POPULATION-DENSITY;CHALK BASS;ALLOCATION;SELECTION;Ovum;Prednisolone,,

Yet, forecasting the propagation of these predator-induced trait changes through particular communities remains a challenge. Accordingly, focusing on plasticity in prey anti-predator behaviours, we conceptualise the multi-stage process by which predators trigger direct and indirect NCEs, review and distil potential drivers of contingencies into three key categories (properties of the prey, predator and setting), and then provide a general framework for predicting both the nature and strength of direct NCEs. Our review underscores the myriad factors that can generate NCE contingencies while guiding how research might better anticipate and account for them. Moreover, our synthesis highlights the value of mapping both habitat domains and prey-specific patterns of evasion success ('evasion landscapes') as the basis for predicting how direct NCEs are likely to manifest in any particular community. Looking ahead, we highlight two key knowledge gaps that continue to impede a comprehensive understanding of non-consumptive predator-prey interactions and their ecosystem consequences; namely, insufficient empirical exploration of (1) context-dependent indirect NCEs and (2) the ways in which direct and indirect NCEs are shaped interactively by multiple drivers of context dependence.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  23     Total Times Cited:  24     Cited Reference Count:  156 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/ele.13614     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Anti-predator behaviour;contingency;escape;evasion landscape;habitat domain;hunting mode;predation risk;predator-prey interactions;risk effects;top-down effects;trade-offs;WHITE-TAILED DEER;PATCH USE;ANTIPREDATOR BEHAVIOR;PREY INTERACTIONS;FORAGING BEHAVIOR;HABITAT USE;TROPHIC CASCADES;TIME ALLOCATION;HUNTING MODE;PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY;Prednisolone,,

Theory suggests that fear responses may be either higher in areas with high disturbance (disturbance avoidance) or lower in such areas (e.g. due to habituation). We used flight initiation distance (FID) to study how fear responses of 16 bird species varied with distance from villages (range 0.1-11.6 km) within the Ramsar site of Kilombero Valley, Tanzania. A linear model indicated that FID was not related to distance from villages, but varied between habitats. However, a piecewise linear model (linear response up to 2 km, flat response > 2 km from villages) provided a better fit and suggested that there may be a small decrease in FID close to human settlements, in particular for the Common Bulbul (Pycnonotus barbatus) and a few other species, although the majority of species still showed little change in FID with distance from human settlements. Our results suggest that a few species may respond to human disturbance with a decreased FID, whereas the majority of species showed little variation in FID in relation to distance from human settlements, and may therefore be negatively affected by increasing frequency of human disturbance.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  13     Total Times Cited:  13     Cited Reference Count:  45 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s10336-014-1121-1     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Birds;Fear response;Flight initiation distance;Habituation;Human disturbance;HUMAN DISTURBANCE;KILOMBERO VALLEY;PREDATION RISK;ANTIPREDATOR BEHAVIOR;TOLERANCE;URBAN;RESPONSES;MANAGEMENT;FEAR;Humanities;Humanism;Humans,,

Retaliatory persecution such as poisoning threatens predators, but also non-target biota. Several factors influence conflict severity, including livestock husbandry, overlap in seasonal habitat use, and the degree to which livestock perceive and are able to respond to a landscape of fear. We investigated these factors by GPS-tracking 42 Tswana beef cattle (Bos taunts) from 29 herds in 2017 and six lions (Panthera leo) from different prides (May 2016-Dec. 2017) in the northern Okavango Delta, Botswana, where cattle depredation significantly impacts the livelihoods of rural agro-pastoralists. Cattle exhibited seasonal habitat selection patterns similar to wild ungulates in the region. They preferred woodland habitats, with more digestible grasses, during the wet season. During the dry season, they preferred wetland habitats with reliable forage and water availability. Cattle also preferred areas close to human settlements, but the necessity to forage in wetlands during the dry season exposed them to significant depredation risk, especially > 4 km from settlements. Lions killed most cattle in wetlands during the late dry season but the intensity of recent lion presence (previous 14 days) only had a weak negative effect on cattle habitat selection patterns. Cattle used rangelands according to nutritional requirements, irrelevant of the associated predation risk, suggesting that socio-ecologically acceptable conflict solutions cannot rely on the exclusion of livestock from seasonal wetlands. Curbing depredation by lions will best be achieved by a combination of resource- and predation-cognisant seasonal herding strategies with adequate livestock protection. Understanding the ecological constraints that intensify conflict is pertinent to any livestock production landscape with predator presence. It is also a central prerequisite for future land use planning and devolution of legal, controlled resource access rights through policy. Coexistence strategies must account for the strong reliance of people, their livestock, and wildlife on shared key resources. This is particularly important In large trans-frontier conservation areas where the successful merging of biodiversity conservation and rural development is a strategic goal. Omission will foster resentment and resistance to coexistence with apex predators, particularly if livestock productivity and human livelihoods are negatively affected.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  4     Total Times Cited:  4     Cited Reference Count:  77 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.biocon.2019.06.031     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Coexistence;Functional resource heterogeneity;Habitat quality;Landscape of fear;Livestock;Okavango Delta;Panthera leo;Predation risk;Water availability;SPATIOTEMPORAL VARIATIONS;BEHAVIORAL-ADJUSTMENTS;LARGE CARNIVORE;PREDATION RISK;AFRICAN LIONS;NATIONAL-PARK;PANTHERA-LEO;CONSERVATION;LIVESTOCK;WILDLIFE;Cattle;Seasons,,

Nat.,144,2,317-328,"ABRAMS, PA",,English,,,"Mathematical models are used to determine the optimal foraging effort of individuals that face increased risk of predation when they exert greater foraging effort but have imperfect information about the degree of risk. If the fitness cost of underestimating predation risk is less than that of overestimating risk, imperfect information should lead to behavior that is appropriate for a lesser risk than is actually present. Overestimation is favored under the opposite condition. If there is a trade-off between starvation and predation, an animal will usually underestimate (overestimate) risk if the third derivative of the starvation-versus-risk relation is positive (negative), provided uncertainty is not too large. Different, plausible starvation functions can favor either under- or overestimates of risk. If there is a trade-off between reproduction and predation, a more complex condition determines which type of bias is adaptive; this condition involves the reproduction-versus-risk function and its first three derivatives, and again, over- or underestimation of risk can be advantageous. In almost all models, increased accuracy of estimation is favored when costs of increased accuracy are sufficiently small. These results differ from those of previous analyses, and reasons for these differences are discussed.

However, our current understanding of these trade-offs is limited in one key respect: we know little about the behavior of predators. In this study, we provide some of the first detailed information on temporal patterns in the daily hunting behavior of bird-eating Accipiter hawks and relate that to their prey. During the winters of 1999-2004, twenty-one sharp-shinned hawks (A. striatus) and ten Cooper's hawks (A. cooperii) were intensively radio tracked in rural and urban habitats in western Indiana, USA. Cooper's hawks left roost before sunrise and usually returned to roost around sunset, while sharp-shinned hawks left roost at sunrise or later and returned to roost well before sunset. An overall measure of Cooper's-hawk-induced risk (a composite variable of attack rate and activity patterns) generally reflected the timing of prey activity, with peaks occurring around sunrise and sunset. In contrast, risk induced by the smaller sharp-shinned hawk did not strongly reflect the activity of their prey. Specifically, an early morning peak in prey activity did not correspond to a period with intense hawk activity. The lack of early morning hunting by sharp-shinned hawks may reflect the high risk of owl-induced predation experienced by these hawks. The net effect of this intraguild predation may be to ""free"" small birds from much hawk-induced predation risk prior to sunrise. This realization presents an alternative to energetics as an explanation for the early morning peak in small bird activity during the winter.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  43     Total Times Cited:  44     Cited Reference Count:  56 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s00442-006-0638-2     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),activity patterns;Cooper's hawk;foraging game;predator-prey interactions;sharp-shinned hawk;DECISION-MAKING;BIRDS;RISK;SIZE;REDSHANKS;DYNAMICS;ROUTINES;STRATEGY;ECOLOGY;GAMES;Prednisolone,,

While the benefits of familiarity for locating resources have been reported previously, the potential value of familiarity for predation avoidance has been accorded less attention. It has been suggested that familiarity should be beneficial for anti-predator behaviour when direct cues of predation risk are unclear and do not allow prey to identify well-defined spatial refuges. However, to our knowledge, this hypothesis has yet to be tested.        Here, we assessed how site familiarity, measured as the intensity of use of a given location, is associated with the probability of roe deer Capreolus capreolus being killed by two predators with contrasting hunting tactics, the Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx and human hunters. While risk of human hunting was confined to open habitats, risk of lynx predation was more diffuse, with no clear refuge areas.        We estimated cause-specific mortality rates in a competing risk framework for 212 GPS-collared roe deer in two ecologically distinct areas of Central Europe to test the hypothesis that the daily risk of being killed by lynx or hunters should be lower in areas of high familiarity.        We found strong evidence that site familiarity reduces the risk of being predated by lynx, whereas the evidence that the risk of being hunted is linked to site familiarity was weak.        We suggest that local knowledge about small-scale differences in predation risk and information about efficient escape routes affect an individual's ability to avoid or escape an attack by an ambush predator. Our study emphasizes the role of site familiarity in determining the susceptibility of prey to predation. Further research will be required to understand better how a cognitive map of individual spatial information is beneficial for avoiding predation in the arms race that drives the predator-prey shell game.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  17     Total Times Cited:  17     Cited Reference Count:  66 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/1365-2656.13202     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),home range;hunting;lynx;movement;prey;roe deer;site fidelity;survival analysis;LYNX LYNX-LYNX;EURASIAN LYNX;HABITAT SELECTION;ROE DEER;SPATIAL MEMORY;OWL PREDATION;MOVEMENT;BEHAVIOR;SPACE;LANDSCAPE;Prednisolone,,

For example, efforts have been made to evaluate indirect effects on prairie grouse survival, but it is also critical to investigate the underlying mechanisms to direct conservation strategies. The objective of this study was to investigate the indirect effects of a wind energy facility on the survival of female Greater Prairie-Chickens (Tympanuchus cupido pinnatus) and on the occupancy of avian and mammalian predators. Between March and July of 2013 and 2014, we investigated spatial variation in predation risk by sampling occupancy of mammalian and avian predators within 10 km of a wind energy facility constructed in 2005 in Brown County, Nebraska, USA. During the same period, we assessed spatial variation in daily survival of radio-marked females within the same area. We found little evidence that probability of site occupancy (Psi) of avian predators was lower near the wind energy facility (within 2 km: Psi = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.22-0.95; beyond 2 km: Psi = 0.93, 95% CI = 0.02-1.00), suggesting that avian predators did not display local-scale avoidance behavior around wind turbines. Mammalian predators were documented at all of our sample locations, but the capture index for all mammals was lower at sample sites near the wind turbines (P = 0.004). Occupancy of coyotes (Canis latrans), the likely main mammalian predator of adult prairie-chickens in the area, did not vary significantly throughout our study site (within 0.5 km of wind energy facility: Psi = 0.65, 95% CI = 0.07-0.98; beyond 0.5 km: Psi = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.04-1.00), although trends were in the direction expected if coyotes were avoiding the wind energy facility. Distance to wind turbine had no effect on daily survival (S-D) of female prairie-chickens (S-D = 0.9948, S-E = 0.0015). The potential for predators to avoid wind energy facilities, and thus affect predation risk, underscores the complexity of planning to address potential impacts of wind energy as variation in predation risk may have consequences for the population viability of a wide range of species at risk from wind energy development.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  6     Total Times Cited:  6     Cited Reference Count:  57 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1002/ecs2.1835     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),demography;Greater Prairie-Chicken;Nebraska;occupancy;prairie grouse;predator;renewable energy;Sandhills;Tympanuchus;Tympanuchus cupido pinnatus;wind farm;SAGE-GROUSE;UNIFIED APPROACH;HOME-RANGE;LANDSCAPE;MOVEMENTS;GRADIENT;BEHAVIOR;TURBINES;RAPTORS;COYOTES;Chickens;Prednisolone,,

While such a response is thought to reduce the future predation risk for responding species, there is surprisingly little empirical evidence to support this hypothesis. One way to test the link between predation risk reduction and mobbing attraction involves testing the relationship between species' attraction to mobbing calls and the functional traits that define their vulnerability to predation risk. Two important traits known to influence prey vulnerability include relative prey-to-predator body size ratio and the overlap in space use between predator and prey; in combination, these measures strongly influence prey accessibility, and therefore their vulnerability, to predators. Here, we combine community surveys with behavioral experiments of a diverse bird assemblage in the lowland rainforest of Sumatra to test whether the functional traits of body mass (representing body size) and foraging height (representing space use) can predict species' attraction to heterospecific mobbing calls. At four forest sites along a gradient of forest degradation, we characterized the resident bird communities using point count and mist-netting surveys, and determined the species groups attracted to standardized playbacks of mobbing calls produced by five resident bird species of roughly similar body size and foraging height. We found that (1) a large, diverse subcommunity of bird species was attracted to the mobbing calls and (2) responding species (especially the most vigorous respondents) tended to be (a) small (b) mid-storey foragers (c) with similar trait values as the species producing the mobbing calls. Our findings from the relatively lesser known bird assemblages of tropical Asia add to the growing evidence for the ubiquity of heterospecific information networks in animal communities, and provide empirical support for the long-standing hypothesis that predation risk reduction is a major benefit of mobbing information networks.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  12     Total Times Cited:  12     Cited Reference Count:  44 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1002/ece3.2545     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),functional traits;mobbing;predation risk;social information;tropical rainforest;ALARM CALLS;ECOLOGY;PREY;VULNERABILITY;MECHANISMS;PREDATORS;ALLOMETRY,,

Because, in an uncertain food chain model, the biological parameters can't be determined accurately. The aim of this work is to study the stability and local bifurcations (Saddle-node bifurcation, Hopf bifurcation and Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation) of an imprecise prey-predator system in an uncertain environment. The proposed imprecise model is formulated by considering two more realistic factors: the effect of a fear factor on the growth rate of prey population and non-linear harvesting of predator population. To study the proposed imprecise system mathematically, the dynamical interactions between the imprecise species are presented by the system of governing interval differential equations. And to study the dynamics of the proposed imprecise system theoretically, it is modelled in a precise way by the linear parametric representation of the interval. Then all the theoretical analyses, including Saddle-node bifurcation, Hopf bifurcation and Bogdanov-Takens (BT) bifurcation of the interior equilibrium point of the proposed imprecise model are discussed in parametric form. To verify all the theoretical analyses of the proposed imprecise model, numerical simulations with interval-valued hypothetical data of the imprecise parameters are performed graphically. Finally, the work is concluded with some biological consequences. (C) 2021 International Association for Mathematics and Computers in Simulation (IMACS). Published by Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, a cooperative defence game against a predator is introduced which is based on Hamilton's selfish herd theory and Eshel's survival game models. Cooperation is altruistic in the sense that the individual, which is not the target of the predator, helps the members of the group attacked by the predator and during defensive action the helper individual may also die in any attack. In order to decrease the long term predation risk, this individual has to carry out a high risk action. Here I show that this kind of cooperative behaviour can evolve in small groups. The reason for the emergence of cooperation is that if the predator does not kill a mate of a cooperative individual, then the survival probability of the cooperative individual will increase in two cases. If the mate is non-cooperative, then-according to the dilution effect, the predator confusion effect and the higher predator vigilance-the survival probability of the cooperative individual increases. The second case is when the mate is cooperative, because a cooperative individual has a further gain, the active help in defence during further predator attacks. Thus, if an individual can increase the survival rate of its mates (no matter whether the mate is cooperative or not), then its own predation risk will decrease. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

An excellent example is provided by the guppy, Poecilia reticulata, a species that has a promiscuous mating system in which female choice plays an important role. Males engage almost continuously in courtship behaviour but, as females are sexually receptive for short periods only, most male displays are ignored and sneaky mating attempts avoided. Experiments on guppies from wild Trinidad populations reveal that females appear to perceive themselves to be at a greater risk of predation and devote more time to anti-predator behaviour, for example, schooling when threatened. Inspections of the predator are also mainly initiated and led by female guppies. Males exploit this behaviour switch by increasing their sneaky mating attempts. A game theoretical analysis is used to explore the sexual asymmetry in mating cost and predation risk. Together these approaches show that there is no intersexual cooperation during predator inspection behaviour in this species, and may explain the paradoxical increase in mating activity by male guppies under threat.

The temporal scale of risk heterogeneity affects behavioral responses and determines the usefulness of metrics to quantify them. We present a conceptual framework to link anti-predator responses to risk fluctuations and appropriate metrics, based on temporal scale. We applied this framework to investigate movement responses of roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) to hunting risk, measured using movement rate and home range size. Because movements are also affected by reproductive phases, we considered potential effects of the rut in parallel to hunting risk. We compared movements of male and female roe deer in a protected site versus 2 hunted sites during and outside the hunting season and rut. We detected differences in movement rates in response to different hunting management practices. We did not detect effects for hunting regimes or between sexes during the rut when using home range size as the response variable. During the hunting season, movement rates were lower in the hunted sites than in the protected site, irrespective of sex. We did not observe differences in movement rates among sites outside of the hunting season. Males had higher movement rates than females during the rut in only 1 site. Our findings supported the hypothesis that roe deer decrease movements when exposed to high hunting risk. The effect of the rut on movements was negligible except for 1 study site. We suggest that movement rate is a more useful metric than home range size for assessing movement responses to hunting.

(2016, 2018) describing the dynamic outcomes arising from the interactions between patients and physicians, whose behavior is subject to clinical and legal risks. In particular, Antoci et al. (2016) analyzed the case of positive defensive medicine, while Antoci et al. (2018) dealt with the case of negative defensive medicine. We show that, when the models admit a nonisochronous center, it is possible to prove the existence of chaotic dynamics for the Poincare map associated with those systems via the method of Linked Twist Maps (LTMs). To such aim we exploit in both frameworks, using a similar rationale, the periodic dependence on time of a model parameter influencing the position of the center and describing some risk associated with certain medical interventions, whose seasonal variation is empirically grounded. We also recall the ecological interpretation of the same model proposed by Harvie et al. (2007) and connected with intraspecific competition and environmental carrying capacity in predator-prey settings. In this case, it is sensible to assume a seasonal variation both for the carrying capacities and for the intrinsic growth rates of the two populations. Although such parameters influence the shape of the orbits, but do not affect the center position, we show that it is still possible to prove the existence of chaotic dynamics for the associated Poincare map via the LTMs technique dealing with a different geometrical configuration for orbits in the phase plane.

Several studies on trait-mediated indirect interactions (TMIIs) have shown that predators can initiate trophic cascades by altering prey behaviour. Although it is well recognized that individual prey state alters antipredator and foraging behaviour, few studies explore whether this state-dependent prey behaviour can alter the strength of the ensuing tritrophic cascade. Here, we link state-dependent individual behaviour to community processes by experimentally testing whether hunger level and body size of prey altered antipredator behaviour and thus changed the strength of trophic cascades between predators and primary producers.        2. In rocky intertidal tide pools on the California Coast, waterborne cues from the predatory seastar Leptasterias spp. (Stimpson) can cause the herbivorous snail Tegula (Chlorostoma) funebralis (A. Adams) to reduce grazing and flee tide pools, resulting in positive indirect effects on tide pool microalgae.        3. However, we show that the strength of this behaviourally-mediated cascade may be contingent on prey hunger level and body size. During short field experiments at low tide, medium-sized snails that were either newly collected from the field or fed for 1 week in the laboratory mediated strong TMIIs because they grazed less when seastars were present. In contrast, no TMIIs occurred when medium-sized snails had been starved for 1 week because they continued grazing regardless of seastar presence. Newly collected small snails fled from seastars but did not mediate cascades because they ate little algae. Despite reaching an apparent size refuge from predation, many newly collected large snails fled from seastars, but those individuals that remained tended to graze the algae more quickly, resulting in unexpected negative indirect effects of seastars on algae cover. The implication of this pattern for the natural system is unclear.        4. Because average hunger level and size of snails vary over time and space in nature, a mosaic of TMII strength may exist.        5. Overall, the strength of tritrophic TMIIs in tide pools depended on individual prey state, supporting model predictions and adding to sparse empirical evidence. This outcome suggests that patterns occurring system-wide over the long term may be influenced by the state-dependent decisions made by the individuals present.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  22     Total Times Cited:  22     Cited Reference Count:  54 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/1365-2435.12628     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),adaptive foraging theory;antipredator behaviour;Leptasterias;nonconsumptive effect;predator-prey interaction;Tegula funebralis;trait-mediated indirect interaction;trophic cascade;RELEVANT ORGANIZATIONAL SCALE;ECOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES;LATITUDINAL VARIATION;LINKING INDIVIDUALS;COMMUNITY ECOLOGY;TROPHIC CASCADES;FORAGING THEORY;PREDATION RISK;MARINE SNAIL;TRADE-OFF,,

We tested this hypothesis using GPS locations collected simultaneously from moose (Alces alces) and wolves (Canis lupus) in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem of North America. We assessed shifts in the speed, displacement, and habitat selection of moose 24 h following encounter with wolves (0-1,500 m distance). We examined whether the strength of antipredator behaviors would weaken as winter progressed and the nutritional condition of moose declined. Moose responded to wolf encounters by increasing their rate of movement in early winter, but only within 500 m distance. Importantly, these responses attenuated as winter progressed. Moose did not avoid their preferred foraging habitat (riparian areas) following encounters with wolves at any distance, and instead they more strongly selected riparian areas, especially in early winter. Our findings support theoretical predictions that resource deficits should dampen prey antipredator behavior, and suggest that nutritional condition of prey may buffer against run-away risk effects in food webs involving large mammalian predators and prey.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  10     Total Times Cited:  10     Cited Reference Count:  55 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1002/ecy.2618     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),bottom up;context dependence;moose;predation risk;predator avoidance;top down;ungulate;winter;wolf;HABITAT SELECTION;BEHAVIORAL-RESPONSES;PREDATION RISK;PREY;ELK;MOOSE;POPULATION;STRENGTH;WOLVES;INTIMIDATION,,

As roads often have a negative effect on populations of birds and mammals, their effects are important for wildlife management. However, the effect of roads differ between different types of roads, and most studies of road ecology have focused on major roads with high traffic intensity, whilst effects of smaller unpaved forest roads in northern ecosystems are less known. We investigated the effects of forest roads in a mixed conifer forest in central Europe on cervid habitat use and browsing impact on forest regeneration during the winter season. We found that hunted cervid species avoided forest roads, and that browsing pressure was higher within the core of forest areas rather than close to roads. This led to an increased density of undamaged trees (by browsing) close to forest roads, whilst browsing damages were relatively high in the interior. Hunters often use these forest roads in the hunting season. We suggest that human disturbance creates corridors of fear along forest roads, and that cervids alter their habitat and browse use to avoid humans. This in turn has implications for forest and cervid management. This is the first study to document that gravel roads can affect oak trees through modifying cervid behavior. Future studies should use experiments to explore this question further and separate different effects of forest roads to understand the mechanisms; edge effects on vegetation, traffic, effects on natural predators and human disturbance.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  9     Total Times Cited:  9     Cited Reference Count:  59 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.foreco.2018.04.057     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Deer;Oak;Damage;Fear;Hunters;Edge;YELLOWSTONE-NATIONAL-PARK;PREDATION RISK;ROE DEER;BEHAVIORAL-RESPONSES;WOLVES;MOOSE;FEAR;ELK;LANDSCAPE;SELECTION;Trees,,

Blue monkeys (Cercopithecus mitis) are forest-glade edge species, whereas Olive baboons (Papio anubis) prefer the open grassland of the glade interior. In this study, scan sampling was used to record the presence and absence of each species, group sizes and individual behaviours in three glade types in Mount Meru Game Reserve, Tanzania. Glade characteristics and primate usage for the three glade types were studied: five man-made, fifteen lower natural and five upper natural glades. During 200 (3-h morning and afternoon) observation periods, Blue monkeys and Olive baboons were observed during 43% (86/200) and 31% (62/200) of the observation periods, respectively. Blue monkeys used upper natural glades more than man-made and lower natural; Olive baboons used man-made glades more than lower and upper natural. Differences in glade type, in regard to vegetation, altitude and disturbance due to trail routes, influenced gladetype use and species behaviours. In conclusion, although the management practice of clearing in and around man-made glades provides no direct conservation value for Blue monkeys, it likely reduces overuse of natural glades and human-wildlife conflict by enhancing plant species richness and diversity important to Olive baboons.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  39 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/aje.12195     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Blue monkeys;forest-glade edge;glade;glade edge and glade interior;Olive baboons;CERCOPITHECUS-MITIS;PREDATOR DETECTION;HABITAT USE;AVAILABILITY;BEHAVIOR;DENSITY;EDGES;RISK;Papio;Haplorhini,,

Analyses differentiated hunters and trappers. Beliefs about risks and benefits partially explained the relationship between attitudes and wolf management preferences among hunters, while risk-based beliefs fully accounted for management preferences in the trapper sample. Beliefs about risks associated with wolves were most strongly related to management preferences among both hunters and trappers. Beliefs about the risks wolves present to desired game species may be symbolic among hunters and trappers, therefore, managers may be challenged to gain support for recovering wolf populations among these stakeholders.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  7     Total Times Cited:  7     Cited Reference Count:  48 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1080/10871209.2018.1511876     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Gray wolves;hunters;management;predators;salient beliefs;CARNIVORE CONSERVATION;WOLVES;TOLERANCE;WILDLIFE;ACCEPTANCE;WISCONSIN;SWEDEN;STATES;BEARS;WILL;Risk Assessment;Minnesota,,

To maximize lifetime fitness, prey must be able to optimize energy gain and minimize predation risk, and responses to current levels of risk may be influenced by background levels of risk. A 'risk allocation' model has recently been proposed to predict the intensity of antipredator responses that should occur as predation risk varies over time. Prey animals from high-risk environments should respond to predators with relatively low intensities of antipredator behaviour because long periods of antipredator behaviour may result in unacceptable decreases in levels of foraging activity. Moreover, animals that are under frequent risk should devote more energy to foraging during brief pulses of safety compared with animals under infrequent attack. In this study, we experimentally tested the risk allocation hypothesis. We exposed juvenile rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, to three levels of risk (high, moderate and low) crossed with two levels of temporal variation (exposed to risk three times a day and once a day). In accordance with the model, we found that trout exposed to risky situations more frequently responded with significantly less intense antipredator behaviour than trout exposed to risk infrequently. The intensity of response of trout exposed to moderate risk three times a day decreased to levels similar to situations of no risk. However, in contrast to the second prediction of the model, animals under frequent risk were not more active during periods of safety compared with animals under infrequent risk. Although behaviour in the face of predation risk was dependent on the broader temporal context in which risk varied, the specific predictions of the risk allocation model were only partly supported.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  50     Total Times Cited:  50     Cited Reference Count:  30 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/j.1439-0310.2006.01111.x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),CHEMICAL STIMULI;ALARM PHEROMONE;BEHAVIOR;MINNOW;EXPERIENCE;AVOIDANCE;GROWTH;WILD;Prednisolone,,

Such generalization of predator recognition may be particularly beneficial when prey are exposed to introduced and invasive species of predators or hybrids. Here, we examined generalization of predator recognition for woodfrog tadpoles exposed to novel trout predators. Tadpoles conditioned to recognize tiger trout, a hybrid derived from brown trout and brook trout, showed generalization of recognition of several unknown trout odours. Interestingly, the tadpoles showed stronger responses to odours of brown trout than brook trout. In a second experiment, we found that tadpoles trained to recognize brown trout showed stronger responses to tiger trout than those tadpoles trained to recognize brook trout. Given that tiger trout always have a brown trout mother and a brook trout father, these results suggest a strong maternal signature in trout odours. Tadpoles that were trained to recognize both brown trout and brook trout showed stronger response to novel tiger trout than those trained to recognize only brown trout or only brook trout. This is consistent with a peak shift in recognition, whereby cues that are intermediate between two known cues evoke stronger responses than either known cue. Given that our woodfrog tadpoles have no evolutionary or individual experience with trout, they have no way of knowing whether or not brook trout, brown trout or tiger trout are more dangerous. The differential intensity of responses that we observed to hybrid trout cues and each of the parental species indicates that there is a likely mismatch between risk and anti-predator response intensity. Future work needs to address the critical role of prey naivety on responses to invasive and introduced hybrid predators.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  9     Total Times Cited:  9     Cited Reference Count:  42 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1098/rspb.2015.0365     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),learning;predator recognition;risk assessment;generalization;hybrid predators;invasive species;THREAT-SENSITIVE GENERALIZATION;ANTIPREDATOR BEHAVIOR;INTERSPECIFIC HYBRIDIZATION;CONFLICTING INFORMATION;TEMPORAL VARIATION;SALMONID FISH;RECOGNITION;RISK;AVOIDANCE;SURVIVAL;Prednisolone,,

According to risk-sensitive foraging theory, animals should make foraging decisions that balance nutritional costs and gains to promote fitness. Human disturbance is a form of perceived risk that can prompt avoidance of risky habitat over acquisition of food. Consequently, behavioural responses to perceived risk could induce nutritional costs.        2. Population declines often coincide with increases in human disturbance, which likely is associated with direct and indirect habitat loss. Nevertheless, behavioural and physiological responses to perceived risks associated with human disturbance could be an added nutritional deficit with population-level repercussions.        3. Using GPS-collar data from three populations of migratory mule deer Odocoileus hemionus exposed to a gradient of established industrial energy development on winter ranges where direct and indirect habitat loss were well documented, we evaluated whether exposure and behavioural responses to human disturbance alter changes in nutritional condition (i.e. fat reserves) over winter.        4. Although animals exhibited behaviours indicative of perceived risk of human disturbance, such as increased movement rates and avoidance of infrastructure, exposure and behavioural responses to human disturbance had little to no measurable effect on fat loss over a winter. Instead, catabolism of fat reserves occurred primarily as a function of the amount of fat animals had entering winter, suggesting that, in the short term, animals were able to mitigate the energetic costs of perceived risk of human disturbance over winter. Animals, however, did not appear to overcome persistent food limitations, and animals with less food availability lost more fat over winter.        5. Our findings heed caution in using short-term behavioural and physiological responses to inform long-term nutritional consequences of human disturbance. Although animals appear to mitigate the energetic costs of perceived risk, food limitations exacerbated by broader-scale avoidance of food near human disturbance may be the primary pathway causing the frequently observed population declines following human disturbance to pristine landscapes.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  1     Total Times Cited:  1     Cited Reference Count:  60 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/1365-2435.13827     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),behaviourally mediated forage loss;energy development;fat reserves;human disturbance;nutritional condition;perceived risk;risk-sensitive foraging;HABITAT SELECTION PATTERNS;HUMAN DISTURBANCE;POPULATION CONSEQUENCES;BEHAVIORAL-RESPONSES;ENERGY DEVELOPMENT;WOODLAND CARIBOU;MULE DEER;RISK;PREDATION;ELK;Humanities;Humanism;Humans,,

Recently, basal metabolic rate (BMR) has been suggested as a potentially important state variable underlying adaptive individual differences in a range of behaviours, including risk-taking. We tested the relationship between BMR and risk-taking in free-living great tits (Parus major) using experimental manipulations of perceived predation risk. We compared the latency of individuals to return to feeders following control (human) and predator (model sparrowhawk, Accipiter nisus) disturbances at fixed feeder locations. We predicted that if variation in risk-taking is shaped by energetic constraints, high BMR individuals should return to feeders sooner following both disturbance types and show smaller changes in risk-taking as a function of predation danger. Higher BMR tended to be associated with lower risk-taking following control disturbances but greater risk-taking following predator disturbances, resulting in a significant interaction between BMR and treatment. Within-individual changes in risk-taking as a function of ambient temperature (a proxy for within-individual changes in energetic constraints) mirrored these results. Lower temperatures tended to be associated with lower risk-taking following control disturbances, but greater risk-taking following predator disturbances, resulting in a significant interaction between temperature and treatment. The effects of BMR and temperature on variation in risk-taking as a function of perceived predation danger were qualitatively similar, suggesting that energetic constraints play a role in shaping risk-taking. However, the hypothesized mechanism (energetic requirements directly influence the optimal expression of risk-taking behaviour) is insufficient to account for the observed negative relationship between energetic constraint and risk-taking following control disturbances. We conclude that variation in risk-taking is associated with differences in energetic constraints, including BMR and temperature, but that the relationship is context-specific, here high vs. low perceived predation risk. Further studies are needed to elucidate potential mechanisms that could generate context-specific relationships between energetic constraints and risk-taking.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  47     Total Times Cited:  47     Cited Reference Count:  51 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/1365-2435.12318     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),animal personality;basal metabolic rate;foraging behaviour;Parus major;PREDATION RISK;SOCIAL-STATUS;PERSONALITY;EVOLUTION;MASS;REPEATABILITY;TEMPERATURE;ENERGETICS;SELECTION;MODELS;Risk-Taking,,

There were striking differences in behaviour among models; high-risk models showed a weaker response to the predator cue and became neophobic in response to the control cue (a novel odour, NO). Observers that were previously paired with low-risk models acquired a strong antipredator response only to the predator cue. However, observers that interacted with high-risk models, displayed a much weaker response to the predator odour and a weak neophobic response to the NO. This is the first study reporting such different outcomes of social learning under different environmental conditions, and suggests high-risk environments promote the cultural transmission of neophobia more so than social learning.

We investigated interactions between coyotes, Canis latrans, and recolonizing wolves at ungulate carcasses in Montana's Madison Range. We used a field-experimental study design consisting of a two-level carcass treatment (wolf presence, wolf absence) to assess factors influencing coyote risk assessment, carrion consumption and aggressive encounters with wolves. Socially dominant coyotes (alphas and betas) responded to wolf presence by increasing the proportion of time spent vigilant while scavenging. Vigilance behaviour was more pronounced when scavenging closer to structurally complex vegetation where lateral occlusion inhibited the ability of coyotes to scan for, and possibly escape from, returning wolves. Despite greater time spent vigilant, alpha coyotes consumed the greatest amount of carrion biomass by feeding on carcasses in earlier stages of consumption when organs and large muscle tissues were still present. This finding suggests that alpha coyotes might trade off greater risk for higher-quality food items. Coyotes would aggressively confront wolves: numerical advantage by coyotes and the stage of carcass consumption were influential in determining whether coyotes were able to displace wolves from carcasses. Coyotes relied on a gradient of risk-sensitive behaviours, ranging from elevated vigilance to aggressive confrontation, to manage risk associated with wolf presence.

We also evaluated if behavioral changes under predation risk were associated with specific morphological phenotypes. We observed that tadpoles chose, although not intensely, habitats with high resource availability when predator cues were absent, but they avoided the same habitats when predation cues were present. We also observed an increase in swimming activity and morphological changes in tadpoles exposed to predation risk, especially related to body and tail morphology, which translates into rapid development. Our results suggest that tadpoles assess habitat quality through resource availability and predation risk.

However, the organization of activity time budgets also needs to be considered, since some activities and the time afforded for performing them may expose animals to higher mortality risks such as increased predation and/or increased metabolic stress. We examined the extent of activity time budgets contribution to explaining variation in life history traits in mammals. We specifically focused on hibernating species because of their marked seasonal cycle of activity/inactivity associated with very different mortality risks. Hibernation is considered a seasonal adaptation to prolonged periods of food shortage and cold. This inactivity period may also reduce both extrinsic and intrinsic mortality risks, by decreasing exposure to predators and drastically reducing metabolic rate. In turn, reduction in mortality may explain why hibernators have slower life history traits than non-hibernators of the same size. Using phylogenetically controlled models, we tested the hypothesis that longevity was positively correlated with the hibernation season duration (the time spent between immergence and emergence from the hibernaculum or den) across 82 different mammalian species. We found that longevity increased significantly with hibernation season duration, an effect that was particularly strong in small hibernators (<1.5 kg) especially for bats. These results confirm that hibernation not only allows mammals to survive periods of energy scarcity, but further suggest that activity time budgets may be selected to reduce mortality risks according to life history pace.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  3     Total Times Cited:  3     Cited Reference Count:  111 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.3389/fphys.2020.00706     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),activity patterns;hibernation;life history;temporal organization of activity;time and energy allocations;trade-off;longevity;mortality risk;MAMMALIAN LIFE-HISTORY;EVAPORATIVE WATER-LOSS;FAST-SLOW CONTINUUM;GROUND-SQUIRRELS;DAILY TORPOR;BODY-SIZE;CALORIE RESTRICTION;CLUSTERING BEHAVIOR;NATURAL-SELECTION;PATTERNS,,

A reduction in individual vigilance against predators when group size increases (the ""group size effect"") is one of the most frequently reported relationships in the study of animal behavior, and is thought to be due to relaxed selection, either because more individuals can detect the predator more easily (the ""many eyes"" effect) or because the risk of predator attack is diluted on more individuals (the ""selfish herd"" effect). I show that these hypotheses are not theoretically grounded: because everybody relies on someone else to raise the alarm, the probability that at least one raises the alarm declines with group size; therefore increasing group size does not lead to relaxed selection. Game theory shows, instead, that increasing the risk that the predator is not reported (by reducing vigilance) induces everybody to give the alarm more often. The group size effect, therefore, can be due to strategic behavior to improve the production of a public good. This shows how a selfish behavior can lead to a benefit for the group, and suggests a way to solve social dilemmas in the absence of relatedness and repeated interactions.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  23     Total Times Cited:  23     Cited Reference Count:  23 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/j.1558-5646.2010.01176.x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Alarm calls;brinkmanship;cooperation;game theory;group size effect;public goods;social dilemma;strategy;vigilance;SIZE;EVOLUTION;BEHAVIOR;GAME,,

Greater levels of fat may provide protection against catastrophic failures in the food supply, but they may also increase the risk of predation. Animals may therefore regulate their fatness according to their perceived risks of predation and starvation: the starvation predation trade-off model. We tested the predictions of this model in wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus) by experimentally manipulating predation risk and starvation risk. We predicted that under increased predation risk individuals would lose weight and under increased starvation risk they would gain it. We simulated increased predation risk by playing the calls made by predatory birds (owls: Tyto alba and Bubo bubo) to the mice. Control groups included exposure to calls of a non-predatory bird (blackbird: Turdus merula) or silence. Mice exposed to owl calls at night lost weight relative to the silence group, mediated via reduced food intake, but exposure to owl calls in the day had no significant effect. Exposure to blackbird calls at night also resulted in weight loss, but blackbird calls in the day had no effect. Mice seemed to have a generalised response to bird calls at night irrespective of their actual source. This could be because in the wild any bird calling at night will be a predation risk, and any bird calling in the day would not be, because at that time the mice would-normally be resting, and hence not exposed to avian predators. Consequently, mice have not evolved to distinguish different types of call but only to respond to the time of day that they occur. Mice exposed to stochastic 24 h starvation events altered their behaviour (reduced activity) during the refeeding days that followed the deprivation periods to regain the lost mass. However, they only marginally elevated their food intake and consequently had reduced body weight/fat storage compared to that of the control unstarved group. This response may have been constrained by physiological factors (alimentary tract absorption capacity) or behavioural factors (perceived risk of predation). Overall the responses of the mice appeared to provide limited support for the starvation predation trade-off model, and suggest that wood mice are much more sensitive to predation risk than they are to starvation risk.

How variation in male traits can persist under these conditions remains problematic (the lek paradox). Here, we present several game-theoretic models that show that avoidance of costly and mobile predators, sneakers, or brood parasites (enemies) leads to variation in female choice. This can result in maintenance of variation in male quality. ""Enemies"" will congregate around higher quality males. Females must then trade-off the benefits of mating with high-quality males against the increased risk of enemies. At equilibrium, the models predict a positive correlation between the quality of a male and the proportions of both enemies and females visiting him. In the first model, we use this framework to predict the lowest quality male on the lek that will receive any matings. In the second model, we examine the influence of this female-enemy game on the maintenance of variation in male quality. Low-quality males are likely to persist when enemies are costly to females or occur at high density, and when there is some spatial structure on the lek, so that neighboring males are typically of similar quality. If enemies are more costly to males than to females, high-quality males may benefit from receiving fewer female visits. In the third model, we consider the special case when enemies are male reproductive parasites. These models illustrate the importance of considering the simultaneous decisions of multiple players in mate choice games.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  10     Total Times Cited:  10     Cited Reference Count:  70 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1093/beheco/ari099     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),alternative reproductive tactics;genetic variation;harassment;predation risk;sexual selection;MALE MATE CHOICE;SEXUAL-HARASSMENT;MEDITERRANEAN WRASSE;FEMALE PREFERENCES;MATING PREFERENCES;BREEDING-BEHAVIOR;PARENTAL CARE;GOOD GENES;EVOLUTION;PARADOX;Prednisolone,,

Signaling in this context could either dishonestly indicate predator detection, or honestly indicate vigilance, but no study has tested these hypotheses experimentally. We tested the vigilance advertisement function of tail flagging, a signal given by California ground squirrels (Otospermophilus beecheyi) to rattlesnakes (Crotalus oreganus), by simulating snake strikes and quantifying strike avoidance behaviors in signaling and non-signaling squirrels. We removed the effect of snake presence on signaling by simulating strikes 1) in the presence of a rattlesnake, 2) with no snake present, or 3) in an area where squirrels had recently encountered a snake that was no longer present. Squirrels tail flagged most when interacting with a snake. Squirrels also signaled in areas of recent snake encounters, and in this context, they responded faster to simulated strikes and were more likely to leap vertically or horizontally away from the attack. Tail flagging rate was also related to squirrels' body displacement time and flee modality. Squirrels rarely signaled or exhibited evasive leaping with no snake present. These results indicate that displays in the absence of predators can honestly signal vigilance, or the readiness to avoid an attack, even if predators are undetected. Such antipredator displays may be widespread as many species could benefit from advertising alertness when uncertain of the location of predators.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  26     Total Times Cited:  27     Cited Reference Count:  63 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1093/beheco/aru176     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),animal communication;Crotalus oreganus;honesty;Otospermophilus beecheyi;predator-prey interactions;pursuit-deterrent signal;PURSUIT DETERRENT FUNCTION;ANTIPREDATOR VIGILANCE;INDIVIDUAL VARIATION;RATTLESNAKES;CALIFORNIA;BEHAVIOR;STRIKE;PREY;INFORMATION;ANIMALS;Prednisolone,,

Some prey species can shift their daily activity patterns to reduce the risk of encountering predators, and, in turn, predators develop strategies to increase their chances of meeting prey. European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) is a key species in Iberian Mediterranean ecosystems. It is the main prey for many vertebrate predators. It is also a game species and is often the target of management measures such as translocations.        Aims. To test whether rabbits adjust their activity patterns in response to differing predation regimes in a management context.        Methods. Rabbits were translocated from a donor area, with a high rabbit density, to a release area in central Spain, with a semi-permeable fenced plot and an unfenced plot, which had no rabbits before the translocation. We estimated daily activity patterns and relative abundance index (RAI) for mesocarnivores and rabbits by using camera-traps, and calculated Jacobs selection index (JSI) to classify each species in a diel period. Additionally, we calculated the activity overlap between prey and mesocarnivores in the different areas.        Key results. Rabbits were nocturnal in the donor area, where only two mesocarnivore species were detected, red fox (Vulpes vulpes, with a high RAI) and Egyptian mongoose (Herpestes ichneumon, with a low RAI). However, in the unfenced area, where five mesocarnivore species were present, rabbits showed a crepuscular trend with two activity peaks, around sunrise and around sunset. In contrast, rabbits showed a nocturnal activity in the fenced plot, where four mesocarnivore species were detected but where only the Egyptian mongoose (strictly diurnal) had a high RAI value.        Conclusions and implications. The results suggest that rabbits in the fenced plot adapted their activity to avoid the diurnal mongooses. Conversely, rabbits in unfenced areas showed a trend towards day/twilight activity patterns as an adaptation to a diverse community of mesocarnivores. Rabbits can adapt their daily activity patterns to reduce predation risk depending on the pressure exerted by different predator species, with conservation and management implications. These adaptations would allow higher success of rabbit translocations despite the risk of predation by carnivores and could help in the management design of future translocations of this key species.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  3     Total Times Cited:  3     Cited Reference Count:  68 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1071/WR20156     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),European rabbits;predator-prey relationship;red fox;Egyptian mongoose;adaptive behaviour;Prednisolone,,

However, anti-predatory strategies studied in spider mites generally considers mainly the female perspective (e.g. oviposition), leaving a gap in how T. urticae couples deal with predatory risk. Here, through laboratory experiments, we observed that matured spider mite couples were only affected by predation risk during the pre-copulatory stages of the mating process, especially when deciding to proceed in a mating opportunity. The mating performance of individuals was independent of their exposure to predation risk, suggesting that couples would adopt full investment behavior after opting to proceed in a mating attempt.

For some species, these changes have been shown to arise primarily through changes in foraging activity. Theoretically, changes in age and size at maturity can arise through either behavioural or physiological responses. Here we analyse two models. The first is a conventional life-history model with no explicit recognition of the physiology of energy utilization by the organism - growth (i.e. weight gain) is simply the difference between assimilation and respiration, and there are no physiological restrictions on the timing of maturation. The changes in age and size at maturity in response to food availability and predation risk predicted by this model are consistent with published experimental data for one particular species, the midge Chironomus tentans. Numerical calculations with parameters appropriate to this species suggest that the optimal response is purely behavioural. The second model is a general, dynamic energy budget model that takes account of the energetic costs associated with development to reproductive maturity. With that model, we prove that the optimum partitioning of energy between growth and development is independent of predation risk and food availability, thereby demonstrating the generality of the previous finding with the life-history model. On the basis of the combined insight from the two models, we propose that fixed allocation to growth and development. despite variation in food availability and predation risk, is optimal for a broad class of life histories. Consequently, the absence of an allocation response to experimental manipulation of food or predators should not necessarily be taken as evidence for physiological or other constraints on life-history adaptation.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  20     Total Times Cited:  21     Cited Reference Count:  33 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",,age at maturity;Chironomidae;foraging activity;growth curve;life history;optimization;resource allocation;size at maturity;CHIRONOMUS-PLUMOSUS;TRADE-OFF;GROWTH;SIZE;AGE;FITNESS;CONSEQUENCES;REPRODUCTION;EVOLUTION;EQUATION;Prednisolone,,

On the one hand, recent theoretical models predict increased use of scrounging with increasing predation risk, when scroungers seeking feeding opportunities also have a higher chance of detecting predators. On the other hand, there may be no relation between tactic use and predation when antipredator vigilance is not compatible with scanning flockmates. We investigated experimentally the effects of predation risk on social foraging tactic use in tree sparrows, Passer montanus. We manipulated predation risk in the field by changing the distance between shelter and a feeder. Birds visited the feeder in smaller flocks, spent less time on it and were somewhat more vigilant far from shelter than close to it. Increased predation risk strongly affected the social foraging tactic used: birds used the scrounger tactic 30% more often far from cover than close to it. Between-flock variability in scrounging frequency was not related to the average vigilance level of the flock members, and within-flock variability in the use of scrounging was negatively related to the vigilance of birds. Our results suggest that in tree sparrows, the increased frequency of scrounging during high predation risk cannot simply be explained by an additional advantage of increasing antipredator vigilance. We propose alternative mechanisms (e.g. increased stochasticity in food supply, and that riskier places are used by individuals with lower reserves) that may explain increased scrounging when animals forage under high predation risk.

The first euthanised wild dog was the last surviving of a break-away pack of 6, and the second was the last of a larger pack of 18, the rest of which died with no carcasses being found or carcasses too decomposed for sampling. Subsequent antigenic typing of the lyssaviruses indicated that they were canid RABVs. The RABVs originating from 22 wild carnivore species, 7 dogs, and a caprine, mostly from the North West province, were genetically characterised by targeting a partial region of the nucleoprotein gene. The nucleotide sequence analyses of these viruses and two previously characterised RABVs confirmed that the outbreak viruses were also canid rabies, phylogenetically clustering with virus isolates originating from black-backed jackals recovered between 2012 and 2015 from the North West province, and domestic dogs from neighbouring communal areas. The source(s) of the mortalities and possible reservoir host(s) for the virus could only be speculated upon from data on specific predator numbers, movements and behaviour, kills, park management and the changing environmental ecology, which were monitored closely in Madikwe over several years. The most likely rabies sources were from boundary fence contacts between wild carnivores within the park, with domestic dogs or cats and/or naturally occurring wild carnivores outside the park. The associated risk of zoonotic infection and threat to important and endangered predators may be mitigated through regional rabies control primarily in domestic dogs and cats, as well as by preventative vaccination of at-risk park employees and their pets. The importance of ongoing prophylactic rabies protection by regular vaccination of highly endangered wildlife carnivores and the submission of carcasses for rabies diagnosis of any wild or domestic animals behaving uncharacteristically or found dead is emphasised.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  5     Total Times Cited:  5     Cited Reference Count:  64 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.4102/jsava.v89i0.1517     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),MOLECULAR EPIDEMIOLOGY;DISTEMPER VIRUS;NATIONAL-PARK;ZIMBABWE;EXPOSURE;VACCINE;TRANSMISSION;INACTIVATION;MORTALITY;INFECTION;Dogs;South Africa,,

Theoretically, prey should distinguish odors of predators and nonpredators. The manifestation of defensive antipredator behaviors has been extensively researched in domestic species (i.e., the relationship between laboratory-bred rats and domestic cats). However, little is known about the expression of these behaviors in wild rodents. Studies have so far focused on quantitative assessments of cost-benefit trade-offs or giving-up densities. We examined the expression of fine-scale defensive behaviors in Arnhem rock rats (Zyzomys maini) in response to fecal cues from 2 predators (the northern quoll [Dasyurus hallucatus] and the dingo [Canis dingo]), a nonpredator (the short-eared rock-wallaby [Petrogale brachyotis]), and a control (water). We adapted a predator-odor avoidance apparatus that has been widely used for domestic rodent studies to film the behavior of wild rock rats in a captive environment. Rock rats did not alter their behavior in the presence of odors of nonpredators, predators, or controls. In the current study, individual rock rats behaved in a consistent manner across time, and we identified 3 individually consistent behaviors which may suggest the existence of personality traits in this species. We suggest that these individual differences may influence wild rock rat behavior more than predation risk. These differences should therefore be taken into consideration when investigating behavioral responses to predators in wild populations.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  9     Total Times Cited:  9     Cited Reference Count:  45 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1093/jmammal/gyv142     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Arnhem rock rat;behavior;Canis dingo;Dasyurus hallucatus;personality;Petrogale brachyotis;predation;rodent;temperament;Zyzomys maini;EVOLUTIONARY GENETICS;CAT ODOR;PREY;PERSONALITY;TEMPERAMENT;HABITUATION;RESPONSES;ECOLOGY;MAMMALS;FIELD;Prednisolone;Rodentia,,

Juveniles constitute a particularly vulnerable life stage, with growing evidence that within stages, individual strategies may be associated with greater predation risk and mortality. These forms of predator-prey dynamics are rarely explored in marine environments due to difficulties in confirming vital status of individuals, and the lack of data sets that link mortality to behavior. We analyzed 2 concurrently collected data sets for juvenile Steller sea lions Eumetopias jubatus in the Gulf of Alaska to examine associations between mortality and specific behavioral patterns. Forty-five juvenile Steller sea lions were instrumented with external satellite tags and internally implanted vital rate transmitters (LHX tags). From 2005 through 2018, 25 juveniles remained alive and 20 died (18 confirmed predation). Using a binomial generalized linear mixedeffects model, we tested whether the probability of individual mortality was associated with seasonally specific dive patterns (time wet, dive depth) or horizontal movement patterns (home range size, average trip distance). Additionally, in 3 cases, external tags were transmitting until death. To examine links between fine-scale ante-mortem behavioral patterns and predation susceptibility, we compared dive patterns recorded during the last 3 d of data transmissions (both for animals which survived and for those which died) to dive patterns recorded during other periods at sea. Results suggest individuals that spent more time dry or dove shallower had a greater mortality probability, which could reflect foraging tactics of predators. This study highlights the effectiveness of combining multiple telemetry systems for exploring the vulnerability of individuals to the consumptive effects of predators.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  2     Total Times Cited:  2     Cited Reference Count:  57 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.3354/esr00999     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Predation;Bio-logging;Diving behavior;Eumetopias jubatus;Risk;Marine mammal;PACIFIC SLEEPER SHARK;ANTIPREDATOR BEHAVIOR;EUMETOPIAS-JUBATUS;NORTHEAST PACIFIC;DIVE BEHAVIOR;NATIONAL-PARK;HABITAT USE;LANDSCAPE;FEAR;RISK;Diving;Prednisolone,,

In essence, the models predict that increasing economic defendability of a resource should lead to increased frequency of aggression among competitors. We question this prediction because it is based on the assumption that individuals that do not possess a resource and must decide whether to attempt aggressive appropriation of another individual's resource face the same economic decision as those that already have possession of a resource and must decide whether to defend against an appropriator's attack. Using an evolutionary game analysis, we explore how changes in group size, clump density, patch richness, and predation hazards affect both the decision to appropriate and defend a resource and interact to predict effects on the frequency of aggression and aggressiveness of individuals. Our model predicts that increasing group size should result in a dome-shaped response of frequency of aggression and a slight decrease in aggressiveness. Increasing clump density is predicted to increase both the frequency of aggression and aggressiveness while increases in clump richness result in reduced aggressiveness at high richness values and a decelerated increase in the frequency of aggression. Finally, predation risk is predicted to increase the frequency of aggression only slightly but to lead to increases in aggressiveness. We compare these predictions to earlier resource defense models. We conclude that most experimental findings agree with our model's predictions but call for explicit experimental tests of our predictions concerning the frequency of aggression and aggressiveness.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  37     Total Times Cited:  38     Cited Reference Count:  36 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1890/04-0566     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),aggression;ESS model;foraging groups;hawk-dove game;kleptoparasilism;producer-scrounger game;NUTMEG MANNIKINS;SCROUNGER USE;FOOD;BEHAVIOR;MONOPOLIZATION;PRODUCERS;PREDICTABILITY;AGGRESSION;INTENSITY;INCREASES;Health Resources,,

However, the benefits and costs of being part of a mixed-species group do not need to be evenly distributed between the species in a group. In this paper, we modeled the evolutionary stable strategy (ESS) for the optimal level of vigilance of an individual in a mixed-species group influenced by the effects of ""many eyes,"" ""dilution"" and ""attraction,"" and unequal costs and benefits between the species. Our model illustrates under what conditions associations with other species may facilitate reduced predation risk for at least one of the participating species.

Furthermore, as group size increases, the individual's risk of predation may decline through dilution with more potential victims, but may increase if larger groups attract more predators. These are known, respectively, as the dilution effect and the attraction effect.        Assumptions: Feeding animals use vigilance to trade-off food and safety. Net feeding rate declines linearly with vigilance. Question: How do the many-eyes, dilution, and attraction effects interact to influence the relationship between group size and vigilance behaviour?        Mathematical methods: We use game theory and the fitness-generating function to determine the ESS level of vigilance of an individual within a group.        Predictions: Vigilance decreases with group size as a consequence of the many-eyes and dilution effects but increases with group size as a consequence of the attraction effect, when they act independent of each other. Their synergetic effects on vigilance depend upon the relative strengths of each and their interactions.

We compared our results with those from other studies conducted across the impala species range. Impala lambing was highly synchronized in Chobe with 90% of lambs born within 2 weeks in mid-November. Variation in rainfall in the preceding wet season explained 74% of variation in the dates of the first lamb observation in Mala Mala. In Chobe, the earliest birth peak occurred after the highest rainfall and the body condition of lambs in that cohort was also best for both males and females. No association was found between the lunar cycle and the estimated onset of the conception period, despite previous studies having found an association between the lunar cycle and the rutting behaviour in males. On a regional scale, impalas in areas with a marked dry season (several months with no rain) tend to synchronize births with the onset of the rains, when grass quality is highest. Number of months with rain explained 78% of the regional variation in birth synchrony. Neither latitude nor total rainfall contributed significantly to a stepwise multiple regression model.

Alternatively they may reduce environmental uncertainty by exploration, while risking no energy rewards and exposure to hazards, and use the information retrieved for subsequent decision making. When exploring, however, animals may adopt different tactics according to individual states.        Results: We tested that energy states will affect exploratory behavior by experimenting with wild-caught untrained Eurasian tree sparrows (Passer montanus) in fasted or fed states exploring in a novel space with hidden food supply in different patch distribution patterns. Our data revealed that fasted sparrows risked being earlier explorers more often, initiated more exploratory bouts before patches were found, and stayed longer on the ground under both patch patterns. Fasted sparrows discovered more patches and consumed more food than fed sparrows in dispersed, but not necessary so in clumped, patch patterns; whereas fed birds also increased patch finding to a certain level in dispersed patterns. Sparrows of both energy states, however, did not differ in feeding rates in either patch pattern.        Conclusions: Exploratory behavior of tree sparrows is state-dependent, which supports our prediction that birds with an energy shortage will be risk-prone and explore more readily. Our study also indicates a game nature of tree sparrow exploratory behavior in a group context when explorers are in different energy states and are exposed to different patch distributions. Birds of lower energy state adopting an active exploring tactic may be favored by obtaining higher energy gains in dispersed patch patterns with lower patch richness. More satiated birds, however, achieved a similar feeding rate by lowered exposure time.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  5     Total Times Cited:  5     Cited Reference Count:  73 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1186/s12983-016-0180-y     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Energy state;Exploration;Predation risk;Producer-scrounger;Sparrows;SOCIAL-FORAGING STRATEGIES;INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES;ANIMAL PERSONALITY;PREDATION HAZARD;INFORMATION;PRODUCER;RISK;ECOLOGY;WILD;EXPLOITATION,,

We consider variation in the risks incurred to individuals and in how the activities of the two animals interact to influence the probability of success. We also consider that the animals may be relatives and thus share evolutionary interests. The model is general and can, for instance, be applied to mammalian predators attempting to capture and subdue large and dangerous prey or to female parasitoid wasps that attack and, if successful, paralyse aggressive hosts that then provide the only feeding resource for their offspring. This minimal model of cooperation contains three dimensionless parameters: vulnerability (the ratio between the average time for a lone attacker to subdue the defending resource and the average time for the defender to fatally strike the attacker), the dilution ratio (the extent to which attack by animals acting in tandem reduces a defender's ability to kill its attackers) and the relatedness between the potential attackers. The model predicts that higher values of all three parameters favour cooperation and that for small values cooperation is not evolutionarily stable. Cooperation can arise from an ancestral state of non-cooperation if values of all parameters are sufficiently high but cannot arise among non-relatives, irrespective of other parameter values. Once cooperation has emerged in a population, it can be maintained among nonrelatives at modest values of dilution ratio and vulnerability. We discuss these general predictions in particular relation to the parasitoid genus Sclerodermus, in which multiple females may attack unusually large and aggressive hosts and in which host attack behaviour is mediated by kinship.

Habitat, especially vegetation structure, can influence all of these factors concurrently. Binary categorical assessments of habitat as open or closed, however, confound at least two functions of habitat structure that could influence the perceived risk of predation: concealment, which functions to hide an individual, and visibility, which enhances detection of a potential predator. Both can influence predation risk independently and simultaneously. In this study, we decoupled these functional properties of vegetation and studied the effects of concealment, visibility, and proximity to a refuge on the distance at which pygmy rabbits (Brachylagus idahoensis) fled from an approaching threat (flight initiation distance; FID). Concealment by vegetation decreased perceptions of risk; however, pygmy rabbits exhibited elevated risk at high levels of visibility, regardless of the amount of concealment. Proximity to burrow entrances also influenced perceptions of risk, such that risk was significantly lower when rabbits were on or near burrow systems. Disentangling the functional properties of habitat can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the factors that influence perceived risk and escape behaviors of prey and provide insight into how habitat structure mechanistically relates to predation risk.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  63     Total Times Cited:  65     Cited Reference Count:  53 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/eth.12000     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),FLIGHT INITIATION DISTANCE;RABBITS BRACHYLAGUS-IDAHOENSIS;PREDATION RISK;ESCAPE DECISIONS;HABITAT SELECTION;TIME ALLOCATION;BEHAVIOR;VIGILANCE;CRYPSIS;COVER,,

Vigilance increases fitness by improving predator detection but at the expense of increasing starvation risk. We related variation in vigilance among 122 radio-tagged overwintering grey partridges Perdix perdix (L.) across 20 independent farmland sites in England to predation risk (sparrowhawk Accipiter nisus L., kill rate), use of alternative antipredation behaviours (grouping and use of cover) and survival.        2. Vigilance was significantly higher when individuals fed in smaller groups and in taller vegetation. In the covey period (in early winter when partridges are in flocks), vigilance and use of taller vegetation was significantly higher at sites with higher sparrowhawk predation risk, but tall vegetation was used less by larger groups. Individuals were constrained in reducing individual vigilance by group size and habitat choice because maximum group size was determined by overall density in the area during the covey period and by the formation of pairs at the end of the winter (pair period), when there was also a significant twofold increase in the use of tall cover.        3. Over the whole winter individual survival was higher in larger groups and was lower in the pair period. However, when controlling for group size, mean survival decreased as vigilance increased in the covey period. This result, along with vigilance being higher at sites with increasing with raptor risk, suggests individual vigilance increases arose to reduce short-term predation risk from raptors but led to long-term fitness decreases probably because high individual vigilance increased starvation risk or indicated longer exposure to predation. The effect of raptors on survival was less when there were large groups in open habitats, where individual partridges can probably both detect predators and feed efficiently.        4. Our study suggests that increasing partridge density and modifying habitat to remove the need for high individual vigilance may decrease partridge mortality. It demonstrates the general principle that antipredation behaviours may reduce fitness long-term via their effects on the starvation-predation risk trade-off, even though they decrease predation risk short-term, and that it may be ecological constraints, such as poor habitat (that lead to an antipredation behaviour compromising foraging), that cause mortality, rather than the proximate effect of an antipredation behaviour such as vigilance.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  73     Total Times Cited:  77     Cited Reference Count:  47 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/j.1365-2656.2006.01194.x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),compensation;grey partridge;predation risk;vigilance;HUNTING BEHAVIOR;FEEDING LOCATION;TRINGA-TOTANUS;RISK;CONSERVATION;REDSHANKS;HABITAT;PREY;CONSEQUENCES;PASSERINES;Prednisolone,,

In seasonal ice environments, there is evidence that polar bear predation of Arctic bird eggs is increasing because of earlier sea ice breakup, which forces polar bears into nearshore terrestrial environments where Arctic birds are nesting. Because polar bears can consume a large number of nests before becoming satiated, and because they can swim between island colonies, they could have dramatic influences on seabird and sea duck reproductive success. However, it is unclear whether nest foraging can provide an energetic benefit to polar bear populations, especially given the capacity of bird populations to redistribute in response to increasing predation pressure. In this study, we develop a spatially explicit agent-based model of the predator-prey relationship between polar bears and common eiders, a common and culturally important bird species for northern peoples. Our model is composed of two types of agents (polar bear agents and common eider hen agents) whose movements and decision heuristics are based on species-specific bioenergetic and behavioral ecological principles, and are influenced by historical and extrapolated sea ice conditions. Our model reproduces empirical findings that polar bear predation of bird nests is increasing and predicts an accelerating relationship between advancing ice breakup dates and the number of nests depredated. Despite increases in nest predation, our model predicts that polar bear body condition during the ice-free period will continue to decline. Finally, our model predicts that common eider nests will become more dispersed and will move closer to the mainland in response to increasing predation, possibly increasing their exposure to land-based predators and influencing the livelihood of local people that collect eider eggs and down. These results show that predatorprey interactions can have nonlinear responses to changes in climate and provides important predictions of ecological change in Arctic ecosystems.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  21     Total Times Cited:  22     Cited Reference Count:  72 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/gcb.13499     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),agent-based model;Arctic;biological interaction;climate change;ecological forecast;foraging;individual based-model;MARITIMUS SUMMER DIETS;CLIMATE-CHANGE;URSUS-MARITIMUS;ENERGETIC CONTRIBUTION;REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS;IMPACTS;MODELS;RISK;BEHAVIOR;PERIOD;Prednisolone,,

Instead, individuals at the tail of an escaping group suffer the bulk of the group's predation risk, and thus have the highest incentive to desert it. Just because of this, desertion, in this case, may serve as a signal of vulnerability for the pursuing predator. Under wide conditions, it is therefore shown that the predator is always expected to prefer the chasing of a deserter, whenever it is observed. Consequently, an individual who finds himself at the tail of the herd must compare the risk of remaining there with that of deserting the herd and thereby becoming a likely target for predation. If the first risk is higher than the latter, the herd disperses; if the latter is higher, the herd cohesively follows the fastest individuals in its lead (we deal also with cases in which only part of the herd disperses). We see, however, that the question which risk is higher depends not only on the terrain, but also on the route of escape that is decided by the fastest members at the lead of the herd, those that are least likely to be caught. Concentrating on herds without family structure, we assume that the route of escape is selfishly chosen by these ad hoc leaders to minimize their own predation risk, regardless of the others' welfare. However, the predation risk of the leader depends very much on the willingness of other herd members to follow him, thus providing a buffer between him and the pursuing predator. Consequently, when choosing an escape route, the leader has also to consider the cohesion of the herd, i.e., the reaction of slower individuals to his choice. Under some plausible conditions, this choice may force the herd to follow, while other conditions may lead to its dispersal. In some cases the leader may choose a route that serves the needs of the entire group, and sometime only those of its more vulnerable members. In other cases the leader may choose a route that sacrifices the weakest members, thereby improving the survival probability of the others.        We employ a model of a k + 1 players game, a single predator, and k heterogeneous prey individuals. The predator aims to maximize the probability of a successful catch, and each individual aims to minimize his probability of being caught. (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Although part of Africa's large carnivores' diet, predation on baboons is usually avoided. We investigated prey selection patterns of African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus) in Mana Pools National Park, Zimbabwe. Based on direct and indirect observations and analyses of faecal samples, we show that baboons form a substantial part of the African wild dog diet and were more frequently predated on than would be expected based on availability.

The flocks were photographed every 10-20 min, and the shape and location of the flock was determined from a plan view obtained from digitized images of the photographs. Flocks initially maintained a tight formation shortly after arrival, but then tended to expand with increasing residence time. The rate of expansion, however, was significantly greater in large flocks, with small flocks showing no consistent pattern. Observed rates of change in flock area were compared with those obtained from a simple model of flock movement in which individuals followed a random walk and moved at a constant speed. In contrast to the observed data, small simulated flocks (with relatively more edge birds) showed the greatest relative increase in flock area. This discrepancy between the data and the simulation can be explained mechanistically by differences in the behaviour of individuals in flocks of different sizes. In large flocks, birds at the leading edge of the flock had faster step rates and travelled further than birds in the centre and at the trailing edge. Rates of movement in small flocks did not vary with flock position. Levels of vigilance were higher during the first 10 min after arrival, in males, in smaller flocks and at the edges of flocks. Thus, upon arrival, flocks maintain a tight defensive formation with high vigilance, but with increasing residence time, vigilance decreases and larger flocks expand, suggesting a need for individuals to reduce feeding competition.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  31     Total Times Cited:  33     Cited Reference Count:  31 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1017/S0952836902003278     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),barnacle goose;Branta leucopsis;flocking;foraging behaviour;vigilance;predation risk;GROUP-SIZE;GOOSE FLOCKS;SELFISH HERD;BRENT GEESE;VIGILANCE;COVER;INCREASES;BEHAVIOR;DISTANCE;MINNOW;Prednisolone,,

We evaluated the fitness consequences for males adopting one of four alternative strategies: calling, satelliting, foraging, or hiding. Various factors potentially influence male behavior, including energy reserves, predation risk, cost of calling, probability of finding food, distribution of male energy states in the population, and probability of surviving to another breeding season. We manipulated these parameters to determine how strongly each affects breeding phenology and chorus structure. Manipulating parameters related to the energetic costs and benefits of individual decisions, we generated the three basic patterns of anuran breeding phenology: explosive, continuous, and prolonged breeding with episodic chorusing. Increasing the probability of successful foraging caused a shift from an explosive pattern to a prolonged, episodic chorusing pattern. Decreasing the calling cost resulted in continuous chorusing. Our model predicted that satelliting will be a rare strategy adopted by individuals with relatively low energy reserves. Additionally, individuals adopting the satellite strategy should alternate among satelliting, foraging, and calling as their energy reserves fluctuate. Our results suggest that energetic costs of reproduction and resource limitation may be crucial factors influencing the phenology of anuran chorusing. We propose that under varying conditions of resource availability, male decisions are the consequence of two strategies: a starvation minimization strategy and an energy-state maximization strategy.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  42     Total Times Cited:  45     Cited Reference Count:  47 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1093/beheco/11.4.429     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),alternative mating strategies;anuran bleeding;breeding phenology;chorusing;dynamic optimization modeling;leks;ALTERNATIVE MATING TACTICS;NEOTROPICAL HYLID FROGS;GREAT PLAINS TOAD;SEXUAL SELECTION;CALLING BEHAVIOR;REPRODUCTIVE ENERGETICS;HYPEROLIUS-MARMORATUS;CHORUS ORGANIZATION;LIFE-HISTORY;REED FROGS;Breeding,,

Density-dependence contributes to regulating the dynamics of partially migratory populations by altering habitat selection, vital rates, or rates of behavioral switching between migratory tactics. Studies of mechanisms leading to these shifts have focused mainly on their behavior on summer range, overlooking the potential for density-dependent effects during winter that may influence decisions to migrate. We hypothesized that competition for food and safety from wolf predation risk on winter ranges would differentially affect habitat selection, movements, and grouping behavior of migrant and resident female North American elk (Cervus canadensis) on their sympatric winter range. We used GPS locations from 92 adult female elk in 155 elk-winters at Ya Ha Tinda, Alberta, Canada, over a 14-year period when the elk population declined by similar to 70% to test our hypotheses. Elk showed consistently strong selection for areas of high forage biomass that corresponded to longer residence times and shorter return times to areas of high forage biomass. The strength of the selection diminished at high elk population size as did the extent to which elk traded off forage for safety from wolf predation risk. Elk increased movement rates and extended return times only to the riskiest areas. Median group size and mean sociality among elk increased at low population size, with resident elk groups being larger and more cohesive than migrant groups. Similar density-dependent responses by migrant and resident female elk on sympatric winter range indicate resident elk do not alter foraging behaviors to compensate for exposure to low nutritional resources in summer, implicating seasonal differences in nutrition are not mediated by winter densities in this system. We discuss the implications of competition on winter ranges for the maintenance of partial migration in ungulates in montane systems.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  7     Total Times Cited:  7     Cited Reference Count:  132 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.3389/fevo.2020.00269     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Cervus canadensis;density-dependent habitat selection;foraging movements;partial migration;predation risk;WHITE-TAILED DEER;COLLECTIVE DECISION-MAKING;HABITAT-SELECTION;PREDATION RISK;GROUP-SIZE;RESOURCE SELECTION;TRADE-OFFS;ANIMAL MOVEMENT;UNDERSTANDING VARIATION;ANTIPREDATOR RESPONSE,,

From our analyses we then derive the optimization of dynamic utility, in which the utility of weight gain, given the current body size, is a logarithmic function: hence the fitness function of an individual varies depending on its current body size. The dynamic utility function also shows that animals are universally sensitive to risk and display risk-averse behaviors.

This article presents a simple optimal foraging model under predation risks and verified the effect of behavioral optimization on the foraging time ratio. In this model, foragers are exposed to predation risks during foraging but are safe if they stay in their nests without any food. The foraging time allocation strategies that optimize the geometric mean fitness (Level 2) were compared with the arithmetic mean fitness (Level 1) to verify the effects of intergenerational stochasticity, whereby there is an alternation in good/bad environments across generations. As in previous studies, risk-averse strategies (a shorter foraging time is adopted for Level 2 than for Level 1) were commonly observed using this model. Unexpectedly, the model showed a tendency toward a preference for risk-prone strategies. This qualitative difference became prominent when food was abundant and the maximum energy reserves were small. Theoretical studies have shown that risk-averse strategies are commonly adopted during food shortages and result in starvation. However, the current results indicate that risk-prone strategies may become optimal under a limited reserve capacity. Thus, the optimal strategy depends not only on the individual status and environmental conditions, but also on the detailed selection regimes.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  2     Total Times Cited:  2     Cited Reference Count:  63 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/1440-1703.1058     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),adaptive behavior;foraging theory;geometric mean fitness;mathematical modeling;optimal behavior;DYNAMIC DECISION-MAKING;PREDATION-RISK;TRADE-OFF;FOOD AVAILABILITY;LIFE;REPRODUCTION;TIME;UNCERTAINTY;ALLOCATION;EFFICIENCY,,

This can produce a trait-mediated indirect interaction (TMII) between predators and prey resources, whereby reduced foraging by prey in the presence of a predator causes an increase in prey resources. TMIIs play important roles in structuring communities, and it is important to understand factors that determine their strength. One such influence may be behavioural variation in the prey species, with indirect effects of predators being stronger within populations that are more responsive to the presence of a predator. We tested 1) whether the behavioural responsiveness of populations of wood frog tadpoles to predator cues was related to the predation risk in their native ponds, and 2) whether more responsive tadpoles yielded stronger TMIIs. To do this, we 1) measured the activity of tadpoles from 18 populations in mesocosms with and without caged predators, and 2) measured changes in the biomass of periphyton (the tadpoles' diet) between predator treatments for each population. We found that tadpoles from higher predation risk ponds reduced their time outside refuges more in the presence of predators and tended to move less when visible, suggesting possible local adaptation to predation regimes. Though the presence of predators generally resulted in higher periphyton biomass - a TMII - there was no evidence that the strength of this TMII was affected by variation in tadpole behaviour. Foraging activity and general activity may be decoupled to some extent, enabling high predation risk-adapted tadpoles to limit the fitness costs of reduced foraging when predators are present.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  12     Total Times Cited:  12     Cited Reference Count:  51 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/oik.01488     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),TRADE-OFF;ECOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES;PHENOTYPIC DIVERGENCE;TROPHIC CASCADES;AMPHIBIAN LARVAE;PLASTICITY;FISH;INHIBITION;MECHANISMS;EVOLUTION;Prednisolone,,

African savannas with extensive versus minimal woody cover often have vastly different animal communities. However, we lack a clear mechanistic understanding of why animal communities are changing with vegetation structure. Our goal for this study was to understand how vegetation structure in an African savanna shaped the perceived predation risk of small mammals, hence affecting their activity. Using a reciprocal measure of standard giving-up-densities, amount of food eaten, we found sharp declines in rodents' perceived predation risk and increased rodent activity underneath shrub cover. This response was consistent across species; however, species showed subtle differences in their responses to grassy vegetation. Our findings suggest that areas of minimal or extensive shrub cover (shrub encroachment) may be homogenizing rodents' perceptions of predation risk and thus shaping their use of space.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  12     Total Times Cited:  13     Cited Reference Count:  82 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1038/s41598-019-53071-y     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),PATCH USE;COMMUNITY STRUCTURE;AFRICAN SAVANNA;LAND-USE;HABITAT SELECTION;FORAGING BEHAVIOR;MUS-MINUTOIDES;CLIMATE-CHANGE;ENCROACHMENT;DIVERSITY;Prednisolone,,

For instance, embryonic sensitivity to environmental conditions and maternal constraints vary dramatically across pregnancy, and these dynamics should modulate the cost-benefit balance of refuge use. We experimentally studied thermoregulation and refuge use in pregnant and nonreproductive aspic vipers, Vipera aspis, at different stages of gestation (first, middle and last third). We determined preferred body temperatures (T-set) in a cost-free environment to test for fecundity and stage dependencies of maternal T-set. Then, we examined behavioural responses to repeated simulated predatory attacks. Pregnant females were extremely precise thermoregulators compared with nonreproductive females, and T-set was independent of litter size or gestation stage. After simulated attacks, pregnant females limited their time spent in the refuge and thereby their deviation from T-set. By contrast, nonreproductive females had a greater response to predation exposure and adjusted their response to risk level. Contrary to our predictions, pregnant females did not vary their behaviour based on gestation stage, despite increasing physical burden as pregnancy progressed. Overall, our results illustrate that pregnant females alter their behaviour to benefit their developing embryos thermally despite risk to themselves (increased exposure). By doing so, however, the female realizes a benefit by accelerating temperature-sensitive developmental time and thus reducing the duration of pregnancy and associated physical burden.

Less is known about how predation risk can affect individual spatial positioning and group fidelity. We tracked individuals within groups goldfish (Carassius auratus) as they left a safe, covered, microhabitat to enter a risky, open-water, microhabitat over 2 days: one with and one without an avian predator (little egret-Egretta garzetta) present. For each day, an outing index was calculated to take into account both individual order of emergence from the refuge and the proportion of outings participated in. Prior to the experiment, fish were individually marked for identification, measured, and tested for boldness to enter a novel area. Body size did not predict individual outing index scores on either control or experimental days. Boldness index scores influenced outing index scores only on days with an egret present. We found individual outing index scores to be relatively consistent across both days. regardless of the presence of a predator. However, the presence of a predator increased the mean outing index score of the highest ranked fish and decreased the number of fish that occupied lead positions, suggesting that risk amplified the behaviour of the boldest fish. Furthermore, the presence of the predator decreased individual willingness to leave the safety of cover. Thus, we show that the introduction of a predator influenced social group movement and that the boldest individuals emerge at the front of the group under risk.        Significance statement        Within social species, some bold individuals tend to occupy positions at the front of the group. Groups of goldfish were provided a safe covered refuge, and we recorded the order in which individuals left the refuge to enter an open water environment over multiple outings. We examined fish behaviour over 2 days: with and without a predator present. We found that the predator decreased the probability the fish would leave the safe refuge; however, relative individual fish behaviour and positioning were consistent over the 2 days. Interestingly, the presence of the predator amplified the behaviour of the boldest fish. Our results demonstrate that predation risk can influence group and individual prey behaviour and illustrate that bold individuals emerge at the front of groups when risk is high.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  4     Total Times Cited:  4     Cited Reference Count:  77 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s00265-018-2499-1     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Goldfish;Social group;Cohesion;Predator-prey;Consistency;Refuge;ANIMAL GROUPS;BODY-SIZE;COLLECTIVE BEHAVIOR;BOLDNESS;LEADERSHIP;ECOLOGY;PREY;EVOLUTION;SUCCESS;GAME;Prednisolone,,

In common-garden experiments, we exposed populations of two desert rodents to two different viper species, testing their ability to adjust to novel predators that use different hunting strategies. We aimed to understand whether both predators and prey with constraint-breaking adaptations actually manifest comparative advantage over their counterparts.        We used convergent species from desert dunes in the Mojave Desert in North America, Merriam's kangaroo rat Dipodomys merriami and the sidewinder rattlesnake Crotalus cerastes, and from the Negev Desert in the Middle East, the greater Egyptian gerbil Gerbillus pyramidum and the Saharan horned viper Cerastes cerastes. Both Mojave species hold constraint-breaking adaptations in relation to their counterparts from the Negev. The rattlesnakes have heat sensing organs (pits) and the kangaroo rats have fur-lined cheek pouches that allow for greater foraging efficiency and food preservation. Using patch-use theory, we evaluated the rodents' risk-assessment from each snake-separately, together and in combination with barn owls.        Initially each rodent species foraged less in the presence of its familiar snake, but within a month both foraged less in the presence of the pit-viper (sidewinder).        Our findings indicate a level of learning, and behavioural plasticity, in both rodents and ability to assess the risk from novel predators. The kangaroo rats were capable of harvesting far greater amounts of resources under the same conditions of elevated risk. However, the reason for their advantage may lie in bi-pedal agility and not only their ability collect food more efficiently.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  1     Total Times Cited:  1     Cited Reference Count:  76 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/1365-2656.13234     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),behavioural adaptations;common-garden experiments;convergent evolution;desert rodents;giving-up densities;invasive species;predator-prey interactions;risk managment;EVOLUTIONARY GAME-THEORY;FORAGING BEHAVIOR;SIDEWINDER RATTLESNAKES;DESERT RODENTS;PATCH USE;MICROHABITAT;FACILITATION;COMPETITION;PATTERNS;RISK;Prednisolone,,

We manipulated habitat complexity experienced by young pheasants (Phasianus colchicus) in their first seven weeks, adding a third accessible dimension by placing elevated perches in their rearing pens mimicking natural variation in habitat complexity. This simple manipulation provoked an interrelated suite of morphological, cognitive and behavioural changes, culminating in decreased wild mortality of birds from complex habitats compared with controls. Three mechanisms contribute to this: Pheasants reared with perches had a morphology which could enable them to fly to the higher branches and cope with prolonged roosting. They had a higher propensity to roost off the ground at night in the wild. More generally, these birds had more accurate spatial memory. Consequently, birds were at a reduced risk of terrestrial predation. The fitness consequences of variation in early rearing on behavioural development are rarely studied in the wild but we show that this is necessary because the effects can be broad ranging and not simple, depending on a complex interplay of behavioural, cognitive and morphological elements, even when effects that the treatments provoke are relatively short term and plastic.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  28     Total Times Cited:  29     Cited Reference Count:  64 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1098/rsos.160008     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),anti-predator behaviour;development;habitat complexity;roosting;spatial cognition;survival;RING-NECKED PHEASANTS;RISK-TAKING BEHAVIOR;LAYING HENS;PERCHING BEHAVIOR;BREEDING SUCCESS;SURVIVAL;WILD;COMPLEXITY;STRESS;ACCESS;Cognition,,

Together the results show the significant role environmental harshness plays in human cooperative dynamics and the species-unique cognition designed to support it.        It has been proposed that environmental stress acted as a selection pressure on the evolution of human cooperation. Through agent-based evolutionary modelling, mathematical analysis, and human experimental data we illuminate the mechanisms by which the environment influences cooperative success and decision making in a Stag Hunt game. The modelling and mathematical results show that only cooperative foraging phenotypes survive the harshest of environments but pay a penalty for miscoordination in favourable environments. When agents are allowed to coordinate their hunting intentions by communicating, cooperative phenotypes outcompete those who pursue individual strategies in almost all environmental and payoff scenarios examined. Data from human participants show flexible decision-making in face of cooperative uncertainty, favouring high-risk, high-reward strategy when environments are harsher and starvation is imminent. Converging lines of evidence from the three approaches indicate a significant role for environmental variability in human cooperative dynamics and the species-unique cognition designed to support it.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  1     Total Times Cited:  1     Cited Reference Count:  87 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1093/beheco/arab125     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),communication;cooperation;cost of living;environmental stress;resource accumulation;social foraging strategies;EVOLUTIONARY DYNAMICS;COORDINATION FAILURE;FEEDING-BEHAVIOR;PREDATION RISK;HUNT;GAMES;CHOICE;HUNGER;COST;FOOD;Humanities;Humanism;Humans,,

We examined the interplay within a carnivore community consisting of cougars, coyotes, black bears, and bobcats using contemporaneous Global Positioning System telemetry data from 51 individuals; diet analysis from 972 DNA-metabarcoded scats; and data from 128 physical investigations of cougar kill sites, 28 of which were monitored with remote cameras. Resource provisioning from competitively dominant cougars to coyotes through scavenging was so prolific as to be an overwhelming determinant of coyote behavior, space use, and resource acquisition. This was evident via the strong attraction of coyotes to cougar kill sites, frequent scavenging of cougar-killed prey, and coyote diets that nearly matched cougars in the magnitude of ungulate consumption. Yet coyotes were often killed by cougars and used space to minimize encounters, complicating the fitness benefits gained from scavenging. We estimated that 23% (95% CI: 8 to 55%) of the coyote population in our study area was killed by cougars annually, suggesting that coyote interactions with cougars are a complex behavioral game of risk and reward. In contrast, we found no indication that bobcat space use or diet was influenced by cougars. Black bears avoided cougars, but there was no evidence of attraction to cougar kill sites and much lower levels of ungulate consumption and carcass visitation than for coyotes. Interspecific interactions among carnivores are multifaceted, encompassing both suppression and facilitation.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  3     Total Times Cited:  3     Cited Reference Count:  53 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1073/pnas.2101614118     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),carnivore;facilitation;mesopredator release;scavenging;suppression;MESOPREDATOR RELEASE;RESOURCE SELECTION;ANIMAL MOVEMENT;BLACK BEARS;COMPETITION;FACILITATION;BEHAVIOR;COYOTES;WOLVES;SCAVENGERS;Reward,,

Depredation of nests and predation of chicks can be two of the most influential factors limiting their productivity. Prey species utilize antipredation behaviors, such as predator avoidance, to reduce the risk of predation. Birds in general balance the dual necessity of selecting cover to hide from visual and olfactory predators to enhance prospects of survival and reproductive success, which may also be achieved by selecting habitat with relatively fewer predators. We compared avian predator densities at Greater Sage-Grouse nests and brood locations with those at random locations within available sage-grouse habitat in Wyoming. This comparison allowed us to assess the species' ability to avoid avian predators during nesting and early brood rearing. During 2008-2010, we conducted 10-min point-count surveys at 218 nests, 249 brood locations from 83 broods, and 496 random locations. We found that random locations had higher densities of avian predators compared with nest and brood locations. Greater Sage-Grouse nested in areas where there were lower densities of Common Ravens (Corvus corax), Black-billed Magpies (Pica hudsonia), Golden Eagles (Aquila chrysaetos), and hawks (Buteo spp.) compared with random locations.

Although recent models suggest that the internal state of animals may be particularly important in tactic choice, the effects of state variables on the use of alternative behavioural forms have rarely been demonstrated. In this study, using experimental wind exposure to increase overnight energy expenditure, we show that flock-feeding house sparrows (Passer domesticus) with lowered energy reserves increase their use of scrounging (exploiting others' food findings) during their first feed of the day. This result is in accordance with the prediction of a state-dependent model of use of social foraging tactics. We also show that scrounging provides less variable feeding rates and patch finding times than the alternative tactic. These latter results support the theoretical assumption that scrounging is a risk-averse tactic, i.e. it reduces the risk of immediate starvation. As the level of energy reserves predicts the use of social foraging tactics, we propose that selection should favour individuals that monitor the internal state of flock mates and use this information to adjust their own tactic choice.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  56     Total Times Cited:  58     Cited Reference Count:  37 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1098/rspb.2004.2887     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),producer-scrounger game;state-variables;starvation risk;foraging strategies;house sparrow;Passer domesticus;BODY-MASS REGULATION;CAPTIVE FLOCKS;PREDATION RISK;DAILY PATTERNS;PRODUCER;WIND;DOMINANCE;GAME,,

Understanding specific responses to disturbances can help conservation management better protect wildlife populations to coexist with local communities. Here, we studied the response of a model ungulate species, the impala (Aepyceros melampus), to different types of human activities in the Serengeti ecosystem. Impala were studied in central Serengeti National Park (CSNP), an area with relatively low human disturbance, and, with increasing levels of human disturbance, in western Serengeti National Park (WSNP), Grumeti Game Reserve (GGR), Ikona Wildlife Management Area (IWMA), and Loliondo Game Controlled Area (LGCA); pastoralism and/or hunting are the main disturbances in these areas. We hypothesised that in the exploited GGR, IWMA and LGCA areas, 1) impala would spend more time on costly behaviours, 2) sex ratios would be more female skewed, and 3) group sizes, reproduction and recruitment ratios would be lower compared to CSNP. We found that impala spent less time resting in IWMA and LGCA, as well as a significantly lower proportion of males, and lower reproduction and recruitment ratios in LGCA. Impala synchronized their behaviour, increasing their social cohesion potentially resulting in more efficient anti-predator strategies. Human activities induced a behavioural response in impala, indicating that in less regulated areas where pastoralism and hunting are allowed, these disturbances can potentially affect impala population persistence. These results highlight the importance of protected areas for wildlife populations, and the need for continuous monitoring of the impala and other ungulate populations in less regulated areas, as the underlying anthropogenic disturbances are likely impacting diverse species.

However, conspecific populations often inhabit heterogeneous environments. This can determine local adaptations, and might also induce variation in antipredator responses. Nevertheless, there is limited information on whether heterogeneity of predation risk among populations determines variation in antipredator response. Here we studied the fire salamander, Salamandra salamandra, a species that can breed in both surface streams and caves, habitats that are predator-rich and predator-free, respectively, and measured differences in antipredator responses across populations with different predation risk. We combined field surveys and laboratory experiments to understand the role of predation risk on the activity patterns of larvae, while measuring behavioural differences between populations. We reared larvae from different habitats in safe and risky conditions and tested their response to predator cues before and after rearing. In the field, predation risk was much higher in surface streams than in caves; larvae moved more in the absence of predators and when the light intensity was low. During laboratory experiments, larvae were less active if reared in risky conditions, but cave larvae showed a stronger response to risk than stream larvae. Therefore, larvae from sites without predators showed higher antipredator responses than those from risky habitats. This response fits the predictions of the risk allocation model, in which prey from habitats with a high background level of risk need to be active even when predators are present, to satisfy their energetic demands. Our findings show that antipredator behaviour may differ strongly between populations and stress the importance of integrating this variability in studies on predatory responses.

While behaviors such as lethal predator control may impede predator restoration, other land management practices can facilitate coexistence between predators and humans. Socio-psychological theories provide useful tools for understanding and improving these human behaviors. We explore three frameworks to understand what shapes Australian livestock graziers' behaviors with regards to management of the threat that dingoes pose to livestock. These frameworks are the theory of reasoned action (incorporating values and beliefs about dingoes), the social identity approach, and perception of risk. We distributed a survey to Australian graziers by mail and online (n = 138) which allowed recording of information on these three frameworks and their engagement in lethal dingo control. Among the respondents, we found that all three frameworks were linked with lethal dingo control when assessed individually, but when combined in a hierarchical regression, only social identity (specifically, identifying as an ""environmentalist"" or ""pest controller"") was significant in predicting behavior. This result reveals the strength of social norms and normative beliefs over perceived risk in shaping behavior. As such, social identity is a useful metric for predicting and understanding environmental management behavior. Determining what these social identities mean in a given context is important for identifying how to implement behavior change to promote evidence-based management that facilitates restoration of wildlife such as predators to landscapes where conflict with humans occurs.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  7     Total Times Cited:  7     Cited Reference Count:  81 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/rec.13154     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),human-wildlife conflict;predator management;social identity approach;theory of reasoned action;wild dogs;ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION;ATTITUDES;DINGO;INTENTIONS;TOLERANCE;CONFLICTS;WILDLIFE;Self Psychology,,

In behavioral ecology, the prevalence of free riders can be predicted by a well-known game-theoretical model-the producer-scrounger (PS) model-where group members have the options to either search for resources (producers) or exploit the efforts of others (scroungers). The PS model has received some empirical support, but its predictions, surprisingly, are based on the strict assumption that only one resource can be exploited at a time. Yet, multiple simultaneous opportunities to exploit others' efforts should frequently occur in nature. Here, we combine analytic and simulation approaches to explore the effect of multiple simultaneous scrounging opportunities on tactic use. Our analyses demonstrate that scrounging rates should increase with the number of simultaneous opportunities. As such, the amount and spatial distribution (i.e., clumped vs. dispersed) of resources as well as the risk of predation are key predictors of scrounging behavior. Because scroungers contribute to reducing the speed of resource exploitation, the model proposed here has direct relevance to the exploitation and sustainability of renewable resources.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  1     Total Times Cited:  1     Cited Reference Count:  31 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1002/ece3.6201     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),evolutionary stable strategy;game theory;producer-scrounger game;simultaneous scrounging opportunities;stochastic effects;NUTMEG MANNIKINS;SCROUNGER USE;GROUP-SIZE;PRODUCER;INTERFERENCE;PROVISION,,

How predators and prey distribute themselves across space can have large population and community-level consequences by affecting the frequency and potential strength of interactions between and within trophic levels. The general pattern that emerges from numerous studies is that predators seek areas with higher prey densities and prey avoid areas with higher predation risk. However, little is known about the behavioural mechanisms underlying the emergent spatial patterns between freely interacting predators and prey.        2. We examined the behaviour and space use of groups of Pseudacris regilla (Pacific treefrog) tadpole prey and larval Rhionaeschna multicolor (blue-eyed darner) odonate predators in arenas consisting of four patches of the prey's resources divided into two spatial scales over two observation periods a day apart. Distributions were assayed both alone and together. We predicted scale should inherently affect the resulting spatial patterns because factors such as selection, competition, interference, movement ability and prey responses to predators all have potentially similar effects as scale become larger or smaller. These factors predict that prey should be more able to dictate the spatial pattern at smaller scales and predators at larger scales.        3. Results generally match these predictions with measures of joint space being consistent with the predators dictating the joint space use more than expected at the larger scale. Moreover, at the smaller scale, either the predator and prey responses offset or reverse to favour the prey. We used a model selection approach to look at the underlying behavioural rules shaping these spatial patterns. Prey were more likely to leave patches with lower resources across both scales. However, their response to predators and competitors differed between the scales, with prey appearing to become trapped with predators only at the larger scale and only avoiding other prey at the small scale.        4. These results highlight the importance of investigating freely interacting predators and prey and the factors that are likely to affect the predator's or prey's ability to dictate spatial patterns. An ability to predict predator-prey spatial outcomes should be a great benefit with habitat fragmentation and shifting population densities, distributions and community compositions.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  12     Total Times Cited:  13     Cited Reference Count:  52 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/j.1365-2435.2011.01949.x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),amphibian larvae;antipredator behaviour;game theory;ideal free distributions;model selection;odonate nymphs;patch use;predator-prey foraging games;IDEAL FREE DISTRIBUTION;HABITAT SELECTION;DENSITY-DEPENDENCE;PATCH CHOICE;RESPONSES;GAMES;RISK;AGGREGATION;DYNAMICS;ECOLOGY;Continental Population Groups;Prednisolone,,

While the proactive responses of large herbivores to the risk of predation have been well documented, the reactive responses of prey following encounters have been less well studied and restricted mostly to northern temperate ecosystems. We postulated that the reactive response should depend on the habitat selection of the prey species as well as the hunting tactic (cursorial versus stalking) of the predator. We investigated the reactive responses of a selective grazer, the blue wildebeest, Connochaetes taurinus, and a generalist grazer, the plains zebra, Equus quagga, to encounters with lions, Panthera leo, their main predator, in Kruger National Park. We used simultaneous global positioning system (GPS) locations of prey and predators to identify encounters and assess their frequency and characteristics (e.g. time of day). We compared both the immediate response (stay or flee) and subsequent movement (remain in the habitat patch or relocate) of the two ungulate species following encounters with lions. Despite being more predictably located in open short grass areas, wildebeest encountered lions no more frequently than zebra. However, being more selective for these particular habitat types, wildebeest more often stayed near the encounter site than zebra. Specifically, wildebeest were less likely to leave when located in more open areas with short grass providing both high-quality food and little concealment for stalking lions. We suggest that this is because wildebeest incur higher risks and greater feeding costs than zebra should they relocate, owing to their narrower preference for areas of short grass.

Predation and thermal risks, however, can make foraging a costly endeavor and foraging can preclude other important activities. Moreover, seasonal life cycle events such as hibernation impose energetic thresholds and time constraints on foraging. These factors interact with an animal's endogenous state to influence foraging behavior. We tested a suite of predictions based on foraging theory to explore the effects of thermal environment, body condition, and conspecific density on aboveground activity (which is primarily foraging activity) of the northern Idaho ground squirrel (Urocitellus brunneus), an imperiled rodent that hibernates for 9 months each year. We took advantage of the squirrels' semi-fossorial lifestyle to document daily aboveground activity by attaching geolocators to squirrels. We modeled squirrel activity with generalized linear mixed-effects models to document the relative importance of thermal environment, body condition, and conspecific density for daily aboveground activity. Aboveground activity by northern Idaho ground squirrels increased throughout their active season and leaner squirrels increased their activity more than heavier squirrels as residual foraging opportunities diminished. Thermal conditions also influenced squirrel activity: squirrels spent less time above ground during extreme temperatures and on days with significant precipitation. Aboveground activity of northern Idaho ground squirrels largely adhered to predictions of risk-sensitive and state-dependent foraging theory. Management actions that enhance forage will likely improve the probability of recovery for this federally threatened species by minimizing trade-offs squirrels need to make to acquire sufficient food to survive hibernation and reproduce in subsequent years. Significance statement Acquiring food is a vital task for wild animals, but foraging can be dangerous. Hibernation imposes annual energetic requirements animals must meet within a short time when food is available and the animal is active. Hibernating species, therefore, must navigate trade-offs among foraging, predation risk, and thermal intolerance. We investigated how these pressures influence daily foraging activity of the northern Idaho ground squirrel (Urocitellus brunneus), a federally threatened species. Ground squirrels forage above ground during the active season and retreat to burrows to avoid predation and extreme weather but accept greater risks to forage as hibernation approaches. Additionally, lean squirrels with high energetic needs forage more than heavy squirrels, exposing lean squirrels to higher predation risk. Improving forage may improve recovery odds for this imperiled species by allowing squirrels to reduce their mortality risk.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  1     Total Times Cited:  1     Cited Reference Count:  113 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s00265-022-03142-4     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Optimal foraging;Risk sensitivity;State dependence;Hibernation;Geolocator;Ground squirrel;DAILY ACTIVITY PATTERNS;PREDATION RISK;TRADE-OFF;TIME ALLOCATION;SPERMOPHILUS-BRUNNEUS;GROUP-SIZE;OVERWINTER SURVIVAL;BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY;MODEL SELECTION;FOOD RESOURCES,,

Studies have shown that seabird and prey distribution seldom conforms with this prediction. In this study, I review recent theoretical advances in spatial predator-prey interactions and relate these with studies of seabirds and pelagic schooling fish and crustaceans. Studies on seabirds and prey have generally assumed that prey are nonresponsive. Predator-prey interactions should, however, be viewed as a 2-way spatial game where seabirds track concentrations of prey while prey move away from areas with high risk of predation. The outcome of the game depends on how seabirds and prey are spatially constrained. Constraints include the spatial distribution of resources, interspecific competition, the location of spawning and breeding areas, and limitations on diving depth. Although game theoretic models can explain some general aspects of the spatial interaction, the spatial distribution of seabirds and prey is generally much more aggregated and elusive than can be expected from the game theoretic equilibrium. This is because spatial pattern is formed through self-organizing behavior that includes schooling, local enhancement and area-restricted search (ARS). Schooling and local enhancement are processes with strong positive density dependence that destabilize the predator-prey interaction locally. However, the unstable local dynamics might be stabilized by spatial constraints and the effects of ARS processes at large scales.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  116     Total Times Cited:  120     Cited Reference Count:  109 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.3354/meps07818     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Game model;Schooling;Local enhancement;Area-restricted search;Euphausia superba;Mallotus villosus;Clupea spp.;Diomedea spp.;Uria spp.;Rissa tridactyla;HIERARCHICAL PATCH DYNAMICS;DEPENDENT HABITAT SELECTION;INTRA-SPECIFIC COMPETITION;ANTARCTIC KRILL;PRIBILOF ISLANDS;PRODUCTIVITY GRADIENT;GEOGRAPHIC STRUCTURE;COMMUNITY STRUCTURE;DENSITY-DEPENDENCE;FORAGING HABITAT,,

Despite several predictions of these models are supported by experimental findings, they have focused mainly on animals that can copy others' decisions, without paying a cost. Yet, the acquisition or exploitation of social information is likely to be costly in many cases, notably when animals compete for depleting resources: social learners then cannot directly copy the decision of others but instead acquire generalized preferences through observation and hence suffer a risk of being unable to use the information previously collected. To explore the conditions that should favor this form of copying (i.e., acquisition of generalized preferences), we developed a mate-choice model with 2 strategies: selective females assess potential partners until they have found an acceptable mate, whereas copier females observe their mating decisions and then search for a male similar in appearance to the accepted mates. Our results indicate that the extent to which animals should rely on personal information logically increases with the costs entailed by social information use, and the proportion of asocial learners can even reach fixation. Furthermore, as the costs of using both personal and social information are frequency dependent on the proportion of social and asocial learners, there are conditions where both strategies coexist within the population, although social information use may lead to maladaptive decisions.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  16     Total Times Cited:  16     Cited Reference Count:  45 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1093/beheco/arr179     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),acquisition of generalized preferences;cultural transmission;frequency dependence;mate-choice copying;social learning;GUPPY POECILIA-RETICULATA;FEMALE MATE-CHOICE;PUBLIC INFORMATION;SEXUAL SELECTION;PREDATION RISK;EVOLUTION;COPY;OTHERS,,

This balance is particularly true for gallinaceous birds, such as the northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus), which are ground foragers and are often exposed to increased predation risk compared to arboreal foragers. We studied how bobwhites might mitigate the threat of human hunting pressure by altering their foraging strategy. We directly monitored hunting encounters with bobwhites, during October 2014-March 2015, and collected daily movement paths (n=514) using radio-telemetry. We performed first-passage time analysis to infer foraging behavior by calculating bout frequency, area, duration, and timing. We found bobwhites mitigated exposure to human hunters by increasing foraging frequency coupled with a decrease in duration (15.4%) and area (7.1%) in response to hunting pressure. We observed a temporal shift in foraging away from peak hunting hours by 30minutes when birds were recently exposed to a discharged firearm. Our results imply that hunting game species can disrupt timing of foraging and therefore influence allocation to competing activities such as anti-predator vigilance. We propose implementing a dynamic harvest management regime that distributes hunting activity temporally and spatially to mitigate high hunting pressure and reduce behavioral effects on bobwhites. Careful planning of hunting activity should reduce its additive effects on natural mortality while improving hunter satisfaction. (c) 2018 The Wildlife Society.        Northern bobwhites altered their foraging in response to increased levels of hunting pressure in an intensely managed landscape such that bobwhites increased the frequency of foraging but decreased the duration and area foraged. Our results imply that anthropogenic disturbances such as hunting pressure, can lead to disruption of time allocated to foraging; therefore, we suggest distributing the spatial and temporal concentration of hunting evenly throughout the hunting season.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  6     Total Times Cited:  6     Cited Reference Count:  58 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1002/jwmg.21451     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),anthropogenic disturbance;behavior;Colinus virginianus;first-passage time;foraging;hunting pressure;northern bobwhite;predation risk;PREDATION RISK;1ST-PASSAGE TIME;HABITAT USE;GASTROINTESTINAL-TRACT;ANTIPREDATOR RESPONSE;BEHAVIOR;SELECTION;AVOIDANCE;FEAR;OVERFLIGHTS,,

How ungulates prioritize safety from predators at the expense of high-quality foraging opportunities during calving may be key to understanding these shifts and long-term reproductive success. We compared trade-offs in selection for forage and predation risk by elk (Cervus canadensis) following 3 migratory tactics (western and eastern migration and resident) during 2 time periods in a declining (by almost 70% from 2002-2016), partially migratory elk population adjacent to Banff National Park in Alberta, Canada. We hypothesized that regardless of migratory tactic, maternal elk would show stronger trade-offs between high-quality foraging associated with higher predation risk and forage resources of lower-quality yet lower risk on calving ranges than on ranges used during summer because of vulnerability of their offspring. Additionally, we hypothesized these trade-offs would occur at high (2002-2006) and low (2013-2016) elk population sizes. We used a machine-learning algorithm to predict dates of parturition based on global positioning system (GPS) movements of elk equipped with vaginal implants (n = 60) and predictions were within 1.43 +/- 0.85 (SE) days of the known date. We applied the model to an additional 58 GPS-collared elk without vaginal implants. Based on changes in localized movements, we defined calving areas as the 26 days post-parturition and compared habitat characteristics of calving areas to 10 similar-sized areas centered on random locations during summer for the same individual in a latent selection framework. Across the 2 time periods, parturition occurred from 8 May-11 July with median parturition dates differing among migratory tactics and residents shifting towards an earlier parturition date in the later period. All elk, regardless of migratory tactic and time period, selected calving areas with greater forage resources than were available on areas used during summer, with no evidence for greater selection of areas that reduced predation risk at the expense of higher-quality foraging. Calving season selection for areas with abundant forage exposed western migrants to high risk of bear (Ursus spp.) predation, residents to high risk of wolf (Canis lupus) predation, and eastern migrants to low risk of bear and wolf predation. Patterns in exposure to predation risk during calving between migratory tactics were consistent with the recent decline in western migrants and increase in eastern migrants, implying that conditions on calving areas contributed to observed changes in the number of elk following these tactics.

Studies have shown that individuals often adjust their signaling behavior in the presence of predators with consequences for current reproductive opportunities. Predation risk, however, can vary over time and is rarely (if ever) constant. Despite this, surprisingly little is known about how recent exposure to a predator might influence an individual's subsequent signaling behavior. Here, we set out to determine how a previous encounter with a piscivorous predator affected courtship behavior in a freshwater fish, the desert goby, Chlamydogobius eremius. We tested male courtship before and after manipulating their perception of risk. We found that male gobies previously exposed to a predatory fish, the spangled perch, Leiopotherapon unicolor, took longer to initiate courtship and subsequently spent less time courting females. Such males, instead, spent more time taking refuge in their nests. In contrast, unexposed control male gobies and males that were exposed to a nonpredatory fish, the Lake Eyre Hardyhead, Craterocephalus eyresii, did not alter their courtship behavior. Our results suggest that male courtship behavior is not only sensitive to the immediate presence of a predator but can persist even after the predatory threat has abated.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  13     Total Times Cited:  13     Cited Reference Count:  45 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1093/beheco/aru056     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),courtship;mate choice;predation risk;sexual selection;GUPPY POECILIA-RETICULATA;MALE SIGNALING EFFORT;FIDDLER-CRAB;WOLF SPIDER;MATE CHOICE;BIASED PREDATION;WAITING GAME;RISK;BEHAVIOR;COST,,

Therefore, we hypothesized that disturbances from small and big game hunting may have negative effects on moose movements, diurnal activity, and activity range. Using location data from 64 moose equipped with GPS collars from three populations (Low Alpine, Inland, Coastal) with different temporal human presence and spatial accessibility, we evaluated the impact of hunting on moose activity rhythms. On average, female moose in the low human population density (Low Alpine) area (< 0.5/km(2)) had significantly lower movement rates during moose hunting season, but variation in movement rates among individuals were higher compared with female moose in regions with denser human populations (6-24/km(2)). We found no evidence that reproductive status influenced female moose sensitivity to disturbance. As expected, females used smaller activity ranges and were less active nocturnally than males. The high within-group variation suggests that current hunting disturbance levels do not alter moose population behavior in general. Our data indicate that alterations in movement were related to rutting activity, not human disturbance induced by hunting. In line with behavioral theory, our study suggests that some individuals were more sensitive to hunting disturbance than the general population. Our work suggests that individual moose may perceive human predation risk to be similar to other predation risks.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  21     Total Times Cited:  21     Cited Reference Count:  76 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s10344-008-0237-0     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Human disturbance;Temporal/spatial;Predation risk;Sweden;Ungulate;YELLOWSTONE-NATIONAL-PARK;SEXUAL SEGREGATION;ANTIPREDATOR BEHAVIOR;REPRODUCTIVE EFFORT;WOODLAND CARIBOU;PREDATION RISK;ALASKAN MOOSE;FALLOW DEER;ELK;RESPONSES;Movement,,

Among these, time allocation is foremost, followed by vigilance and apprehension. Together, their use influences a forager's time allocation and giving-up density (GUD) in depletable resource patches. We examined Allenby's gerbils (Gerbilus andersoni allenbyi) exploiting seed resource patches in a large vivarium under varying moon phases in the presence of a red fox (Vulpes vulpes). We measured time allocated to foraging patches electronically and GUDs from seeds left behind in resource patches. From these, we estimated handling times, attack rates and quitting harvest rates (QHRs). Gerbils displayed greater vigilance (lower attack rates) at brighter moon phases (full < wane < wax new). Similarly, they displayed higher GUDs at brighter moon phases (wax > full > new > wane). Finally, gerbils displayed higher QHRs at new and waxing moon phases. Differences across moon phases not only reflect changing time allocation and vigilance, but changes in the state of the foragers and their marginal value of energy. Early in the lunar cycle, gerbils rely on vigilance and sacrifice state to avoid risk; later they defend state at the cost of increased time allocation; finally their state can recover as safe opportunities expand. In the predator-prey foraging game, foxes may contribute to these patterns of behaviours by modulating their own activity in response to the opportunities presented in each moon phase.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  157     Total Times Cited:  158     Cited Reference Count:  37 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1098/rspb.2009.2036     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),foraging theory;risk management;time allocation and vigilance;state-dependent foraging;moonlight avoidance;gerbils;PATCH USE;PREDATION RISK;OPTIMAL FORAGERS;BEHAVIOR;HABITAT;APPREHENSION;COEXISTENCE;RATES;FOOD;ENVIRONMENT;Gerbillinae,,

Cue transmission of information within a group cannot easily be tracked in the field, but can be studied by modelling. An unintentional visual cue can be given by a fleeing action, and when it occurs in the visual field of an individual, can by contagion incite it to flee as well, making such a cue functional in anti-predator warning. The visual field is limited not only by morphology, causing a blind angle at the back, but also by behaviour. For instance, foraging with the head down can cause an extra ""blind"" angle in front for cues from other individuals, changing an unobstructed frontal visual field to a split lateral shape.        The questions of the present study are: how do visual fields, in terms of their size and blind angles, influence survival of individuals in a group through their effect on non-attentional reception of cues to danger among group members after attentional detection of a predator, and how can we quantify this?        We use an agent-based spatially explicit model to investigate the effect of contagious fleeing after detection of predators on survival rate. This model is a bottom-up model of foraging agents in a simple environment, where only assumptions about basic competences are made. We vary the size and the shape of the visual field (lateral, with the additional frontal ""blind"" angle, versus a frontal continuous view), the group size, the movement probability, and the style of movement (regular movement or start-stop movement) in residential groups. We devise a measure for the transmission rate and we measure the length of the transmission chains.        We find that, as expected, in a residential group, a larger visual field enhances survival rate. Moreover, a lateral field is more effective than a frontal field of the same total size because it increases the field of vision and therefore the non-attentional reception of visual cues about danger during, for instance, foraging, for all but the largest visual fields. This is demonstrated by the higher transmission rates and longer chains of transmission for lateral fields. Better transmission for lateral visual fields results in more synchronized fleeing behaviour. As long as the visual field is large enough, having a blind angle in front does not detract from sufficiently effective transmission. These findings should be taken into account in empirical studies of vigilance in groups of foraging animals.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  46 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2020.109073     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),"Spatially explicit agent-based model;Visual fields;Vigilance;Indirect information reception;Non-attentional information reception;Sociality, Group living;VIGILANCE BEHAVIOR;ANTIPREDATORY VIGILANCE;COLLECTIVE DETECTION;SOCIAL INFORMATION;GROUP-SIZE;DILUTION;PROTOCOL;NUMBERS;SAFETY;ACUITY;Prednisolone",,

Despite being evaluated extensively in terrestrial systems, quantifying and characterizing the role predation plays in upper trophic marine ecosystems is challenging due to the cryptic nature of pelagic predators and the difficulty of observing predatory behavior. We developed a multi-step method to characterize habitat associated with predation that integrates data from post-mortem pop-up style mortality transmitters, and data from traditional external tracking devices, both of which use the Argos satellite system. In our case study with juvenile Steller sea lions (SSL, Eumetopias jubatus) in the Gulf of Alaska, 20mortality events were previously described, of which 18 were attributed to predation. The locations of 13 of these at-sea predation events with post-mortem tracking data were estimated, with spatial uncertainty calculated using movement-based approaches of backwards step-length and state-space modeling. We then generated a Mortality Occurrence Probability Distribution (MOPD), resampled points within the MOPD based on isopleth weighting, and extracted habitat variables (i.e., slope, depth, distance to haulout-rookery) associated with these locations. This final dataset represented ""case"" points (n = 115) in terms of predation and was compared to the habitat associated with ""control"" points (n = 1000), locations within juvenile SSL distribution in this region (i.e., population home range), in a resource-selection function (GAM). Predation events were associated with habitats characterized by greater depths and moderate distances from SSL haulouts and rookeries. This information enabled us to generate a risk-map for juvenile SSL in the Gulf of Alaska, spatially representing areas of high predation probability. Our study provides important information about threats to this vulnerable age-class, and establishes a novel approach to characterizing risk in marine ecosystems that can be applied to other management and ecosystem concerns.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  2     Total Times Cited:  2     Cited Reference Count:  54 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.3389/fmars.2020.576716     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),risk;habitat modeling;predator-prey;LHX tags;marine mammals;SATELLITE ARCHIVAL TAGS;PACIFIC SLEEPER SHARK;LANDSCAPE;FEAR;BEHAVIOR;TRANSMITTER;DECISIONS;SEASCAPES;SELECTION;SURVIVAL;Military Personnel;Prednisolone,,

However, because food abundance and predation risk often covary in nature, few studies have separated their effects or tested whether different phenotypic traits respond to the same sources of environmental variation. We investigated patterns of parental investment and behavior over a 7-year period in 2 island populations of orange-crowned warblers (Oreothlypis celata) that showed little genetic divergence but experienced dramatic temporal variation in rainfall and spatial variation in nest predation risk. The amount of rainfall in each year was correlated with food abundance, and birds on both islands initiated breeding earlier and laid larger clutches in wetter years. In contrast, the rate at which parents visited their nests was not affected by rainfall but was negatively correlated with nest predation risk both within and between islands. Our results suggest that although the effects of food availability and nest predation have been viewed as mutually exclusive drivers of entire suites of life-history and behavioral traits, these traits can differ in their sensitivity to resource abundance or mortality risk, and traits that are often correlated can be decoupled under appropriate environmental conditions.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  33     Total Times Cited:  33     Cited Reference Count:  84 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1093/beheco/ars212     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),breeding phenology;clutch size;life-history strategies;parental care;phenotypic plasticity;CLUTCH SIZE;PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY;SPATIAL HETEROGENEITY;POPULATION-STRUCTURE;VISITATION RATES;SITE SELECTION;DARWINS FINCH;BIRDS;EVOLUTION;RAINFALL;Prednisolone,,

Individuals can therefore face a trade-off between reproduction and predation risk. Here we use simple models to explore population-dynamical consequences of such a trade-off for populations subject to a mate-finding Allee effect and an Allee effect due to predation. We present our results in the light of populations that belong to endangered species or pests and study their viability and resilience. We distinguish several qualitative scenarios characterized by the shape and strength of the trade-off and, in particular, identify conditions for which the populations survive or go extinct. Reproduction can be so costly that the population always goes extinct. In other cases, the population goes extinct only over a certain range of low, intermediate or high levels of reproductive activities. Moreover, we show that predator removal (e.g. in an attempt to save an endangered prey species) has the least effect on populations with low cost of reproduction in terms of predation and, conversely, predator addition (e.g. to eradicate a pest) is most effective for populations with high predation cost of reproduction. Our results indicate that a detailed knowledge of the trade-off can be crucial in applications: for some trade-off shapes, only intermediate levels of reproductive activities might guarantee population survival, while they can lead to extinction for others. We therefore suggest that the fate of populations subject to the two antagonistic Allee effects should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Although the literature offers no quantitative data on possible trade-off shapes in any taxa, indirect evidence suggests that the trade-off and both Allee effects can occur simultaneously, e.g. in the golden egg bug Phyllomorpha laciniata.

Animals use sensory systems to detect predator cues, but the relationship between the tuning of sensory systems and the sensory cues related to predator threat are not well-studied at the community level. Noctuid moths have ultrasound-sensitive ears to detect the echolocation calls of predatory bats. Here, combining empirical data and mathematical modelling, we show that moth hearing is adapted to provide information about the threat posed by different sympatric bat species. First, we found that multiple characteristics related to the threat posed by bats to moths correlate with bat echolocation call frequency. Second, the frequency tuning of the most sensitive auditory receptor in noctuid moth ears provides information allowing moths to escape detection by all sympatric bats with similar safety margin distances. Third, the least sensitive auditory receptor usually responds to bat echolocation calls at a similar distance across all moth species for a given bat species. If this neuron triggers last-ditch evasive flight, it suggests that there is an ideal reaction distance for each bat species, regardless of moth size. This study shows that even a very simple sensory system can adapt to deliver information suitable for triggering appropriate defensive reactions to each predator in a multiple predator community.

I considered a predator population in which individuals play the producer-scrounger foraging game in one-prey-one-predator and two-prey-onepredator systems. I analysed the stability of a coexisting equilibrium point in the one-prey system and that of nonequilibrium dynamics in the two-prey system. The results revealed that social foraging could stabilize both systems, and thereby resolve the paradox of enrichment when scrounging behaviour (i.e. kleptoparasitism) is prevalent in predators.

However, are there more serious ecological consequences of infection, such as effects on foraging aptitudes and risk management? We tested two alternatives: the nutrient compensation hypothesis (does nutrient deficiency induce infected gerbils to make up for the shortfall by foraging more and taking greater risks?) and (2) the lethargy hypothesis (do sick gerbils forage less, and are they compromised in their ability to detect predators or risky microhabitats?). We compared the foraging and risk management behavior of infected and noninfected gerbils. We experimentally infected gerbils with the bacteria, which allowed us to compare between noninfected, acutely infected (peak infection loads), and chronically infected (low infection loads) individuals. Our findings supported the lethargy hypothesis over the nutrient compensation hypothesis. Infected individuals incurred dramatically elevated foraging costs, including less efficient foraging, diminished ""quality"" of time spent vigilant, and increased owl predation. Interestingly, gerbils that were chronically infected (lower bacteria load) experienced larger ecological costs than acutely infected individuals (i.e., peak infection loads). This suggests that the debilitating effects of infection occur gradually, with a progressive decline in the quality of time gerbils allocated to foraging and managing risk. These increased long-term costs of infection demonstrate how small direct physiological costs of infection can lead to large indirect ecological costs. The indirect ecological costs of this parasite appear to be much greater than the direct physiological costs.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  2     Total Times Cited:  2     Cited Reference Count:  52 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1086/711397     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),behaviorally mediated indirect effects;gerbils;giving-up densities (GUDs);microbes;microhabitats;patch use;PATCH USE;TIME ALLOCATION;PREDATION RISK;HIDDEN COSTS;INFECTION;PARASITES;RATES;MYCOPLASMAS;COEXISTENCE;DIVERSITY;Risk Management;Gerbillinae,,

We determined whether TMIIs occur in rocky tidepool communities on the west coast of the USA. In the laboratory, both adults and juveniles of the keystone predator Pisaster ochraceus and adults of a smaller predatory seastar Leptasterias spp. caused the abundant herbivorous snail Tegula funebralis to stop foraging and flee the water, inducing a positive TMII on micro-and macroalgae. Snails preferred 3 common species of macroalgae (Ulva lactuca, Cladophora columbiana and Porphyra spp.) over 4 others, indicating that seastars might provide the strongest benefits to these species in tidepools. In the laboratory, snails responded rapidly to both species of predatory seastars and many more snails responded than could be eaten; thus, there is a potential for TMIIs to occur in natural populations. Snails responded to waterborne cues from P. ochraceus by reducing grazing and leaving still water, and reducing grazing in laminar flow (0.5 l min(-1)), resulting in TMII effects at least as far as 75 cm away. Adult P. ochraceus and Leptasterias spp. introduced to tidepools during low tide induced many snails to flee the tidepools. Considerable individual variation occurred in the responses of snails. Medium and large snails mediated TMIIs and hungry snails were marginally less responsive to seastars potentially altering TMII strength in nature. Thus, we demonstrated that TMIIs could occur in natural tidepools and showed how predator and algal identity, predator and prey size, water flow and prey hunger level may influence these TMIIs.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  14     Total Times Cited:  14     Cited Reference Count:  84 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.3354/meps11766     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Trait-mediated indirect interaction;Predator-prey interaction;Chemical cue Community structure;Rocky intertidal tidepools;Nonconsumptive effect;PREDATOR-PREY INTERACTIONS;SNAIL TEGULA-FUNEBRALIS;ANTIPREDATOR BEHAVIOR;COMMUNITY STRUCTURE;FOOD-WEB;ECOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES;INTERTIDAL COMMUNITY;RELATIVE IMPORTANCE;AVOIDANCE-RESPONSE;MARINE GASTROPOD,,

Behavioral algorithms based on life-time optimization, adaptive dynamics or game theory are unsuited for large global models because of their high computational demand. We compare an easily integrated, computationally efficient behavioral algorithm known as Gilliam's rule against the solution from a life-history optimization. The approximation takes into account only the current conditions to optimize behavior; the so-called ""myopic approximation"", ""short sighted"", or ""static optimization"". We explore the performance of the myopic approximation with diel vertical migration (DVM) as an example of a daily routine, a behavior with seasonal dependence that trades off predation risk with foraging opportunities in aquatic environments. The myopic approximation proves to be a robust replacement for the life-history optimization, deviating only up to 25% in regions of strong seasonality. The myopic approximation has additional advantages in that it can readily accommodate density dependence and inter-annual variations, aspects that can only be accessed in dynamic programming approaches with escalating computational costs. Furthermore, the explanatory power of the myopic approximation is notably higher than when behavior is not implemented, highlighting the importance for adaptive DVM behavior in ecological models where techniques such as dynamic programming are simply too computational demanding to be implemented.

However, when a recolonizing predator enters an already complex predator-prey system, specific antipredator behaviors may conflict and avoidance of one predator may enhance vulnerability to another. We studied the patterns of prey selection by recolonizing wolves (Canis lupus) and cougars (Puma concolor) in response to prey resource selection in the northern Madison Range, Montana, USA. Elk (Cervus elaphus) were the primary prey for wolves, and male deer (Odocoileus hemionus) were the primary prey for cougars, but elk made up an increasingly greater proportion of cougar kills annually. Although both predators preyed disproportionately on male elk, wolves were most likely to prey on males in poor physical condition. Although we found that the predators partitioned hunting habitats, structural complexity at wolf kill sites increased over time, whereas complexity of cougar kill sites decreased. We concluded that shifts by prey to structurally complex refugia were attempts by formerly naive prey to lessen predation risk from wolves; nevertheless, shifting to more structurally complex refugia might have made prey more vulnerable to cougars. After a change in predator exposure, use of refugia may represent a compromise to minimize overall risk. As agencies formulate management strategies relative to wolf recolonization, the potential for interactive predation effects (i.e., facilitation or antagonism) should be considered.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  56     Total Times Cited:  57     Cited Reference Count:  52 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.2193/2006-102     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),antipredator behavior;canid;cougar;felid;habitat;refugia;risk;wolf;GLACIER NATIONAL-PARK;WHITE-TAILED DEER;PREY SELECTION;TEMPORAL PATTERNS;BEHAVIOR;VIGILANCE;RISK;SIZE;SURVIVAL;GAZELLES;Prednisolone,,

For example, models of predation events for moving prey groups predict higher mortality risk for individuals at the periphery and front of groups. We investigated these predictions in sardine (Sardinella aurita) schools under attack from group hunting sailfish (Istiophorus platypterus) in the open ocean. Sailfish approached sardine schools about equally often from the front and rear, but prior to attack there was a chasing period in which sardines attempted to swim away from the predator. Consequently, all sailfish attacks were directed at the rear and peripheral positions of the school, resulting in higher predation risk for individuals at these positions. During attacks, sailfish slash at sardines with their bill causing prey injury including scale removal and tissue damage. Sardines injured in previous attacks were more often found in the rear half of the school than in the front half. Moreover, injured fish had lower tail-beat frequencies and lagged behind uninjured fish. Injuries inflicted by sailfish bills may, therefore, hinder prey swimming speed and drive spatial sorting in prey schools through passive self-assortment. We found only partial support for the theoretical predictions from current predator-prey models, highlighting the importance of incorporating more realistic predator-prey dynamics into these models.

For instance, under low predation risk, highly ornamented individuals might display better parental performance than others, as predicted by good parent' models of sexual selection. However, under high risk of predation, highly ornamented individuals might abandon parental effort if conspicuous to predators, or if social partners are more willing to take parental risks when paired with highly ornamented mates. We experimentally elevated perceived adult-directed predation risk near nests to explore how carotenoid- and phaeomelanin-based pigmentation in both sexes relate to parental risk-taking for offspring in the yellow warbler Setophaga petechia. Compared to other males, males with more intense carotenoid-based pigmentation maintained higher levels of paternal effort under predation risk at highly concealed nests, but reduced nestling provisioning rate more at exposed nests. Further, when faced with predation risk, females with more phaeomelanin-based pigmentation reduced nestling provisioning rate less than other females, regardless of nest concealment. Females displayed higher parental effort across treatments when paired to males with more colorful carotenoid pigmentation. However, birds did not reduce parental effort under risk less when paired to a highly ornamented mate, suggesting that predation risk did not accentuate differential allocation. Males did not take fewer parental risks than females. Results indicate that nest concealment modifies parental risk-taking by males with colorful carotenoid-based pigmentation, and suggest that female melanin-based pigmentation may indicate boldness and greater a propensity to take parental risks.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  6     Total Times Cited:  6     Cited Reference Count:  64 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/jav.00496     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),PLUMAGE COLORATION;PREDATION RISK;DIFFERENTIAL ALLOCATION;REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS;PATERNAL CARE;2 POPULATIONS;NEST DEFENSE;MELANIN;INVESTMENT;SELECTION;Risk-Taking,,

However, as any other model organisms, the use of zebrafish in classroom settings requires additional experimental resources and poses ethical challenges related to animal use. To mitigate these factors, we have developed an application (app), simUfish, which implements a mathematical model of zebrafish behavior for generating multiple fish trajectories and animating their body undulations. simUfish is developed using a multiplatform game engine and is expected to promote the knowledge of zebrafish behavior to both K-12 students and the general public. Specifically, it demonstrates basic principles of fish individual and social behaviors, including environment interaction; fear response toward a predator; shoaling; and attraction toward a stimulus, which can be a food source or simply a finger placed on the touch screen. The effectiveness of the app as an accessible experimental tool for learning was tested in an outreach activity on middle school students from the New York City school system.

Recognizing these changes can thus allow prey to make optimal decisions by projecting risk trends into the future. We used tadpoles (Lithobates sylvaticus) to test the hypothesis that tadpoles can extrapolate information about predation risk from past information. We exposed tadpoles to an odour that represented either a temporally consistent risk or an increasing risk. When tested for their response to the odour, the initial antipredator behaviour of tadpoles did not differ, appearing to approach the limit of their maximum response, but exposure to increasing risk induced longer retention of these responses. When repeating the experiment using lower risk levels, heightened responses occurred for tadpoles exposed to increasing risk, and the strongest responses were exhibited by those that received an abrupt increase compared to a steady increase. Our results indicate that tadpoles can assess risk trends through time and adjust their antipredator responses in a way consistent with an extrapolated trend.

Dams selected for sites with decreased vegetation height, potentially improving their visibility, which may increase their ability to escape approaching predators. Conversely, there was no variation between vegetative characteristics at neonate bed sites and their associated random sites, indicating grasslands provide adequate concealment for neonates. Dams possess the ability to flee from approaching predators, thus increasing the importance of visibility while giving birth. Conversely, neonates depend on fear bradycardia as their main antipredator defense, so concealment is more important.

One consistent prediction made by such models is that the spatial distribution of prey should be mainly determined by the inherent habitat riskiness ( e. g. cover level), with prey avoiding the inherently riskier habitats regardless ( or nearly so) of resource distribution. To test this prediction, we conducted laboratory experiments in which both predators (creek chub, Semotilus atromaculatus) and prey ( northern redbelly dace, Phoxinus eos) were free to move between feeding patches differing in resource quantity and habitat riskiness. When alone, creek chub and northern redbelly dace both preferred the more food-rich patch. The spatial distribution of dace was also inversely related to that of creek chub in the presence of chub fenced into feeding patches. When the patches differed in both riskiness and resource quantity, the spatial distribution of dace was mainly influenced by resource distribution and, to a lesser extent, by the inherent habitat riskiness in the absence of predators. In the presence of creek chub, the dace significantly decreased their use of the inherently riskier patch compared to when predators were absent. However, contrary to the models' prediction, food distribution still significantly influenced dace distribution when predators were present. Finally, dace aggregated increasingly in a third, totally safe area ( but one offering no food) as the number of chub present in both patches increased.

The possible mechanisms driving these effects can be two-fold. Firstly, a preference for a certain demographic class results in selective predation by a predator. Secondly, different demographic classes exhibit varied behaviour and thus susceptibility to predation risk. To test these mechanisms, a study was conducted on Samara Private Game Reserve to investigate the potential impact cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) predation has had on the kudu (Tragelaphus strepciseros) population. Kudu age and sex data were collected across both predator-present and predator-absent sections using a spotlight-count method. Results suggest that juvenile kudu and subadult male kudu are selectively hunted by cheetah. This was reflected in significantly lower proportions of these two demographic classes within the predator-present section (both 6.0%, respectively) compared with the predator-absent section (16.8% and 17.4%, respectively). These findings indicate that the shift in the demographics of the kudu population within Samara could be explained by a combination of these two mechanisms.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  2     Total Times Cited:  2     Cited Reference Count:  25 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1080/15627020.2016.1266913     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),kudu demographics;population;prey preference;selective predation;DIMORPHISM;HABITATS;ECOLOGY;SIZE;SEX;Prednisolone,,

This paper describes competition between modern humans and large carnivores in rural Uganda, including active, confrontational scavenging of carnivore kills by humans and carnivore attacks on humans. Information gathered from Ugandan Game Department archives (1923-1994) reveals that twentieth-century agropastoralists regularly tried to scavenge from leopard (Panthera pardus) and lion (Panthera lee) kills, and that these large carnivores have preyed on hundreds of humans in Uganda over the past several decades. Men were most often targets of carnivore attack, particularly while engaged in hunting-related activities. However attacks on men were less often lethal than attacks on women and children. Analyses show that lion attacks were more dangerous than leopard attacks.

We argue that prey can make better decisions than allowed by one model; the other model describes cases in which predators wait for prey to emerge. We present optimality models that permit prey to select a time to emerge that maximizes fitness. When in a refuge, a prey cannot obtain benefits outside; emerging too soon can be catastrophic, but delaying emergence entails loss of fitness. If predators resume foraging quickly rather than engaging in strategic waiting games, current theory suggests that prey emerge when the costs of remaining in a refuge and of emerging are equal. However, prey often can do better by emerging at the time maximizing fitness rather than when benefits equal costs (i.e. when prey break even). Optimal emergence time depends on initial fitness, benefits lost by remaining in refuge, and the decay rate of predation risk. Benefits lost if a prey is killed are modelled separately from benefits that contribute to lifetime fitness, even if the prey is killed (individual reproduction, altruism). Fitness of prey emerging at the optimal emergence time may be greater than, equal to or less than initial fitness. Break-even and optimality models base predictions on the opposing effects of risk and loss of benefits. Thus, many empirically verified predictions are identical at the ordinal level although differing quantitatively. Optimality models provide novel testable predictions for the effects of initial fitness, benefits, and, for ectotherms, the rate of cooling in refuge. They predict earlier emergence for equal retainable benefits than for those lost upon death.

The native noble crayfish (Astacus astacus) has a long coevolutionary history with eel in Finland and the introduced signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) a short one. We found that in the presence of odours from food deprived eels, noble crayfish increased shelter use and reduced nocturnal foraging activity. In contrast, signal crayfish reduced shelter use and increased their foraging activity when exposed to eel odours.

Although seemingly paradoxical, this type of approach behaviour has been noted in a wide variety of taxa. We adopt a cost - benefit perspective on the question of why prey approach potential predators, and aim to outline what is known about the putative costs and benefits of such behaviour. We identify five major types of costs associated with approach behaviour: (i) increased risk of mortality to the approacher, (ii) increased risk of mortality to relatives of the approacher, (iii) lost opportunity costs associated with approaching a predator, (iv) energetic costs of approach, and (v) potential costs of the approacher being 'exploited' by other group members. Benefits of approach behaviour are categorized as (i) acquiring information about the nature of the potential threat, (ii) informing others of the potential threat, (iii) deterring predator attack, and (iv) advertising one's quality to mates. After reviewing putative costs and benefits, we present a game theory model of prey approaching potential predators. Based on the costs and benefits of approach behaviour and group size, the model predicts the equilibrial frequency of 'approachers' and 'non-approachers' and the (relative) mean approach distance (as a function of group size). To date, much of the work on prey approaching predators is either anecdotal or non-experimental. We hope that the review of the costs and benefits of approaching predators presented here, in conjunction with our game theory model, will help provide direction for future studies of this interesting, but understudied, behavioural phenomenon.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  178     Total Times Cited:  182     Cited Reference Count:  117 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",,TIT PARUS-MAJOR;TAILED PRAIRIE DOGS;SNAKE-SPECIES DISCRIMINATION;CALIFORNIA GROUND-SQUIRRELS;GASTEROSTEUS-ACULEATUS L;GREAT TIT;ANTIPREDATOR BEHAVIOR;BROOD DEFENSE;3-SPINED STICKLEBACK;POECILIA-RETICULATA;Cost-Benefit Analysis;Prednisolone,,

We examined the trade-off between risk of predation and disease transmission under different scenarios of host spatial structure and disease avoidance behavior using a spatially explicit, individual-based model of the host pathogen interaction between juvenile Caribbean spiny lobster (Panulirus argus) and Panulirus argus Virus 1 (PaV1). Spiny lobsters are normally social but modify their behavior to avoid diseased conspecifics, a potentially effective means of reducing transmission but one rarely observed in the wild. We found that without lobster avoidance of diseased conspecifics, viral outbreaks grew in intensity and duration in simulations until the virus was maintained continuously at unrealistically high levels. However, when we invoked disease avoidance at empirically observed levels, the intensity and duration of outbreaks was reduced and the disease extirpated within five years. Increased lobster (host) spatial aggregation mimicking that which occurs when sponge shelters for lobsters are diminished by harmful algal blooms, did not significantly increase PaV1 transmission or persistence in lobster populations. On the contrary, behavioral aversion of diseased conspecifics effectively reduced viral prevalence, even when shelters were limited, which reduced shelter availability for all lobsters but increased predation, especially of infected lobsters. Therefore, avoidance of diseased conspecifics selects against transmission by contact, promotes alternative modes of transmission, and results in a more resilient host pathogen system.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  8     Total Times Cited:  8     Cited Reference Count:  69 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1890/13-0118.1     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),agent-based model;disease avoidance;disease transmission;harmful algal blooms;Panulirus argus Virus 1;sociality;VIRUS 1 PAV1;STINGING AGGRESSIVE RESPONSES;PANULIRUS-ARGUS;FLORIDA BAY;SPATIALLY-EXPLICIT;WORKER HONEYBEES;MATE PREFERENCES;FEMALE MICE;TRANSMISSION;RISK;Virus Diseases,,

Predation success is a function of the combined probabilities of encountering and capturing prey, which are influenced by both prey behavior and environmental features. While the relative importance of encounter and capture probabilities have been evaluated in a spatial framework, temporal variation in prey behavior and intrinsic catchability are likely to also affect the distribution of predation events. Using a single-predator-single-prey (puma-vicuna) system, we evaluated which factors predict predation events across both temporal and spatial dimensions of the components of predation by testing theprey-abundance hypothesis(predators select for high encounter probability) and theprey-catchability hypothesis(predators select for high relative capture probability) in time and space. We found that for both temporal and spatial analyses, neither the prey-abundance hypothesis nor the prey-catchability hypothesis alone predicted kill frequency or distribution; puma kill frequency was static throughout the diel cycle and pumas consistently selected a single habitat type when hunting, despite temporal and spatial variation in encounter rates and intrinsic catchability. Our integrated spatiotemporal analysis revealed that an interaction between time of day and habitat influences kill probability, suggesting that trade-offs in the temporal and spatial components of predation drive the probability of predation events. These findings reinforce the importance of examining both the temporal and spatial patterns of the components of predation, rather than unidimensional measures of predator or prey behavior, to comprehensively describe the feedbacks between predator and prey in the predator-prey game.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  9     Total Times Cited:  9     Cited Reference Count:  79 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1002/ecy.3172     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),ambush predator;encounter rate;habitat selection;hunting behavior;predation risk;prey vulnerability;Puma concolor;Vicugna vicugna;HABITAT USE;SPATIOTEMPORAL VARIATIONS;VERTICAL MIGRATION;DYNAMIC LANDSCAPE;TIME ALLOCATION;SEARCH RATE;PATCH USE;PREY;RISK;PATTERNS;Prednisolone,,

They observed that escape time was a roughly linear function of body mass whereas models have often assumed accelerating relations between fat reserves and predation risk. To translate escape time into predation risk, one needs to know the distribution of distances at which approaching predators are detected. This depends on the vigilance behaviour of the prey. Here I show that predation risk per attack will increase exponentially with time to reach protective cover for a commonly observed pattern of scanning by birds. Besides influencing fattening decisions, this rapidly increasing relation may also explain the observed reluctance of many foragers to venture more than a few metres from protective cover. The data presented by Metcalfe & Ure are perfectly compatible with recent theory and perhaps even more important than stated by the authors.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  48     Total Times Cited:  48     Cited Reference Count:  23 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1098/rspb.1996.0131     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),FAT RESERVES;SMALL BIRDS;SPARROW FLOCKS;WINTER;VIGILANCE;BEHAVIOR;STORAGE;ENERGY;TITS;Prednisolone,,

In comparison, female alternative tactics have attracted little attention, and further theoretical and empirical research are needed. Using a game theoretical model, we examine female choice alternatives (1) by considering assessment errors in a novel and more realistic manner than done previously, and (2) for the first time, by highlighting the formation of groups of females as an important consequence of copying behavior. We consider. two alternatives: direct assessment of male quality by females and female copying of the choice of other females. Assessment and copying are predicted to coexist under a wide variety of circumstances and copying is favored when females make assessment errors, when high-quality males are either common or very rare, and when female fitness declines with the number of other females choosing the same male. We also find that the frequency of copying at equilibrium is predicted to decrease when the presence of other females mating with the same male has a positive effect on female fitness (e.g. through increased male parental effort, decreased predation risk or cooperation among females). Female alternative choice tactics also influence the potential for sexual selection. In our model, when the frequency of copying females is low, the potential for sexual selection can be higher than in the absence of female copying. However, contrary to previous theory, we find that as copying females become more common than assessing females, the potential for sexual selection will be low as more females copy the mate choice of other copiers without assessment.

Parental behavior and predator ecology are two fundamental drivers of predation rates and patterns, but the role of parents is less certain, particularly for songbirds. Previous work reproduced microhabitat-predation patterns experienced by Yellow Warblers (Setophaga petechia) in the Mono Lake basin at experimental nests without parents, suggesting that these patterns were driven by predator ecology rather than predator interactions with parents. In this study, we further explored effects of post-initiation parental behavior (nest defense and attendance) on predation risk by comparing natural versus experimental patterns related to territory density, seasonal timing of nest initiation, and nest age. Rates of parasitism by Brown-headed Cowbirds (Molothrus ater) were high in this system (49% nests parasitized), so we also examined parasitism-predation relationships. Natural nest predation rates (NPR) correlated negatively with breeding territory density and nonlinearly (U-shaped relationship) with nest-initiation timing, but experimental nests recorded no such patterns. After adjusting natural-nest data to control for these differences from experimental nests other than the presence of parents (e. g., defining nest failure similarly and excluding nestling-period data), we obtained similar results. Thus, parents were necessary to produce observed patterns. Lower natural NPR compared with experimental NPR suggested that parents reduced predation rates via nest defense, so this parental behavior or its consequences were likely correlated with density or seasonal timing. In contrast, daily predation rates decreased with nest age for both nest types, indicating this pattern did not involve parents. Parasitized nests suffered higher rates of partial predation but lower rates of complete predation, suggesting direct predation by cowbirds. Explicit behavioral research on parents, predators (including cowbirds), and their interactions would further illuminate mechanisms underlying the density, seasonal, and nest age patterns we observed.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  4     Total Times Cited:  4     Cited Reference Count:  86 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1002/ece3.411     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Mono Lake;nest parasitism;nest predation;nest survival;parental behavior;population ecology;predator-prey interactions;Setophaga petechia;Yellow Warbler;BROOD PARASITISM;TURDUS-PILARIS;BEHAVIOR;HOST;SURVIVAL;DEFENSE;SELECTION;PATTERNS;SUCCESS;BIRDS;Prednisolone,,

A number of hypotheses predict sexual segregation but these are often contradictory with no agreement as to a common cause, perhaps because they are species specific. We explicitly tested three of these hypotheses which are commonly linked by a dependence on sexual dimorphism for animals which exhibit fine-scale sexual segregation; the Predation Risk Hypothesis, the Forage Selection Hypothesis, and the Activity Budget Hypothesis, in a single system the pheasant, Phasianus colchicus; a large, sedentary bird that is predominantly terrestrial and therefore analogous to ungulates rather than many avian species which sexually segregate. Over four years we reared 2,400 individually tagged pheasants from one day old and after a period of 8-10 weeks we released them into the wild. We then followed the birds for 7 months, during the period that they sexually segregate, determined their fate and collected behavioural and morphological measures pertinent to the hypotheses. Pheasants are sexually dimorphic during the entire period that they sexually segregate in the wild; males are larger than females in both body size and gut measurements. However, this did not influence predation risk and predation rates (as predicted by the Predation Risk Hypothesis), diet choice (as predicted by the Forage Selection Hypothesis), or the amount of time spent foraging, resting or walking (as predicted by the Activity Budget Hypothesis). We conclude that adult sexual size dimorphism is not responsible for sexual segregation in the pheasant in the wild. Instead, we consider that segregation may be mediated by other, perhaps social, factors. We highlight the importance of studies on a wide range of taxa to help further the knowledge of sexual segregation.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  5     Total Times Cited:  5     Cited Reference Count:  78 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.7717/peerj.5674     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Diet;Behavioural synchrony;Body size dimorphism;Group living;Gut morphology;Predation;NORTHERN GIANT PETRELS;PHASIANUS-COLCHICUS;SOCIAL SEGREGATION;BIGHORN SHEEP;MULE DEER;FORAGING EFFICIENCY;MONOMORPHIC SEABIRD;RELEASED PHEASANTS;MATING SYSTEMS;BODY-WEIGHT;Mental Competency,,

We examined the spatial response of foraging in endangered brush-tailed rock-wallabies to predation risk and food while taking into account the potentially competitive role of sympatric herbivores. We compared the occurrence (presence/absence) of rock-wallaby faecal pellets to the availability of edible vegetation, presence of sympatric macropods and predation risk factors such as distance from refuge and presence of shelter points. Rock-wallabies managed predation risk by foraging closer to their refuge and more often at shelter points. They foraged more where edible vegetation was higher, but only in the absence of predators and sympatric macropods, indicating that rock-wallaby foraging is restricted by their interactions with other species. The constraints on foraging behaviour demonstrated in this study can be used to guide management strategies aimed at conserving rock-wallaby populations.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  12     Total Times Cited:  13     Cited Reference Count:  72 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/j.1469-1795.2011.00446.x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),ecological interaction;fox;macropod;marsupial;rock-wallaby;Petrogale penicillata;TAILED ROCK-WALLABY;GIVING-UP DENSITIES;PATCH USE;APPARENT COMPETITION;WESTERN-AUSTRALIA;HABITAT;CONSERVATION;PREY;SELECTION;MACROPOD;Prednisolone,,

Some habitat features could provide both thermal and security cover, or both concealment and escape cover; but in other cases, habitat features such as vegetation could impose a tradeoff between opposing functions of cover. Cover that conceals an animal from a predator also could reduce the animal's visibility and thus, its ability to detect a predator early enough to escape capture. We quantified the opposing functional properties of cover (concealment and visibility) and evaluated the relationship between these properties using continuous measures in sagebrush-steppe and grassland habitats. We hypothesized that concealment and visibility would be inversely related and that the slope of this relationship would differ among sites with varying density and patchiness of shrub vegetation, imposing differing tradeoff scenarios. Concealment and visibility were inversely, but not perfectly related, implying that animals must make tradeoffs between the properties of cover, but they could achieve higher levels of one property while giving up relatively less of the other. In addition, we examined potential tradeoffs by pygmy rabbits (Brachylagus idahoensis) by comparing concealment and visibility at locations used by rabbits with measurements collected at random locations. At a small scale, pygmy rabbits traded off visibility for concealment in dense and sparse vegetation, but not in patchy vegetation. Although cover is an intuitively simple concept, it is functionally more complex, and this study provides insight into the opposing mechanisms of cover that might influence habitat use. Our work provides an initial step towards more fully understanding how cover functionally relates to predation risk.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  28     Total Times Cited:  28     Cited Reference Count:  47 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1890/ES12-00114.1     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Brachylagus idahoensis;predation risk;pygmy rabbit;tradeoffs;RABBITS BRACHYLAGUS-IDAHOENSIS;NEST-SITE SELECTION;PREDATION-RISK;TRADE-OFF;TIME ALLOCATION;PATCH USE;VIGILANCE;BEHAVIOR;INDICATOR;FORAGERS,,

It may not be so surprising that vertebrates, with large central nervous systems, excel at predatory behaviors. More striking is the fact that many tiny insects, with their miniscule brains and scaled down nerve cords, are also ferocious, highly successful predators. For predation, it is important to determine whether a prey is suitable before initiating pursuit. This is paramount since pursuing a prey that is too large to capture, subdue or dispatch will generate a substantial metabolic cost (in the form of muscle output) without any chance of metabolic gain (in the form of food). In addition, during all pursuits, the predator breaks its potential camouflage and thus runs the risk of becoming prey itself. Many insects use their eyes to initially detect and subsequently pursue prey. Dragonflies, which are extremely efficient predators, therefore have huge eyes with relatively high spatial resolution that allow efficient prey size estimation before initiating pursuit. However, much smaller insects, such as killer flies, also visualize and successfully pursue prey. This is an impressive behavior since the small size of the killer fly naturally limits the neural capacity and also the spatial resolution provided by the compound eye. Despite this, we here show that killer flies efficiently pursue natural (Drosophila melanogaster) and artificial (beads) prey. The natural pursuits are initiated at a distance of 7.9 +/- 2.9 cm, which we show is too far away to allow for distance estimation using binocular disparities. Moreover, we show that rather than estimating absolute prey size prior to launching the attack, as dragonflies do, killer flies attack with high probability when the ratio of the prey's subtended retinal velocity and retinal size is 0.37. We also show that killer flies will respond to a stimulus of an angular size that is smaller than that of the photoreceptor acceptance angle, and that the predatory response is strongly modulated by the metabolic state. Our data thus provide an exciting example of a loosely designed matched filter to Drosophila, but one which will still generate successful pursuits of other suitable prey.

Limiting habitat types can create spatial anchors for prey or predators, influencing the likelihood that the predator or prey response will dominate. Joint spatial anchors emerge when predator and prey occupy similar feeding habitat domains and risk and reward become spatially conflated, confusing predictions of which player will win the space race. These spatial dynamics of risk-foraging trade-offs are often obscured by habitat heterogeneity and community complexity in large vertebrate systems, fueling ambiguity regarding the generality of predictions from predator-prey theory. To test how habitat distribution influences the predator-prey space race, we examine correlation in puma and vicuna habitat selection and space use at two sites, one of which generates a distinct risk-foraging trade-off at a joint spatial anchor. The distribution of vegetation, which serves as both forage for vicunas and stalking cover for pumas, differs between the sites; the llano contains a single central meadow that acts as a joint spatial anchor, while the canyon is characterized by more heterogeneous vegetation. Puma-vicuna habitat selection correlation was positive in the llano and negative in the canyon, and similarly, utilization distributions were more strongly correlated in the llano than the canyon. Vicuna locations occurred at higher values of puma habitat selection and utilization in the llano than in the canyon. Similarly, puma locations in the llano occurred at higher values of vicuna habitat selection and utilization than in the canyon. Although pumas consistently selected for and utilized vegetative and topographic cover regardless of habitat distribution, vicunas only selected against vegetation in the heterogeneous canyon site, reducing spatial correlation with pumas. Our work suggests a joint spatial anchor favors pumas in the space race due to the inability for vicunas to avoid crucial foraging habitat. The outcome of the predator-prey space race appears to be strongly informed by the distribution of habitat, whereby corresponding predictability of predator and prey favors predators in the spatial game.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  20     Total Times Cited:  20     Cited Reference Count:  52 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1002/ecy.2724     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),antipredator behavior;habitat domain;habitat selection;predator-prey response race;Puma concolor;spatial anchor;utilization distribution;Vicugna vicugna;SPATIOTEMPORAL DYNAMICS;RESOURCE SELECTION;RISK;SCALE;LANDSCAPE;BEHAVIOR;ECOLOGY;SUCCESS;WOLVES;GAMES;Continental Population Groups;Prednisolone;Ecosystem,,

Lethal control, usually by hunting, is the most cost-effective method of reducing their number and impact. However, deer habitat use varies spatially and temporally, meaning that hunters (the predator) may search in habitats with few or no deer. Also, deer may modify their behaviour in response to hunting pressure in ways that decrease the risk of being killed, reducing the efficacy of lethal control programmes. To address these issues we decomposed the predation process into its four constituent stages-prey occurrence, predator search, predators encounter prey, predators kill prey they encounter-to reveal what makes female sika deer (Cervus nippon) in the North Island, New Zealand, more susceptible to control by professional helicopter-based hunters. Female sika deer were encountered more in some habitats or landscape features than in others, but the likelihood of kill given an encounter in those habitats was not always correspondingly high. Similarly, variables that positively influenced the probabilities of encounter and kill did not similarly influence deer occurrence, and variables most likely to be searched often poorly correlated with the other predation stages. These disparities contributed to suboptimal searching for and killing of deer by helicopter-based hunters during winter and spring, but not summer. Our study demonstrates how decomposing predation risk can identify risk and refuge areas for target species, and can be used to alter tactics as target species adjust to changing predation risk. This analytical approach is highly applicable to other human hunter-prey systems.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  5     Total Times Cited:  5     Cited Reference Count:  63 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s10530-017-1531-0     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Cervus nippon;Kaweka Forest Park;Probability of encounter;Probability of kill;Resource selection;Sika deer;WHITE-TAILED DEER;RESOURCE SELECTION;ECOLOGICAL IMPACTS;SIKA-DEER;RED DEER;BIG-GAME;MANAGEMENT;HABITAT;EXPENDITURE;PATTERNS;Prednisolone;New Zealand,,

Since meso-predators themselves are also prospective prey, they too need to trade-off between food and safety. We applied foraging theory to study patch use and habitat selection by a meso-predator, the red fox. We present evidence that foxes use a quitting harvest rate rule when deciding whether or not to abandon a foraging patch, and experience diminishing returns when foraging from a depletable food patch. Furthermore, our data suggest that patch use decisions of red foxes are influenced not just by the availability of food, but also by their perceived risk of predation. Fox behavior was affected by moonlight, with foxes depleting food resources more thoroughly (lower giving-up density) on darker nights compared to moonlit nights. Foxes reduced risk from hyenas by being more active where and when hyena activity was low. While hyenas were least active during moon, and most active during full moon nights, the reverse was true for foxes. Foxes showed twice as much activity during new moon compared to full moon nights, suggesting different costs of predation. Interestingly, resources in patches with cues of another predator (scat of wolf) were depleted to significantly lower levels compared to patches without. Our results emphasize the need for considering risk of predation for intermediate predators, and also shows how patch use theory and experimental food patches can be used for a predator. Taken together, these results may help us better understand trophic interactions.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  49     Total Times Cited:  49     Cited Reference Count:  37 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s00442-008-1243-3     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Giving-up densities;Intraguild predation;Optimal foraging;Predation risk;Vulpes vulpes;HABITAT SELECTION GAMES;INTRAGUILD PREDATION;INTERFERENCE COMPETITION;TROPHIC INTERACTIONS;FORAGING GAMES;PREY;APPREHENSION;CARNIVORA;DYNAMICS;COYOTES;Prednisolone,,

Understanding the underlying ecological drivers of livestock depredation by large carnivores is greatly needed.        2. We studied the spatial, foraging and behavioural ecology of African lions Panthera leo in the Botswana Makgadikgadi ecosystem. This ecosystem comprises a protected area, characterized by high seasonal fluctuation in wild prey abundance, and adjacent lands, which are used for livestock grazing and characterized by stable livestock abundance, but also a risk of anthropogenic mortality.        3. Makgadikgadi lions preferentially preyed upon migratory wild herbivores when they were present; however, data from GPS (Global Positioning System) radiocollared lions revealed that the majority of the study lions did not follow the migratory herds but remained resident at one or other border of the park and switched to livestock (abundant and readily available), and to a lesser extent resident wild herbivores (relatively scarce), in periods of migratory wild herbivore scarcity.        4. Resident lions' use of space differed between periods of wild prey abundance and scarcity. These changes were likely to increase the frequency of encounter with their primary prey in periods of primary prey abundance and with livestock in periods of primary prey scarcity.        5. The risk of conflict with humans was a major driver of lion ecology in the human-dominated landscape surrounding the protected area. Resident lions generally avoided the close vicinity of cattle-posts.

An individual's fitness depends on its strategy choice or ecotype (predators decide which prey species to pursue and prey decide what proportion of their time to spend in the refuge) as well as on the population sizes of all three species. It is shown that, when there is a single prey species with a refuge or two prey species with no refuge compete only indirectly (i.e. there is only apparent competition between prey species), that stable resident systems where all individuals in each species have the same ecotype cannot be destabilized by the introduction of mutant ecotypes that are initially selectively neutral. In game-theoretic terms, this means that stable monomorphic resident systems, with ecotypes given by a Nash equilibrium, are both ecologically and evolutionarily stable. However, we show that this is no longer the case when the two indirectly-competing prey species have a refuge. This illustrates theoretically that two ecological factors, that are separately stabilizing (apparent competition and refuge use), may have a combined destabilizing effect from the evolutionary perspective. These results generalize the concept of an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) to models in evolutionary ecology. Several biological examples of predator-prey systems are discussed from this perspective. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Studies that assess trade-offs between migratory strategies typically compare the amount of predation risk and forage resources migrants and residents are exposed to only while on separate ranges and assume both groups intermix completely while on sympatric ranges. Here we provide one of the first tests of this assumption by comparing the amount of overlap between home ranges of GPS-collared migrant and resident elk and fine-scale exposure to wolf predation risk and forage biomass at telemetry locations on a sympatric winter range in west-central Alberta, Canada. Overlap between migrant and resident home ranges increased throughout the winter, and both groups were generally intermixed and exposed to equal forage biomass. During the day, both migrants and residents avoided predation risk by remaining in areas far from timber with high human activity, which wolves avoided. However, at night wolves moved onto the grasslands close to humans and away from timber. Resident elk were consistently closer to areas of human activity and further from timber than migrants, possibly because of a habituation to humans. As a result, resident elk were exposed to higher night-time predation risk than migrants. Our study does not support the assumption that migrant and resident elk are exposed to equal predation risk on their sympatric range when human presence alters predation risk dynamics and habituation to humans is unequal between migratory strategies.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  26     Total Times Cited:  27     Cited Reference Count:  62 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s00442-010-1620-6     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Habituation;Home-range overlap;Partial migration;Ungulates;Wolf predation;RESOURCE SELECTION;BIALOWIEZA FOREST;PARTIAL MIGRATION;TROPHIC CASCADE;GROUP-SIZE;PREY;WOLVES;RED;EVOLUTION;BEHAVIOR;Prednisolone,,

As a test, we exposed gerbils to risk of predation from various predators, including snakes, owls, and foxes. The snakes included the Saharan horned viper (Cerastes cerastes) and the sidewinder rattlesnake (Crotalus cerastes). The former snake lacks sensory pits and shares a common evolutionary history with the gerbil. The latter snake, while convergent evolutionarily on the horned viper, has sensory pits and no prior history with the gerbil. The gerbils exploited depletable resource patches similarly, regardless of snake species and moon phase. While the gerbils did not respond to the novel snake as a greater threat than their familiar horned viper, the gerbils were cognizant that the novel predator was a threat. In response to both snakes, giving-up densities (GUDs; the amount of food left in a resource patch following exploitation) of the gerbils were higher in the bush than open microhabitat. In response to moonlight, GUDs were higher on full than on the new moon. Based on GUDs, the gerbils responded most to the risk of predation from the red fox, least from the two snake species, and intermediate for the barn owl.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  17     Total Times Cited:  17     Cited Reference Count:  30 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1080/15659801.2016.1176614     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),biological invasions;common-garden experiments;constraint-breaking adaptations;prey naivete;predator-prey foraging games;vipers;FORAGING BEHAVIOR;KANGAROO RATS;PREY NAIVETE;RISK;FACILITATION;COMPETITION;INVASIONS;DIVERSITY;OWLS;GAME;Gerbillinae;Prednisolone,,

However, how the predator's food requirement and the prey's necessity to avoid predation interact with their respective thermoregulatory strategies remains poorly understood. The recently developed 'thermal game model' predicts that in the face of imminent predation, prey should divide their time equally among a range of thermal patches. In contrast, predators should concentrate their hunting activities towards warmer patches. In this study, we test these predictions in a laboratory setup and an artificial environment that mimics more natural conditions. In both cases, we scored thermal patch use of newt larvae (prey) and free-ranging dragonfly nymphs (predators). Similar effects were seen in both settings. The newt larvae spent less time in the warm patch if dragonfly nymphs were present. The patch use of the dragonfly nymphs did not change as a function of prey availability, even when the nymphs were starved prior to the experiment. Our behavioral observations partially corroborate predictions of the thermal game model. In line with asymmetric fitness pay-offs in predator-prey interactions (the 'life-dinner' principle), the prey's thermal strategy is more sensitive to the presence of predators than vice versa.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  7     Total Times Cited:  7     Cited Reference Count:  48 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1371/journal.pone.0065079     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),MARGINAL VALUE THEOREM;COST-BENEFIT MODEL;HABITAT SELECTION;LIZARD THERMOREGULATION;VERTICAL MIGRATION;TEMPERATURE;PLASTICITY;RISK;BEHAVIOR;GAMES;Prednisolone,,

Control methods can be non-selective and, consequently, can potentially have a negative impact on non-target predator species, affecting carnivore guild. In order to assess the potential risks associated with non-selective predator control in the presence of intraguild competition, the classical Lotka-Volterra competition model was used, but with two additional factors: a linear factor for capture mortality (mortality caused by predator control) and a factor for vacated niche occupancy associated with immigration. Simulation in a scenario with three species revealed that one of them, the red fox , which presented the highest intrinsic growth rate, can show population increases even under moderate control, whereas the population of European badger , with a lower intrinsic growth rate, was reduced and, in some cases, may even become extinct. Lastly, the stone marten presented a differential response, depending on the removal intensity and strategy employed. This behaviour is compatible with the results observed in a Mediterranean environment subjected to two types of game management: non-selective predator control (culling) and no control. In areas with non-selective control and moderate predator removal, the red fox population remained stable, while the stone marten and the European badger populations reduced markedly or disappeared.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  11     Total Times Cited:  11     Cited Reference Count:  62 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s11284-012-0931-y     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Competitor release effect;Martes foina;Meles meles;Predator control;Vulpes vulpes;MESOPREDATOR RELEASE;POPULATION-DENSITY;GAME MANAGEMENT;RED FOX;CONSERVATION;LANDSCAPE;ABUNDANCE;PATTERNS;EXAMPLE;Prednisolone,,

However, it remains unclear what factors promote the evolution of qualitatively different defense strategies and when evolution should favor strategies that involve modification of multiple traits. Previous theory suggests that individual-level trade-offs play a key role in defense evolution, but most of this work has assumed that trade-offs are independent. Here we show that the shape of the behavioral trade-off between foraging gain and predation risk determines the interaction between this trade-off and the life-history trade-off between growth and reproduction. The interaction between these fundamental trade-offs determines the optimal investment into behavioral and life-history defenses. Highly nonlinear foraging-predation risk trade-offs favor the evolution of behavioral defenses, while linear trade-offs favor life-history defenses. Between these extremes, integrated defense responses are optimal, with defense expression strongly depending on ontogeny. We suggest that these predictions may be general across qualitatively different defenses. Our results have important implications for theory on the ecological effects of inducible defense, which has not considered how qualitatively different defenses might alter ecological interactions.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  38     Total Times Cited:  38     Cited Reference Count:  64 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Included""}",10.1086/655425     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),phenotypic plasticity;inducible defense;foraging-predation risk trade-off;predator-prey;evolutionary computation;RESOURCE-ALLOCATION;ECOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES;TRAIT COMPENSATION;FOOD AVAILABILITY;PREY SELECTION;SIZE;DAPHNIA;POPULATIONS;LARVAE;RISK;Prednisolone,,

These models can be adjusted to provide very good fits to movement pattern data. Nonetheless, it seems that these models typically cannot explain how the observed movement patterns come about. This is because of a widely held but unverified theoretical principle; namely that correlated random walks cannot be optimized for typical foraging scenarios and so cannot represent archetypal, innate, evolved optimal behaviours. As a consequence a mechanistic framework to explain correlated random walk behaviour and to generate novel hypotheses about its evolution has not been formulated. This is a significant shortcoming because the key to prediction and understanding lies in the elucidation of mechanisms underlying the observed patterns. Here with the aid of a simple analytically tractable model it is shown how particular correlated random walk behaviours can, in fact, confer benefits to foragers that are acting under predation. Predation risks are ubiquitous. The mathematical analysis and the accompanying numerical simulations are the first to show that by varying their correlated random walks behaviour animals can control both their rate of energetic gain and the probability of encountering a predator, and can thereby optimize their expected total energy intake. This mechanism can provide selection pressures for particular habitat-specific correlated random walk behaviours and thereby shows that correlated random walks can have explanatory as well as descriptive capability.

Various movement strategies have been proposed by which individuals might aggregate to form a selfish herd as a defence against predation, but although the spatial benefits of these strategies have been extensively studied, little attention has been paid to the importance of predator attacks that occur while the aggregation is forming. We investigate the success of mutant aggregation strategies invading populations of individuals using alternative strategies and find that the invasion dynamics depend critically on the time scale of movement. If predation occurs early in the movement sequence, simpler strategies are likely to prevail. If predators attack later, more complex strategies invade. If there is variation in the timing of predator attacks (through variation within or between individual predators), we hypothesize that groups will consist of a mixture of strategies, dependent upon the distribution of predator attack times. Thus, behavioural diversity can evolve and be maintained in populations of animals experiencing a diverse range of predators differing solely in their attack behaviour. This has implications for our understanding of predator-prey dynamics, as the timing of predator attacks will exert selection pressure on prey behavioural responses, to which predators must respond.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  20     Total Times Cited:  20     Cited Reference Count:  36 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1098/rspb.2010.1605     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),selfish herd;aggregation;anti-predator behaviour;group living;ANTIPREDATOR BEHAVIOR;AVOIDANCE;MOVEMENT;DILUTION;MODEL;EMERGENCE;GEOMETRY;ANIMALS;DANGER;ATTACK;Prednisolone,,

The selective effects of bird predation in relation to foraging behaviour in canopy-living spiders were studied in a 2-year field experiment using exclosures in a spruce forest in southern Sweden. Three different hunting strategies - free-hunting, two-dimensional web, three-dimensional web - were included in the analysis. Comparisons of bird predation rate (ratio ln (abundance net-enclosed branch/abundance control)) showed considerable variation between spider groups. Free-hunting spiders suffered most from avian insectivores and predation rate was significantly higher than in spiders with two-dimensional webs. Spiders with three-dimensional webs were exposed to a predation rate in between those of the two other hunting strategies. Generally, the experimental effect was significantly higher in spring samples than in autumn, suggesting a stronger predation pressure in winter. The high variation in susceptibility to predation by insectivores implies that selection on behaviour of spider individuals is strong. Web building in itself is probably part of the protective mechanism, suggesting that webs have dual functions. We conclude that the risk of bird predation is a selective force on foraging behaviour of spiders in a forest canopy system.(c) 2015 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2015, 115, 58-68.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  14     Total Times Cited:  15     Cited Reference Count:  60 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/bij.12489     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Araneae;avian insectivores;differential mortality;hunting strategy;spider webs;spruce canopies;ANTIPREDATOR BEHAVIOR;INSECTIVOROUS BIRDS;CANOPY ARTHROPODS;LIVING ARTHROPODS;SILK DECORATIONS;SIZE;MORTALITY;SELECTION;RICHNESS;SUCCESS;Prednisolone,,

Such interactions have been explored intensely in terrestrial predatorprey systems where both nocturnal prey and predators adjust their activity and foraging behaviour to levels of moonlight. In the case of prey, higher levels of moonlight increase predation risks, and thus prey display lower levels of activity and/or shifts in their use of microhabitat during full moon nights. Predators also display parallel modifications of their activity rhythms during full moon nights but why? Are predators also sensitive to increased predation, or do predators adjust their behaviour to that of their prey in order to optimize foraging success? Herein, we examined nocturnal predatory behaviour in a natural system where insular cottonmouth snakes, Agkistrodon piscivorus conanti, forage for fish carrion that is indifferent to levels of moonlight, thereby removing complexities linked to the behavioural patterns of prey. Our results demonstrated that insular cottonmouths increase their activity during full moon nights. Predation pressure on snakes foraging in the open does not seem to drive their nocturnal behaviour insofar as small-sized individuals presumably more susceptible to predation are equally abundant as adult snakes irrespective of levels of moonlight. These results suggest that variation in predator's activity in natural predatorprey systems during risky (full moon) nights might be attributable principally to the availability and detectability of prey rather than a foraging-safety trade-off specific to the predator.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  28     Total Times Cited:  29     Cited Reference Count:  42 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/j.1469-7998.2011.00866.x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),cottonmouth;snake;foraging;scavenging;carrion;moonlight;risk;trade-off;PREDATION RISK;FORAGING BEHAVIOR;RATES;RODENTS;PREY;GAME;MORTALITY;ECOLOGY;OWLS;FEAR,,

This paradoxical result is consistent with increasing trends in malpractice claims in spite of safety improvements, observed for example in empirical studies on anesthesiologists.

Once a territory has been acquired, an animal may spend its entire life on it, and may have to repeatedly defend it from conspecifics. Some species make great investments in the defence of a territory, and this defence can be costly, in terms of time, energy and risk of injury. Time costs in particular have rarely been explicitly factored into such models. In this paper we consider a model of territorial defence which includes both population dynamic and time delay elements, building upon recent advances in time constraint models. Populations may divide into two distinct types, where one type makes no effort to control territories. We shall call this type nomads, and the other type territorials. Here the territory owners must divide their time between patrolling and foraging, and this balance is their only strategic decision. We show how to find the evolutionarily stable patrolling strategy and the population composition of territorials and nomads, and consider some examples demonstrating key situations. We see that both time constraints and population density pressure are crucial to influencing behaviour. In particular we find cases with both territorial individuals and nomads where a mixed, either pure or both pure patrolling strategies are evolutionarily stable. In different conditions either nomads or territorials can be absent, and indeed for a significant range of parameter combinations the population can exhibit tristability, with three distinct ecologically stable population compositions: with both nomads and territorials, only nomads or only territorials.

Fiddler crabs, Uca lactea perplexa, respond to potential predators by retreating into their burrows. Time inside the burrow during unprovoked retreats during normal activity provides a 'null model' to test whether sex, tidal cycle and body size affect hiding time from potential predators. Using experimentally created predator-like stimuli we found that males hid for significantly longer than females, and larger crabs of both sexes also hid for longer. This differs from burrow use during unprovoked retreats, suggesting hiding time varies depending on the potential risk of predation on re-emergence. If risk prior to hiding predicts risk on emergence, the closer the proximity of a predator-like stimulus when first encountered the longer crabs should hide. We confirmed this experimentally (stimuli at 0.5 versus 2.5 m). Finally, we tested whether males hide for longer when a predator-like stimulus approaches them directly rather than tangentially. None of three pairwise comparisons was statistically significant, but crabs hid less as the angle of approach became more tangential. These results suggest prey can use stimuli prior to hiding to predict predation risk on re-emergence, but studies on predators are required to test this claim. Finally, theoretical models must explain why hiding time has a lognormal distribution and low variance such that a predator can predict when most prey will re-emerge. For example, 95% of crabs re-emerged within 2.3 min of hiding.

Several hypotheses have been put forward to explain the evolution and occurrence of CNP, but no generally applicable hypothesis exists. Recent experimental results from the common goldeneye (Bucephala clangula), a cavity-nesting duck, have revealed that parasitic females preferentially lay eggs in safe nest-sites, implying that nest predation risk is an important ecological determinant of CNP. The present study focuses on the mechanisms by which parasites identify safe nest-sites. Predation risk of a given nest-site was predictable between successive breeding seasons. At the end of the nesting season, females prospected active nest-sites more frequently than nest-sites that did not have a nest in the current season. Nest-sites that had been prospected more frequently by females in year t had a higher probability to be parasitized in year t + 1. The results suggest that the use of public information, derived through nest-site prospecting, enabled parasites to target safe nests.

We investigate the pattern formation and compute the average size of the single-species spatial domains emerging from the grouping behaviour. The results reveal that the defence tactic reduces the predation risk significantly, being more profitable if individuals perceive further distances, thus creating bigger groups. Our outcomes show that the species with more conditioned organisms dominate the cyclic spatial game, controlling most of the territory. On the other hand, the species with fewer individuals ready to perform aggregation strategy gives its predator the chance to fill the more significant fraction of the grid.

Striped skunks, Mephitis mephitis, spray noxious secretions at predators and advertise this danger with deterrent behaviours and black-and-white aposematic coloration. Evidence suggests skunks are effective at deterring terrestrial mammalian predators but are vulnerable to aerial predators; how skunks assess the risk posed by different predator types, however, has not been examined empirically. We recorded the behavioural responses of skunks to audio playbacks of coyotes, Canis latrans, and great horned owls, Bubo virginianus (the primary terrestrial and aerial predators of skunks, respectively), and peregrine falcons, Falco peregrinus, and white noise as controls. Skunks ran away more often from vocalizations of their main predators, great horned owls and coyotes, than from diurnal falcon vocalizations or white noise recordings. Skunks also tended to run away sooner in response to owl vocalizations than falcon or coyote vocalizations. Finally, subjects tended to engage in vigilance more frequently in response to owl vocalizations than in response to coyote vocalizations, which together with other results suggest that skunks may perceive owls as more threatening relative to coyotes. This study elucidates how a well-defended mammal can determine which perceived threat is the riskiest and alter its behaviour when its main defence strategy may not be successful against all predator types.

Two tactics (tending and blocking) feature defense and cooperative mating over a relatively prolonged consort period (up to 3 days). In the coursing tactic, subordinate rams fight dominants for temporary copulatory access (lasting seconds) to defended ewes. By combining population-wide genetic (microsatellite) exclusion of paternity, behavioral data and a model of bighorn reproductive competition, we estimated that coursing rams fathered 44% of 142 lambs assigned paternity in two natural populations. In one population, the probability of successful defense against coursing was lowest among rams that had many female consorts and held highest dominance rank. Even so, per capita annual male reproductive success was positively associated with social rank in both herds when measured in terms of fall conceptions. The proportion of coursing versus defending ram matings in each population (0.36 and 0.39) was similar to the corresponding fraction of lambs (0.43 and 0.47) fathered by coursing rams, suggesting that sperm competition approximated a fair lottery. Male traits important in gaining social status and obtaining cooperative consorts with ewes were different and potentially in conflict with those needed to defend against (and practise) coursing. Although the concussive weapons (horns) of rams are less dangerous than, for example, the piercing weapons of other bovids, injury from falls and horn blows during coursing brawls may cause death, handicap future mating competition or increase the risk of predation. Coursing is a rare example of an unconventional alternative mating tactic that is high-gain and high-risk.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  142     Total Times Cited:  143     Cited Reference Count:  52 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s002650050361     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),mating tactics;DNA microsatellites;paternity;bighorn sheep;SPERM COMPETITION GAMES;EXTRA-PAIR COPULATIONS;SEXUAL SELECTION;SUCCESS;PATERNITY;MARKERS;CHOICE;POPULATIONS;MECHANISMS;PARENTAGE;Sheep,,

The foraging costs considered are energy expenditure, predation risk, and other mortality factors. It is shown that increasing the magnitude of one cost often decreases the relative and absolute sensitivity of the optimal foraging strategy to that cost. The relative fitness effects of different costs generally differ from the relative sensitivities of the optimal strategies to the cost factors. Researchers should therefore measure the shapes of cost curves rather than their average magnitudes to determine which of several costs can be ignored in cost-benefit analyses.

We assessed multiple hypotheses regarding the relationship between maternal effort, paternal effort, and the sexually selected trait of male song complexity in the song sparrow Melospiza melodia. Further, we explored whether experimentally elevating perceived adult-directed predation risk near nests affected these relationships. We quantified two dimensions of song complexity: song repertoire size and residual syllable number (the relative number of syllables for a given song repertoire size). Under elevated perceived predation risk, but not in the absence of the predator stimuli, females mated to males with higher residual syllable number displayed higher nestling provisioning rates and performed a greater proportion of nestling provisioning trips. In other words, elevating perceived predation risk induced a pattern of maternal investment consistent with differential allocation. In contrast, under elevated perceived predation risk, only, females performed a lesser proportion of provisioning trips when mated to males with large song repertoire sizes. Further, consistent with the good parent hypothesis, males with large song repertoire sizes displayed lower latencies to return to the nest, independent of the predator stimuli. Results suggest that residual syllable number may reflect some aspect of male genetic quality, such that females are more willing to maintain maternal effort while facing heightened predation risk. On the other hand, females may gain paternal benefits when mated to males with large song repertoires. Our study supports the hypothesis that increased costs of parental care associated with predation risk may induce relationships between sexually selected traits and parental behavior, which may increase the strength of sexual selection. Additionally, results suggest that different aspects of song complexity may fulfill non-equivalent signaling roles.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  2     Total Times Cited:  2     Cited Reference Count:  63 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/jav.00758     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),REPERTOIRE SIZE;DIFFERENTIAL-ALLOCATION;PLUMAGE COLORATION;SEXUAL SELECTION;NEST DEFENSE;REPRODUCTIVE COMPENSATION;OFFSPRING SEX;CARE;INVESTMENT;QUALITY;Prednisolone;Music,,

In many species, an important component of an individual's environment is its social environment - the mix of individuals in its social group. Accordingly, much of game theory assumes that the mix of behavioral types (BTs) in a social group influences individual fitness and group dynamics. Few experimental studies, however, have directly investigated how the group's mix of BTs influences individual and group outcomes. Here we manipulated social group composition in the water strider Aquarius remigis and evaluated the effects of our manipulation on individual behavior and various group outcomes (overall group activity, aggression, mating success). We formed 12 groups that differed substantially in average male BT (activity and aggression level), each with a low variance in BT. That is, one group had only the most active and aggressive males, a second group was made up of the next most active and aggressive males, and on down to a group of all very inactive and unaggressive males. All groups also had females. We found that, on average, groups made up of more active-aggressive males continued to be more active than other groups, but that contrary to predictions, these groups did not tend to enjoy higher mating success. Instead, a major factor affecting group mating activity was the presence of hyper-aggressive males. Hyper-aggressive males drove females out of the group and thereby decreased the group's overall mating activity. We discuss these findings in terms of their importance to the study of behavioral plasticity in social groups and the potential role of keystone individuals in determining group dynamics.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  216     Total Times Cited:  218     Cited Reference Count:  40 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1163/156853905774539454     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),behavioral syndromes;game theory;aggressive behavior;mating behavior;mating success;male-female conflict;keystone individuals;AQUARIUS-REMIGIS HETEROPTERA;DARK-EYED JUNCOS;PREDATION RISK;FITNESS CONSEQUENCES;MATING-BEHAVIOR;SEXUAL CONFLICT;FEMALE DENSITY;DOMINANCE;SELECTION;WATERSTRIDER,,

The variation in density reflects a similar variety of processes ranging from density-dependent habitat selection at small scales to independently regulated populations at much larger ones. I measured each scale with experiments capitalizing on the behavior of individual deer mice foraging in badland habitats in Alberta, Canada. First, I used patterns in rodent density along transects crossing badland and prairie habitats to measure the scale of habitat selection. Consistent with theoretical predictions, differences in the intercepts of isodars (graphs of density in adjacent habitats assuming ideal habitat selection) comparing prairie and badland densities revealed a maximum scale of habitat selection on the order of only 140 m. Second, I used foraging experiments to estimate density-dependent declines in fitness measured by the surrogate of giving-up-density of mice foraging in artificial foraging patches. Habitat selection should tend to equalize giving-up-densities among replicated, but spatially segregated, grids containing different numbers of foragers. Contrary to predictions from habitat selection theory, giving-up-densities declined with increased forager density in the majority of grids. Giving-up densities in nine of 12 grids increased linearly as population density was reduced in 1997. Giving-up densities in eight of 10 grids increased linearly with resource supplements in 1998. The results of both experiments are consistent with independent resource harvest by varying numbers of foraging mice. The identity of ""outlier"" grids, that showed little response to either manipulation, varied between years. The combined results document spatially-structured populations and allow us to estimate the frequency of stochastic dynamics that may have a profound influence on evolution and conservation strategies in heterogeneous landscapes.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  15     Total Times Cited:  16     Cited Reference Count:  61 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",,DEPENDENT HABITAT SELECTION;PATCH USE;FORAGING BEHAVIOR;PREDATION RISK;COEXISTENCE;DYNAMICS;GERBILS;SCALE;PERSPECTIVE;COMPETITION;Animals;Animal Shells,,

Each pond contained two distinct microhabitats for the fish: 1. A safe microhabitat: a sheltered area under an opaque cover at the center of the pool providing a refuge but no food. 2. A risky microhabitat: the rest of the pool area, where the fish could feed but were exposed to predation by egrets. This experimental design forced the goldfish to trade off food and safety, and to manage risk via time allocation to each microhabitat. The foraging behavioral responses of the gold variant and the bronze variant goldfish, one morph at a time, were quantified. In the presence of an egret, bronze morph fish spent significantly more time out of cover and more fish emerged from under the cover at any given time than did the gold morph fish. Despite the greater exposure of bronze morph fish, they were captured significantly less often by the egrets. These findings strongly suggest that differently colored fish may perceive predation risk differently, trade off food and safety differently, and may have different susceptibility to predators.

Foragers mitigating both types of risk should exhibit a bimodal distribution (increased foraging and mass gain early and late in the day), whereas both foraging and mass gains early (versus late) during the day are expected when the risk of starvation (versus predation) is greatest. Finally, relatively constant rates of foraging and mass gain should occur when the starvation-predation risk trade-off is independent of body mass. Using automated feeders with integrated digital balances, we estimated diurnal patterns in foraging and body mass gain to test which ecological scenario was best supported in wintering great tits Parus major. Based on data of 40 consecutive winter days recording over 12 000 body masses of 28 individuals, we concluded that birds foraged and gained mass early during the day, as predicted by theory when the starvation-predation risk trade-off is mass-dependent and starvation risk outweighs predation risk. Slower explorers visited the feeders more often, and decreased their activity along the day more strongly, compared with faster explorers, thereby explaining a major portion of the individual differences in diurnal patterning of foraging activity detected using random regression analyses. Birds did not differ in body mass gain trajectories, implying both that individuals differed in the usage of feeders, and that unbiased conclusions regarding how birds resolve starvation-predation risk trade-off require the simultaneous recording of foraging activity and body mass gain trajectories. Our study thereby provides the first unambiguous demonstration that individual birds are capable of adjusting their diurnal foraging and mass gain trajectories in response to ecological predictors of starvation risk as predicted by starvation-predation risk trade-off theory.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  21     Total Times Cited:  21     Cited Reference Count:  45 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1098/rspb.2017.2868     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),feeding behaviour;mass trajectories;optimization;risk-spreading theorem;starvation-predation risk trade-off;PERCEIVED PREDATION RISK;BLACKBIRDS TURDUS-MERULA;BODY-MASS;PARUS-MAJOR;FAT RESERVES;TRADE-OFF;DEPENDENT PREDATION;ENERGY RESERVES;EUROPEAN ROBINS;FEEDING DAY,,

Animals frequently adjust their response to predators in proportion to risk; however, when they are exposed to chronic predation risk, some animals reduce their antipredator responses in favour of resource acquisition. Animals that are subjected to predation pressure from multiple predator species may have to respond to different spatial and temporal distributions of risk; how they balance these risks will affect their choice of habitat or microhabitat patches. One species that is exposed to a wide range of predators is the pygmy salamander, Desmognathus wrighti. These miniaturized terrestrial plethodontids spend their entire life on the forest floor where they are exposed to a diversity of predators. We examined pygmy salamanders' ability to avoid potential predators based on the presence of substrateborne chemical cues. The predator species included ground beetles (Carabidae: Pterostichus), Jordan's salamanders, Plethodon jordani, and ring-necked snakes, Diadophis punctatus. The ring-necked snake is a trophic specialist feeding on salamanders while the beetles and Jordan's salamanders are generalist predators. The pygmy salamanders were also exposed to chemical alarm cues from a congeneric salamander (Desmognathus fuscus) and odours from two unfamiliar species: corn snakes (Pantherophis gutattus) and herbivorous desert tortoises (Gopherus agassizii). We used a hierarchical Bayesian beta regression with a repeated measures design to model proportion of time spent in each treatment. Compared to controls, pygmy salamanders exhibited strong aversion to fed ring-necked snakes, a moderate avoidance of unfamiliar odours and a slight attraction to scents from the two common generalist predators. Our results suggest that pygmy salamanders accept modest risk from common generalist predators but avoid less common, specialist predators and unfamiliar species.

We study the antipredator prey response in spatial tritrophic systems with cyclic species dominance using the rock-paper-scissors game. The impact of the antipredator behavior is local, with the predation probability reducing exponentially with the number of prey in the predator's neighborhood. In contrast to the standard Lotka-Volterra implementation of the rock-paper-scissors model, where no spiral waves appear, our outcomes show that the antipredator behavior leads to spiral patterns from random initial conditions. The results show that the predation risk decreases exponentially with the level of antipredator strength. Finally, we investigate the coexistence probability and verify that antipredator behavior may jeopardize biodiversity for high mobility.

Classic theory suggests that predators should focus their efforts on areas of abundant prey, that is, prey hotspots, whereas game-theoretical models of predator and prey movement suggest that the distribution of predators should match that of their prey's resources. If, however, prey are spatially anchored to one location and these prey have particularly strong antipredator responses that make them difficult to capture with frequent attacks, then predators may be forced to adopt alternative movement strategies to hunt behaviorally responsive prey. We examined the movement patterns of bird-eating sharp-shinned hawks ( Accipiter striatus) in an attempt to shed light on hotspot use by predators. Our results suggest that these hawks do not focus on prey hotspots such as bird feeders but instead maintain much spatial and temporal unpredictability in their movements. Hawks seldom revisited the same area, and the few frequently used areas were revisited in a manner consistent with unpredictable returns, giving prey little additional information about risk.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  43     Total Times Cited:  46     Cited Reference Count:  53 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1086/510605     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Accipiter;hotspot use;movement;predator;prey interactions;predictability;use of space;HABITAT SELECTION;HUNTING BEHAVIOR;WINTERING BIRDS;GROUP-SIZE;MOVEMENT;HAWKS;GAME;SPARROWHAWKS;VIGILANCE;PATTERNS;Prednisolone,,

We use this model to explore potential dynamics of mimicry systems where a bad outcome results in death. This leads to some counterintuitive expectations not found in earlier models of aggressive mimicry that have not included the potential for dupe death.        Abstract Aggressive mimicry is a widespread phenomenon in which predators use resemblance to objects in the environment to exploit organisms that make discrimination errors (dupes). Aggressive mimics harm dupes in several ways, including predation, parasitism (including brood parasitism), and infection. Previous models of aggressive mimicry have been built from models originally derived for protective mimicries where the risk of death to dupes was not considered. Some kinds of aggressive mimicry carry significant risk of death for the dupes. Death changes things in significant ways that may be better modeled using the techniques developed for understanding foraging under predation risk. We present a simple model of a common type of aggressive mimicry system in which mimics are predators and lure dupes by mimicry of a food resource. The model combines a simple model for foraging under risk of predation with signal detection theory. This modeling approach reveals 2 contrasting potential responses of dupes to mimics. Counterintuitively, dupes might be selected to become either more or less discriminating and risk averse as predators become more common or more memetic, depending on starting conditions relating to alternative resources available to the dupes. Implications of these divergent trajectories for aggressive mimicry systems are explored.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  4     Total Times Cited:  4     Cited Reference Count:  58 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1093/beheco/ary145     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),aggressive mimicry;foraging under predation risk;signal detection theory;CHEMICAL MIMICRY;EVOLUTION;ECOLOGY;PREDATION;DECEPTION;FIREFLIES;BEHAVIOR;Mathematics;Aggression,,

Moose (Alces alces) accumulate body energy and nutrient stores during summer, while reducing the impact of warm temperatures through physiological and behavioural thermoregulation. Building on the animal indicator concept, we used rumen temperature sensors and GPS collars on captive moose (n = 6) kept in large natural enclosures to evaluate how behaviour and habitat selection influence the rate of change in rumen temperature during the growing season on the Kenai Peninsula, Alaska, USA. We compared movement and habitat selection of individual females during tolerance days (daily amplitude in rumen temperature was >= 1.2 degrees C in 24 h) with those of control days (daily amplitude in rumen temperature was < 1.2 degrees C) before and after the tolerance day. Moose moved more during tolerance days (172 m . h(-1); 95% confidence intervals (CI) = 149-191 m . h(-1)) than on control days (151 m . h(-1); 95% CI = 128-173 m . h(-1)). The rate of change in rumen temperature (degrees C . h(-1)) declined with low to moderate movement rates that were probably associated with foraging in all habitats. Movement only increased the rate of change in rumen temperature at high activity (similar to > 500 m . h(-1)). Additionally, the relationship between rate of change in rumen temperature and movement rate was different during tolerance and control days in open meadow and wetland habitats. In all habitats except wetlands, the rate of change in rumen temperature increased while resting, which probably is a result of diet-induced thermogenesis. Our study demonstrates that the behavioural choices of moose on the landscape are associated with the rate of change in rumen temperature and their ability to thermoregulate. Wildlife managers must consider high-value habitats where wildlife can employ both behavioural and physiological mechanisms to tolerate warm ambient conditions in a landscape of forage, predators and pests.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  88 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1093/conphys/coaa130     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Activity;Alaska;Alces alces;behaviour;moose;rumen temperature;thermoregulation;BODY-TEMPERATURE;BLACK WILDEBEEST;NUTRITIONAL CONDITION;THERMAL ENVIRONMENT;ENERGY LANDSCAPES;HABITAT SELECTION;ACTIVITY PATTERNS;SOLAR-RADIATION;PREDATION RISK;CLIMATE-CHANGE;Body Temperature Regulation;Seasons,,

Recently the role of kinship in CBP has been in focus, and some studies have demonstrated high host-parasite relatedness in avian CBP systems. However, high natal and breeding site fidelity of hosts and parasites complicates the interpretation of previous observational findings, and the mechanisms leading to high host-parasite relatedness remain unknown. Some recent findings suggest that broadening the scope of the study of interactions may cast light on these mechanisms. We studied relatedness between parasites laying in the same nest (co-parasites) and factors possibly driving relatedness patterns between co-parasites in the common goldeneye, Bucephala clangula. Based on a field experiment, controlling for site fidelity and host role, we report here that both relatedness and safety of the nest site, and their interaction, affected the likelihood of two females engaging in co-parasitism. At the population level, parasites indeed seemed to lay eggs preferentially with kin. Analyses at a finer spatial scale revealed that high relatedness between co-parasites was not due to the philopatry effect only. Parasites engaging in co-parasitism also laid in safer neighbourhoods than parasites that did not engage in co-parasitism; the number of nondepredated nesting attempts the previous year was higher for the parasites engaging in co-parasitism. However, the interaction between relatedness and safety of the nest site suggests that co-parasitism at dangerous lakes was more likely to involve relatives. Our results provide the first experimental evidence that nest predation risk and interaction between related parasites are associated with kin-biased co-parasitism in a CBP system.

In existing theory, this movement occurs through the adoption of possible ""movement rules"" that differ in their cognitive complexity. Here, we investigate the effectiveness of different previously suggested rules in reducing risk for central and peripheral individuals within a group. We demonstrate that initial spatial position is important in determining the success of different risk-reducing movement rules, as initially centrally positioned individuals are likely to be more successful than peripheral ones at reducing their risk relative to other group members, regardless of the movement rules used. Simpler strategies are effective in low-density populations; but at high density, more complex rules are more effective. We also find that complex rules that consider the position of multiple neighbors are the only rules that successfully allow individuals to move from peripheral to central positions or maintain central positions, thus avoiding predators that attack from outside the group. Our results suggest that the attack strategy of a predator should be critically important in determining prey escape strategies in a selfish herd context and that prey should modify their behavioral responses to impending attack in response to their position within a group.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  34     Total Times Cited:  35     Cited Reference Count:  38 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1093/beheco/arq157     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),aggregation;antipredator behavior;grouping;group center;individual-based model;periphery;predation risk;PREDATION RISK;AGGREGATION BEHAVIOR;ANIMAL GROUPS;SIZE CHOICE;FISH SHOALS;MODEL;AVOIDANCE;DANGER;ATTACK;SEGREGATION,,

Few studies, however, have documented selection on behavioural responses that increase individual survival under human hunting pressure. Using habitat with dense concealing cover is a common strategy for risk avoidance, with a higher chance of survival being the payoff. At the same time, risk avoidance can be costly in terms of missed foraging opportunities. We investigated individual fine-scale use of habitat by 40 GPS-marked European red deer, Cervus elaphus, and linked this to their survival through the hunting season. Whereas all males used similar habitat in the days before the hunting season, the onset of hunting induced an immediate switch to habitat with more concealing cover in surviving males, but not in males that were later shot. This habitat switch also involved a trade-off with foraging opportunities on bilberry, Vaccinium myrtillus, a key forage plant in autumn. Moreover, deer that use safer forest habitat might survive better because they make safer choices in general. The lack of a corresponding pattern in females might be because females were already largely using cover when hunting started, as predicted by sexual segregation theory and the risk of losing offspring. The behavioural response of males to the onset of hunting appears to be adaptive, given that it is linked to increased survival, an important fitness component. We suggest that predictable harvesting regimes with high harvest rates could create a strong selective pressure for deer to respond dynamically to the temporal change in hunting risk. Management should consider the potential for both ecological and evolutionary consequences of harvesting regimes on behaviour. (C) 2015 The Authors.

We used data from two small game reserves in northern South Africa to relate the presence of African lions to abundance, habitat use, diet, and prey selection of two sympatric large carnivores, brown hyaenas (Parahyaena brunnea) and leopards (Panthera pardus). Our results offered some support for the facilitative effects of lions on brown hyaenas, and competitive effects on leopards. However, differences between populations living without and with lions were restricted to broad diet composition and appear not to have permeated into differences in either prey selection, abundance or habitat use. Therefore, we suggest that the potential effects of lions on the predator-prey interactions of sympatric predators may have been context dependent or absent, and subsequently argue that lions may not necessarily influence the predator-prey dynamics in the landscapes they live in beyond those caused by their own predatory behaviour.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  2     Total Times Cited:  2     Cited Reference Count:  72 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.3390/d12090325     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),community ecology;predation;interference competition;landscape of fear;apex predator;Carnivora;African lion;African leopard;brown hyaena;PANTHERA-PARDUS;DIET;PREDATORS;HAIR;MICROSTRUCTURE;MESOCARNIVORES;DIVERSITY;BEHAVIOR;PROVINCE;OVERLAP,,

Movement analysis of GPS-collared individuals from both species revealed high plasticity in habitat-selection decisions of caribou.

Game theoretic models of how animals manage predation risk have begun to describe predator responses to prey behaviour relatively recently. This is partly because our understanding of how terrestrial predators select vertebrate prey is often limited to numerical and functional responses to measures of prey abundance. Prey vulnerability, however, may improve our understanding of predation because predators could maximize foraging success by selecting prey on this basis.        2. We tested the hypothesis that sparrowhawks (Accipiter nisus L.), a typical generalist predator, hunt redshanks (Tringa totanus L.), a favoured prey species on coastal shores, primarily on the basis of their vulnerability rather than their abundance.        3. Five direct measures or indicators of redshank behaviour predicted sparrowhawk attack success in a multipredictor statistical model and therefore serve as measures of redshank vulnerability.        4. These and other vulnerability measures influenced whether sparrowhawks decided to hunt redshanks on saltmarsh habitat. A model that included most of these measures predicted correctly whether sparrowhawks hunted redshanks (attack decision) 90% of the time and accounted for up to 75% of variation. Prey abundance accounted for no additional variation.        5. Thus the hunting behaviour of some predators can only be predicted well by several highly dynamic and interacting factors related to prey vulnerability.

One potential explanation for these aggregations is provided by the selfish herd hypothesis, which states that aggregations result from individual efforts to reduce personnel predation risk at the expense of group-mates. Not all movement rules based on the selfish herd hypothesis are consistent with observed animal behavior. Previous work has shown that herd-like aggregations are not generated by movement rules limited to local interactions between nearest neighbors. Instead, rules generating realistic herds appear to require delocalized interactions. To date, it has been an open question whether or not the necessary delocalization can emerge from local interactions under natural selection. To address this question, we study an individual-based model with a single quantitative genetic trait that controls the influence of neighbors as a function of distance. The results indicate that predation-based selection can increase the influence of distant neighbors relative to near neighbors. Our results lend support for the idea that selfish herd behavior can arise from localized movement rules under natural selection. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we present novel extensions of a game theory modeling framework to investigate the evolutionary mechanisms of DPM in a bird population. We reveal that increasing either the maximum survival rate or predation risk can promote the evolution of DPM. Longer life span and transferrable physical condition between breeding years show a significant mutual promotion effect on DPM evolution, and would also enable the evolution of DPM in some species with no reproductive output in year one. Our models indicate that sufficiently high investment on adult plumage is essential for the evolution of DPM, which is consistent with some previous empirical studies. Finally, we highlight the significance of condition-dependent male parental care and provide new insight into how sexual conflict over parental care between parents may influence the evolution of DPM in birds.

The endangered European hamster benefits from conservation programs throughout Europe, in which several thousand individuals are released into the wild every year. Despite this, the anti-predator strategy of hamsters and their ability to maintain predator discrimination in captivity remain to be investigated. Here, we explore the predator discrimination behaviour of captive-reared European hamsters and their response to different predation cues. When first exposed to the urine of cats and goats in a Y-maze test, hamsters spent more time close to the cat scent rather than to the goat scent. In a second experiment, during which hamsters were exposed to a non-mobile European ferret (inside a cage), hamsters significantly increased the time spent close to the ferret's cage and displayed aggressive behaviour towards the ferret. Furthermore, they did not take refuge inside an anti-predation tube (APT), a device designed to upgrade wildlife underpasses and reconnect wild hamster populations. Finally, when exposed to a mobile ferret (but without physical contact), hamsters displayed mobbing and aggressive behaviours towards the ferret, before taking refuge inside the APT. Taken together, our results show that captive-reared hamsters are still able to detect and react to predation cues, but that they initially adopt an offensive strategy (grunting, spitting, mobbing) during the risk-assessment phase. After risk assessment, however, hamsters used the APT as a refuge. Our study provides important insights into the anti-predator behaviour of hamsters. Testing the efficacy of the APT, a device that will allow upgrading wildlife underpasses for the hamster and other rodents, is also of great importance and is instrumental in conservation efforts for these species.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  1     Total Times Cited:  2     Cited Reference Count:  56 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1371/journal.pone.0210158     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),ANTI-PREDATION DEVICE;CRICETUS-CRICETUS;SMALL MAMMALS;BEHAVIOR;ODORS;PERSONALITY;FACILITATE;DEFENSE;MODELS;SECURE;Risk Assessment;Cricetinae,,

This increases the acquisition of resources, which in turn, may help to sustain a higher MR. Elevated predation danger may be expected to result in reduced MRs, either as a means of allowing for reduced feeding and risk-taking, or as a consequence of adaptively reducing intake rates via reduced feeding and/or risk-taking. We tested this prediction in free-living great tits (Parus major) using a playback experiment to manipulate perceived predation danger. There was evidence that changes in body mass and BMR differed as a function of treatment. In predator treatment plots, great tits tended to reduce their body mass, a commonly observed response in birds to increased predation danger. In contrast, birds from control treatment plots showed no overall changes in body mass. There was also evidence that great tits from control treatment plots increased their basal metabolic rate (BMR) over the course of the experiment, presumably due to decreasing ambient temperatures over the study period. However, there was no evidence for changes in BMR for birds from predator treatment plots. Although the directions of these results are consistent with the predicted directions of effects, the effects sizes and confidence intervals yield inconclusive support for the hypothesis that great tits would adaptively suppress BMR in response to increased perceived predation risk. The effect size observed in the present study was small (similar to 1%) and would not be expected to result in substantive reductions in feeding rate and/or risk-taking. Whether or not ecological conditions that generate greater energetic stress (e.g. lower food availability, lower ambient temperatures) could produce an effect that produces biologically meaningful reductions in feeding activity and/or risk-taking remains an open question.

Prey dynamics in these models often reflect a compromise between prey reproductive potential, density-dependent competition, and the direct consumption of prey by predators. But predators and prey play a complex evolutionary game where prey behavior, and its effect on distribution and abundance, depends on predation risk. Risk is subsequently modified by adaptive predator responses. Many of the co-adaptive behaviors are likely to involve a spatial component where density-dependent habitat selection can mask prey competition. I explored the consequences of the predator-prey habitat-selection game with numerical simulations of two classical predator-prey models. Two species of prey and their predator attempted to maximize their fitness by choosing between two distinctly different habitats. The simulations included exogenous stochastic effects on prey density and explored large changes in individual parameters. Several common themes emerge from both models. (1) Habitat selection promotes community persistence. (2) Predators and prey often persist at an ideal-free ""equilibrium"". (3) Single habitats often include only a single food chain (predator and one prey species), whereas pairs of habitats always include the complete web of three species. (4) Habitat selection can cause rapid and occasional reciprocal reversals in predator habitat use and habitat abandonment. (5) Predators reduce prey numbers. (6) Predators reinforce prey habitat preferences that further reduce their net competitive interaction. The adaptive behaviors played out in the evolutionary games among interacting species are thereby etched deeply into the dynamics of their populations and the structure of their emergent communities.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  13     Total Times Cited:  13     Cited Reference Count:  58 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1560/X4AH-6REB-YKEY-E45Q     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),EXPLOITATION ECOSYSTEMS;UNEQUAL COMPETITORS;GERBIL ISOCLINE;COEXISTENCE;DYNAMICS;SHAPE;HETEROGENEITY;ENVIRONMENTS;EVOLUTION;FITNESS;Prednisolone,,

However, the positive relationship observed may also result from a mathematical artefact. Meanwhile, it is unknown whether animals would consistently follow this rule in different environmental contexts. We explored escape behaviours in light-vented bulbuls (Pycnonotus sinensis) perched at different heights. FID generally increased with increasing AD and decreasing perch height. The positive relationships between AD and FID were outside the 95% confidence levels of simulated slopes from Monte Carlo simulations, suggesting that the relationships observed reflect biological effects rather than merely a mathematical artefact. Increasing perch height was also associated with longer buffer distance (defined as FID minus AD orSD), suggesting that the birds tend to delay their flush after detecting an approaching predator when perched high.

Therefore, effective wildlife management, including harvesting through hunting is becoming increasingly important. However, current hunting practices often fail to diminish those negative effects, as many ungulate species retreat to areas unsuitable for hunting. This predator-avoidance behaviour makes it difficult to fulfill the demand of reducing population numbers. Thus, there is an urgent need for innovative and effective wildlife management tools to counteract this problem. Here we provide for the first time a hunting suitability model for wild ungulate management in mountainous landscapes to visualise hunting suitability objectively and realistically. Using red deer as a model species, we modelled hunting suitability with high spatial resolution (10 x 10 m), based on remote sensing information, field surveys and expert knowledge of professional hunters. We analysed spatio-temporal habitat selection by radio-collared deer in relation to locations of varying hunting suitability. The suitability of various locations regarding hunting influenced the spatio-temporal habitat selection by this species, consistent with our hypothesis. Red deer avoided areas suitable for hunting during daylight hours in the hunting season, but not during the night. This species seems to perceive a landscape of heterogeneous anthropogenic predation risk, shaped by locations of various hunting suitability, as we modelled it. This confirms the empirical realism of the model. Concerning wild ungulate management, our hunting suitability model provides high-resolution predictions of where species like red deer will retreat when perceived anthropogenic predation risk increases. The model also yields useful insights regarding the hunting suitability of particular locations, which is valuable information especially for non-locals. Furthermore, the model can serve as planning tool to inform decisions about where particular hunting strategies can be performed most efficiently to manage wild ungulates and therefore minimize human-wildlife conflicts.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  43 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1002/wlb3.01021     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),accessibility;GPS telemetry;landscape of fear (LOF);red deer;spatio-temporal habitat use;transportability;ungulate management;visibility;WHITE-TAILED DEER;HABITAT SELECTION;RED DEER;PREDATION;MANAGEMENT;LANDSCAPE;RESPONSES;BEHAVIOR,,

I used an individual-based simulation comprising sit-and-wait predators, widely foraging herbivores, and plants, to examine the link between predator ambush location, herbivore movement, and plant aggregation. I used a genetic algorithm to reach the best strategies for all players. The predators could ambush herbivores either inside or outside plant patches. The herbivores could use movement of varying directionality levels, with a change in directionality following the detection of plants. When the predators were fixed outside plant patches, the herbivores were selected to use a directional movement before plant encounter followed by a tortuous movement afterwards. When predators were fixed inside patches, herbivores used a continuous directional movement. Predators maintained within-patch positions when the herbivores were fixed to use the directional-tortuous movement. The predator location inside patches led to higher plant aggregations, by changing the herbivore movement. Finally, I allowed half of the predators to search for herbivores and let them compete with sit-and-wait predators located inside plant patches. When plants were clumped and herbivores used a directional-tortuous movement, with a movement shift after plant detection, ambush predators had the highest success relative to widely foraging predators. In all other scenarios, widely foraging predators did much better than ambush predators. The findings from my simulation suggest a behavioral mechanism for several observed phenomena of predator-prey interactions, such as a shorter stay by herbivores in patches when predators ambush them nearby, and a more directional movement of herbivores in riskier habitats.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  1     Total Times Cited:  1     Cited Reference Count:  73 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1093/beheco/arab091     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),area-restricted search;foraging mode;habitat selection;individual-based model;movement;optimal foraging;predator-prey behavioral game;HABITAT SELECTION GAMES;SPATIAL AGGREGATION;FORAGING BEHAVIOR;PREY DISTRIBUTION;RISK;CONSEQUENCES;EFFICIENCY;FISH;ECOLOGY;VIPERS;Prednisolone,,

For instance, patches that lack predators may be avoided when located near others with predators, a pattern known as risk contagion. Alternatively, predator avoidance might also redirect dispersal towards nearby predator-free patches resulting in so-called habitat compression. However, it is largely unknown how predators continue to influence these habitat selection behaviours at increasing distances from outside of their own habitat patch. In addition, current information is derived from artificial mesocosm experiments, while support from natural ecosystems is lacking.        This study used bromeliad landscapes as a natural model system to study how oviposition habitat selection of Diptera responds to the cues of a distant predator, the carnivorous elephant mosquito larva.        We established landscapes containing predator-free bromeliad habitat patches placed at increasing distances from a predator-containing patch, along with replicate control landscapes. These patches were then left to be colonized by ovipositing bromeliad insects.        We found that distance to predators modulates habitat selection decisions. Moreover, different dipteran families had different responses suggesting different habitat selection strategies. In some families, predator-free patches at certain distances from the predator patch were avoided, confirming risk contagion. In other families, these patches received higher numbers of colonists providing evidence of predator-induced habitat compression.        We confirm that effects of predators in a natural ecosystem can extend beyond the patch in which the predator is present and that the presence or absence of remote predator effects on habitat selection depends on the distance to predators. The notion that perceived habitat quality can depend on conditions in neighbouring patches forces habitat selection studies to adopt a landscape perspective and account for the effects of both present and remote predators when explaining community assembly in metacommunities.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  4     Total Times Cited:  4     Cited Reference Count:  41 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/1365-2656.13239     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),bromeliads;context dependence;habitat compression;habitat selection;oviposition site selection;predation risk;risk contagion;HABITAT SELECTION;BEHAVIORAL-RESPONSES;CUES;OVIPOSITION;SIZE;KAIROMONES;CONTAGION;DIGESTION;DYNAMICS;INSIGHTS;Prednisolone,,

Here, we predicted that rodents should avoid predator odor and open habitats to reduce their probability of encounter with potential predators, and tested our predictions using a native Australian desert rodent, the spinifex hopping-mouse (Notomys alexis). We tested the foraging and movement responses of N. alexis to non-native predator (fox and cat) odor, in sheltered and open macro-and microhabitats. Rodents did not respond to predator odor, perhaps reflecting the inconsistent selection pressure that is imposed on prey species in the desert environment due to the transience of predator-presence. However, they foraged primarily in the open and moved preferentially across open sand. The results suggest that N. alexis relies on escape rather than avoidance behavior when managing predation risk, with its bipedal movement probably allowing it to exploit open environments most effectively.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  21     Total Times Cited:  21     Cited Reference Count:  75 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1371/journal.pone.0090566     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),PATCH USE;BEHAVIORAL-RESPONSES;FORAGING BEHAVIOR;TIME ALLOCATION;SMALL MAMMALS;BUSH RATS;PREY;RAINFALL;MARSUPIALIA;ASSEMBLAGES;Cues;Prednisolone;Rodentia,,

These species are remarkably convergent, except that sidewinders possess heat-sensitive pit organs that enable them to ""see"" in the dark. As a constraint-breaking adaptation, this may give sidewinders an advantage when hunting in the dark. How will introducing a novel predator with a constraint-breaking adaptation affect the local species? We allowed Saharan horned vipers to hunt Allenby's gerbils (Gerbillus andersoni allenbyi) in patches with or without sidewinders at full and new moon. When horned vipers hunted alone, moonlight did not affect their foraging behavior. However, in the presence of sidewinders, horned vipers increased their activity on bright nights, but dramatically decreased it on dark nights. Although gerbils foraged equally when hunted by either snake, the combined effect of the 2 predators synergistically decreased gerbil foraging, especially during full moon when both snakes were most active. Thus, sidewinders facilitated horned vipers in full moon, but interfered on darker nights when possessing pit organs were most advantageous for sidewinders. Gerbils quickly learned and adjusted their behavior to manage risks from the novel predators, but the combined effects of both local and novel predators may prove detrimental in the long run. Comparing convergent species that differ in a constraint-breaking adaptation allows us to study the effectiveness of these key adaptations and their potential roles in biological invasions.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  3     Total Times Cited:  3     Cited Reference Count:  28 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1093/jmammal/gyy085     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),biological invasions;constraint-breaking adaptations;facilitation;foraging behavior;interference competition;risk management;FORAGING BEHAVIOR;GERBILLINE RODENTS;SNAKES;VIPERS;POPULATIONS;COMPETITION;RATES;GAME;Prednisolone,,

The heteromyid rodents of North America and the gerbils of the Middle East and their predators provide such an example. Both sets of rodents face predation from owls and vipers, but the North American species possess unique traits that may represent macroevolutionary breakthroughs: rattlesnakes have infra-red sensitive sensory pits, and heteromyids have cheek pouches. To test their significance, we brought together two gerbils (Middle East), two heteromyid rodents (a kangaroo rat and a pocket mouse; North America) in a common setting (a vivarium in the Negev Desert), and quantified the opinions of the rodents towards the North American sidewinder rattlesnake and the Middle Eastern Saharan horned viper and the foraging behavior of each in the face of these snake predators plus owl predators. Gerbils are fairly evenly matched in their anti-predator abilities, while the heteromyids differ widely, and these seem to match well with and may determine the types of mechanisms of species coexistence that operate in the communities of each continent.

However, segregation can occur in juveniles before such roles or size dimorphism is well established. In young humans, leading hypotheses suggest that (1) sexes differ in their activity and the synchronisation of behaviour causes segregation and (2) sexes separate in order to learn and maximise future reproductive roles. We reared pheasants, Phasianus colchicus, from hatching in the absence of adults in a controlled environment. Females aggregated with their own sex from hatching, whereas males initially exhibited random association, but segregation became pronounced with age. The increase in segregation corresponded to an increase in sexual size dimorphism. By standardising habitat availability and diet and by removing predation risk, we could disregard the Predation Risk and the Forage Selection Hypotheses operating at this age. Activity budgets did not differ between the sexes, providing no support for the Behavioural Synchrony or the Activity Budget Hypotheses. Both sexes preferentially approached groups of unfamiliar, same-sex birds in binary choice tests, providing support for the Social Preference Hypothesis. Females may segregate to avoid male aggression. Sexual segregation may become established early in development, especially in precocial species, such as pheasants. A clear understanding of ontogenetic factors is essential to further our understanding of adult assortment patterns. Assortment by sex may not be inherent, but rather emerge as a consequence of social interactions early in life.        Significance statement        Hypotheses pertaining to the force driving sexual segregation typically rely on adult traits, such as size dimorphism or differences in sexual roles. However, in some species, animals segregate as juveniles, so that most hypotheses previously invoked to explain sexual segregation in adults are irrelevant. We reared pheasants, Phasianus colchicus, fromhatching and monitored multiple aspects of the chicks' life history in an effort to determine what causes sexual segregation. Females aggregate with their own sex from hatching, whereas males initially have a more random association, but segregation becomes pronounced as both sexes got older, coinciding with greater sexual dimorphism. We controlled for influences of predation risk and dietary/habitat choice and found that activity budgets did not differ between the sexes. Instead, we found that both sexes preferred their own sex when presented with a binary choice, providing evidence that social preference could drive sexual segregation in pheasants.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  11     Total Times Cited:  12     Cited Reference Count:  76 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s00265-017-2332-2     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Aggression;Body size dimorphism;Group living;Ontogeny;Social preference;Sexual segregation;SEXUAL SEGREGATION;FORAGING EFFICIENCY;POSSIBLE MECHANISM;DIMORPHIC DEER;WESTERN GREY;ALPINE IBEX;HABITAT USE;CAPRA-IBEX;BEHAVIOR;SHEEP,,

In this study, I investigated when it is optimal for a consumer to partition time and be aggressive. I formulated an individual-based model of foraging and used game theory to find evolutionarily stable strategies (ESSs) that maximize the probability that consumers survive each day and acquire their daily food requirements. Consumers choose when to forage and when to behave aggressively during confrontations over food. Consumers are each associated with a state variable, representing the amount of food eaten, and a dominance ranking, which describes how likely they are to forage and fight for food. The ESS is sensitive to food abundance, consumer state, and the dominance ranking. When food is abundant, temporal partitioning is often an ESS where the dominant consumer forages first; however, partitioning is unlikely to be an ESS when food abundance is low. Fights over food are typically avoided but may be part of an ESS when food abundance is low, both consumers are hungry, or the time available for foraging each day is drawing to a close. Because the ESS is sensitive to consumer state, the stochastic nature of finding food often results in considerable variation in observed foraging dynamics from one day to the next, even when consumers adopt the same state-dependent strategy each day. Results are compared with empirical observations, and I discuss implications for consumer coexistence.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  35     Total Times Cited:  37     Cited Reference Count:  45 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1093/beheco/13.3.427     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),aggression;coexistence;foraging;game theory;temporal partitioning;INTERFERENCE COMPETITION;NICHE DIFFERENCE;COEXISTENCE;BEHAVIOR;PREDATION;RISK;TIME;FOOD;STRATEGIES;NECTAR;Aggression,,

In some cases, they are linked and predator and prey are also competitors (intraguild predation). I present a game theoretic model of habitat use by predators and prey under conditions of asymmetrical intraguild predation. This model predicts that when the diet of intraguild predators is restricted to intraguild prey and the resource for which predators and prey compete (the basal resource), co-occurrence is only stable when dietary overlap is low and productivity of the basal resource is not high. The addition of alternative resources for predators results in co-occurrence under all conditions. Variation in alternative resource productivity produces a continuum of intraguild prey distributions from matching relative habitat safety, to one that reflects both food and predation risk. When there is a substantial alternative resource for predators, the distribution of predators matches that of alternative resource availability while the distribution of prey is influenced by both habitat riskiness and food availability. The density and distribution of the predator's alternative resource thus influence habitat selection by the intraguild prey. This stresses the importance of indirect interactions in structuring habitat use in communities and the need to view habitat selection in a community context.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  89     Total Times Cited:  92     Cited Reference Count:  46 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Included""}",10.1034/j.1600-0706.2001.920315.x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),IDEAL FREE DISTRIBUTIONS;FOOD-WEB COMPLEXITY;ENERGETIC EQUIVALENCE;RISK;COMPETITORS;ECOLOGY;GAME;DOGS;Prednisolone;Ecosystem,,

We studied the effects of human hunting on the movement of GPS-collared female wild boar. We found that the hunting method affected whether the wild boar fled or hid. After fleeing into refuge ranges, wild boar moved less and preferred habitats that provided cover and forage such as mast or crops. This suggests that the wild boar tried to reduce the risk of being detected, and possibly also that they avoided competition with resident wild boar in the refuge by using forage that could not be monopolised. The type of hunting thus strongly affected the type of avoidance behaviour displayed by wild boar, with implications for their movement and space use.

Selection should favor animals that make good trade-offs between sleep attributes (e.g., location, timing, duration) and predation risk, in other words, sleep should be facultative. The few studies that document sleep plasticity in response to predation risk have focused on endothermic vertebrates. We tested the hypothesis that a representative ectothermic vertebrate, the Desert Iguana (Dipsosaurus dorsalis), exhibits behavioral sleep plasticity in response to predation risk. We found a reduction (> 50%) in total sleep time during daylight when Desert Iguanas were exposed continuously to a Sidewinder (Crotalus cerastes) in a laboratory setting. During asynchronous eye closure (ASEC) bouts, the eye of the iguana distant to the Sidewinder was more often closed, whereas the proximal eye was more often open, suggesting unihemispheric sleep (which has not been confirmed yet in reptiles) to maintain vigilance. Desert Iguanas spent more time aboveground and less time within their burrows when the Sidewinder was present. Snake activity was minimal, with movements occurring just 1.1% of the time, suggesting that iguanas were not merely responding to a moving object. Our findings suggest that Desert Iguanas will forgo sleep and remain vigilant when the potential for predation is increased.

Some mammals exhibit behavioral plasticity in activity patterns, which allows them to adapt to environmental changes. A good example of this can be found in the red fox Vulpes vulpes. This species is adapted to living in highly humanized environments, where it is often culled because it may affect human interests (e.g. through the consumption of game species or livestock). We assessed the potential main drivers of the daily activity patterns of the red fox in 12 Iberian Mediterranean areas through the use of camera traps. Among drivers, we considered main prey availability (European wild rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus), degree of human disturbance (e.g. distance to human settlements, and intensity of predator control) and habitat structure. Our results revealed a predominantly crepuscular and nocturnal activity of foxes with local variations. Although overall fox activity increased with rabbit availability, the temporal overlap with prey activity was on average low, because foxes increased activity when rabbits decreased theirs (twilight-night). Red fox activity rhythms seemed to be determined by human presence where human disturbance is high. In addition, diurnal activity decreased in areas with higher levels of human disturbance (closer to human settlements and high predator control intensity) and increased in dense habitats. Our study shows that daily activity patterns of highly adaptable species are determined by several interacting drivers, resulting in complex behavioral patterns. This suggests that further ecological studies should consider different factors simultaneously for a better understanding of daily activity patterns of wildlife in different landscapes.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  46     Total Times Cited:  49     Cited Reference Count:  54 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/jzo.12294     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),activity patterns;behavioral plasticity;camera trap;circadian rhythms;human disturbance;predator control;red fox;ACTIVITY PATTERNS;HOME-RANGE;PREDATOR;CARNIVORE;MANAGEMENT;RESPONSES;WOLVES;BEARS;RISK;GAME;Humanities;Humanism;Humans,,

The use of such evasive tactics likely affects the benefits of social learning, yet their effect on social information use has not hitherto been theoretically analysed. I developed a game-theoretical model aimed at exploring both the conditions under which the use of evasive tactics should be favoured and their impact on social information use. Specifically, the model applies to competition among males for access to females: males are not selective in their choice of mates, or they decide to retain or reject potential partners based on either the information obtained by personal sampling or the decisions of others. Furthermore, asocial learners may be of two types: either they respond to the presence of potential rivals by displaying reduced courtship behaviour, thereby reducing the amount of social information but also their own chance of success, or they always display normal behaviour. The model confirms that males may benefit from providing their rivals with reduced information, notably when they may prevent mate-choice copying without compromising their own mating success, and that audience effects may have important evolutionary consequences. Particularly, as the conditions favouring the use of evasive tactics depend on life history and ecological traits, these findings might contribute to explaining inter-specific differences in social information use.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  5     Total Times Cited:  5     Cited Reference Count:  60 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s00265-014-1831-7     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Social information use;Audience effects;Evasive tactics;Mate-choice copying;Courtship behaviour;Game theory;SOCIAL-LEARNING STRATEGIES;GUPPY POECILIA-RETICULATA;MALE MATE CHOICE;PUBLIC INFORMATION;SPERM COMPETITION;PREDATION RISK;INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES;DECEIVE COMPETITORS;EVOLUTION;PREFERENCES,,

Under this framework, an animal should ""give up"" when the benefits of foraging are outweighed by the costs (e.g., predation risk, energetic, and/or missed opportunity costs). However, animals of many species may forage in groups, and group size is expected to alter perceived predation risk and hence influence quitting decisions. Yet, most giving-up density studies assume either that individuals forage alone or that giving-up densities are not affected by group foraging. For animals that forage both alone and in groups, differences in giving-up densities due to group foraging rather than experimental variables may substantially alter interpretation. However, no research to date has directly investigated how group foraging affects the giving-up density. We used remote-sensing cameras to identify instances of group foraging in two species of Rattus across three giving-up density experiments to determine whether group foraging influences giving-up densities. Both Rattus species have been observed to vary between foraging alone and in groups. In all three experiments, solo foragers left higher giving-up densities on average than did group foragers. This result has important implications for studies using giving-up densities to investigate perceived risk, the energetic costs of searching, handling time, digestion, and missed opportunity costs, particularly if groups of animals are more likely to experience certain experimental treatments. It is critically important that future giving-up density studies consider the effects of group foraging.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  14     Total Times Cited:  14     Cited Reference Count:  38 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s00442-015-3274-x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),GUD;Rattus;Foraging ecology;Group foraging;Predation risk;RATS RATTUS-RATTUS;PREDATION RISK;BEHAVIOR;ADVANTAGES;HABITAT;MODEL,,

Nevertheless, the wide scope and generality of this phenomenon remain underestimated by the scientific community. This limited appreciation for the pervasiveness of recursive movement can be attributed to its study by parallel lines of research, with different methodologies and nomenclature, and almost no cross referencing among them. Among these lines of studies are traplining behavior in foraging ecology, path recursions in movement ecology and the ecology of fear in predator-prey studies. We synthesize these three lines of research, to underline the mechanisms driving these patterns and create a conceptual model for recursive movement behavior across species and spatio-temporal scales. The emergence and complexity of recursive movement patterns are determined by the rate of resource recovery, environmental heterogeneity, the predictability of resource recovery, and the animal's cognitive capabilities. Our synthesis can be used to generate predictions within and among systems, as well as to promote the sharing of knowledge and methodologies gained in each sub-field. Such sharing can greatly advance our understanding of behavioral and ecological processes and provide novel opportunities for future research.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  47     Total Times Cited:  47     Cited Reference Count:  76 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1890/ES15-00106.1     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),bumblebees;circular path;conceptual model;foraging;periodicity;predator-prey interactions;route optimization;shell games;spatial memory;traplining;BUMBLE-BEES;SPATIAL MEMORY;ANIMAL MOVEMENT;ECOLOGY PARADIGM;FORAGING SUCCESS;PREY;RESOURCE;PREDATOR;POLLINATORS;POPULATION;Movement,,

Management decisions made in one portion of a landscape may induce spatial and temporal shifts of wildlife use in another, creating tension among private, state, and federal lands with varying missions. Recent declines in migratory behavior have initiated studies focused primarily on spring migration, but the timing and benefits of autumn migration have received limited attention due to the difficulty in assessing the extreme asynchrony in autumnal events, although nutrition during this time period is crucial to winter survival and reproduction. Here, we used five years of data from 73 female elk (Cervus canadensis) which utilize a landscape managed by 4 federal agencies, a state, and private landowners, to identify the driving factors behind the initiation of fall migration in two subpopulations, one of which migrates to a protected area where hunting is prohibited. Most elk departed summer range prior to frost or snow, with 67% of elk that used the protected area migrating prior to the onset of archery hunting season (1 September), preemptively avoiding risk, while no elk from the other subpopulation left prior to archery season. However, departure from productive summer range prior to frost or snow, nearly two months before vegetation senescence, led to an important tradeoff. Early migrants gave up 0.30% of late summer-fall integrated NDVI (iNDVI) per day when they moved to the safety of the protected area, leading to an average difference of 15.81% in iNDVI between an individual departing on 30 August (the mean departure date) vs. an individual departing on 1 November. Our results suggest that in areas where migratory ungulates span multiple jurisdictions, the benefits of migratory behavior may be dramatically impacted by unevenly distributed anthropogenic disturbance. As this is a common scenario globally, our work highlights the urgent need to improve our understanding of subtle changes in migratory behavior, both spatially and temporally, which may erode the resilience of migration to future change.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  3     Total Times Cited:  3     Cited Reference Count:  92 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1002/ecs2.2693     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),forage;hunting;migration;predation;protected area;refugia;risk allocation;tradeoff;WHITE-TAILED DEER;CHANGE-POINT ANALYSIS;PREDATION RISK;HABITAT USE;BEHAVIORAL-RESPONSES;SPRING MIGRATION;WOODLAND CARIBOU;AUTUMN NUTRITION;PLANT PHENOLOGY;CERVUS-ELAPHUS,,

Animals can decrease mortality risk searching for predators, but searching decreases foraging time and hence intake. We used this principle to investigate how prey should use information to detect, assess and respond to predation risk from an optimal foraging perspective. A mathematical model showed that solitary bees should increase flower examination time in response to predator cues and that the rate of false alarms should be negatively correlated with the relative value of the flower explored. The predatory ant, Oecophylla smaragdina, and the harmless ant, Polyrhachis dives, differ in the profile of volatiles they emit and in their visual appearance. As predicted, the solitary bee Nomia strigata spent more time examining virgin flowers in presence of predator cues than in their absence. Furthermore, the proportion of flowers rejected decreased from morning to noon, as the relative value of virgin flowers increased. In addition, bees responded differently to visual and chemical cues. While chemical cues induced bees to search around flowers, bees detecting visual cues hovered in front of them. These strategies may allow prey to identify the nature of visual cues and to locate the source of chemical cues.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  13     Total Times Cited:  13     Cited Reference Count:  43 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1098/rspb.2013.0886     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),chemical perception;predator-prey interactions;predation risk;predator detection;terrestrial insects;visual perception;SENSITIVE PREDATOR-AVOIDANCE;WEAVER ANTS;RECOGNITION;FLOWERS;SCENT;RISK;FISH;BEES;INSPECTION;Cues,,

Moreover, the scale at which the response of prey is assessed has important implications for discovering how predation risk alters prey behavior. Herein, we assessed space use of wild Ring-necked Pheasants (Phasianus colchicus) in response to spatial and temporal variation in recreational hunting. We radio-marked pheasants and monitored space use at two spatial scales: short-term seasonal home range, and nightly resting locations. Additionally, we considered temporal variation in predation risk by monitoring space use prior to and during the pheasant hunting season. Although we found no change in nightly resting location, pheasants subjected to predation risk expanded their home range and shifted home range location even when invulnerable to predation. Home range formation was plastic, with home ranges expanding and contracting as risk fluctuated before and during the hunting season. Depredation reduced the measured response within the population, obscuring the potential importance of perceived predation risk in shaping prey communities, particularly when not measured at the appropriate scale. By assessing space use of a wild prey population at multiple scales, considering spatial and temporal variation in predation risk, we show that not only does predation risk affect space use, but that the effects at the population level may be challenging to assess when not measured at the appropriate ecological scale because of the direct effects of differential mortality on the same behaviors.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  3     Total Times Cited:  3     Cited Reference Count:  105 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1371/journal.pone.0222272     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),HOME-RANGE SIZE;HABITAT SELECTION;TEMPORAL VARIATION;ANTIPREDATOR RESPONSE;BEHAVIORAL DECISIONS;SAMPLE-SIZE;ROE DEER;RISK;ELK;LANDSCAPE;Prednisolone,,

The predators and prey are modeled as self-propelled particles moving in a three-dimensional domain and subject to specific sensing abilities and behavioral rules inspired by bat hunting. The predators randomly search for prey. The prey either align velocity directions with peers, defined as ""interacting"" prey, or swarm ""independently"" of peer presence; both types of prey are subject to additive noise. In a simulation study, we find that interacting prey using low noise have the maximum predation avoidance because they form localized large groups, while they suffer high predation as noise increases due to the formation of broadly dispersed small groups. Independent prey, which are likely to be uniformly distributed in the domain, have higher predation risk under a low noise regime as they traverse larger spatial extents. These effects are enhanced in large prey populations, which exhibit more ordered collective behavior or more uniform spatial distribution as they are interacting or independent, respectively.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  10     Total Times Cited:  10     Cited Reference Count:  60 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1103/PhysRevE.88.062724     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),SELF-PROPELLED PARTICLES;PATTERN-FORMATION;EPTESICUS-FUSCUS;PHASE-TRANSITION;ANIMAL GROUPS;SOUND BEAM;GROUP-SIZE;MOTION;FISH;FIELD;Prednisolone,,

This is important because a prey animal might have inadvertently arrived at a patch on which a sit-and-wait predator is lurking, a common situation in many species of animals. In a simulation model, we explore how long the ambushing predator should wait before attacking the prey animal and how the prey animal can adjust its vigilance in response. We adopted a war-of-attrition framework where the predator selects randomly an attack time from a distribution to keep the prey guessing and where the prey also keep the predator guessing by selecting randomly a time at which to switch from high to low vigilance. We found that an evolutionarily stable solution can emerge in this game and has the following form under a broad range of ecological conditions: the predator attacks early and the prey adopts a high vigilance early and then switches later to a lower vigilance. The results indicate that antipredator vigilance may change as a function of time rather than being a constant value as assumed in most vigilance models. We conclude that the uncertainty that ambushing predators and their prey must plant in the minds of the other can have important consequences for the evolution of predator and prey tactics.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  4     Total Times Cited:  5     Cited Reference Count:  26 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Included""}",10.1093/beheco/arr181     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),antipredator vigilance;predator-prey relationship;time;war of attrition;WAITING GAME;BEHAVIOR;RISK;PATTERNS;RANDOMNESS;EVOLUTION;FLOCKING;War;Prednisolone,,

Deterrents, which act to establish avoidance behaviours in animals, have the potential to aid anti-poaching efforts by moving at-risk rhinos away from areas of danger (e.g. near perimeter fences). To evaluate the efficacy of deterrents, we exposed a population of southern white rhinos (C. simum simum) to acoustic- (honeybee, siren, turtle dove), olfactory- (chilli, sunflower), and drone-based stimuli on a game reserve in South Africa. We exposed rhino to each stimulus up to four times. Stimuli were considered effective deterrents if they repeatedly elicited avoidance behaviour (locomotion away from the deterrent). Rhinos travelled significantly further in response to the siren than to the honeybee or turtle dove stimulus, and to low-altitude drone flights than to higher altitude flights. We found the drone to be superior at manipulating rhino movement than the siren owing to its longer transmission range and capability of pursuit. By contrast, the scent stimuli were ineffective at inciting avoidance behaviour. Our findings indicate that deterrents are a prospective low-cost and in situ method to manage rhino movement in game reserves.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  11     Total Times Cited:  11     Cited Reference Count:  53 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1098/rspb.2019.1135     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),rhinoceros;anti-poaching;drones;unmanned aerial vehicle;deterrents;behaviour;HUMAN-ELEPHANT CONFLICT;FARM-BASED MEASURES;LOXODONTA-AFRICANA;DETERRENTS;PREDATION;DISTRICT;EFFICACY;DEFENSE;SYSTEMS;SEALS;European Continental Ancestry Group,,

In this study, we examined escape responses of gopher tortoises approached by a human observer. Our data supported our prediction that the level of disturbance would influence escape responses, with animals that were picked and handled taking longer to emerge and move off than animals that had simply been approached or approached and walked around. We also found that tortoises took half as long to extend their heads at our study site, where tortoises exposed to a high level of benign human activity over a long period, compared with an adjacent site where there had been minimal human interaction with tortoises. These data suggest that gopher tortoises adjust their escape responses according to the level of risk they are exposed to. Over the long-team, this plasticity in escape responses can potentially result in some level of habituation to human presence.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  6     Total Times Cited:  6     Cited Reference Count:  47 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1163/1568539X-00003184     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),defence;defensive behaviour;emergence latency;escape;FID;flight initiation distance;reptile;testudine;HIDING BEHAVIOR;WAITING GAME;LIZARDS;METAANALYSIS;DECISIONS;PREDATION;SURVIVAL;FLORIDA;PREY;SQUIRRELS;Humanities;Humanism;Humans;Risk Assessment,,

This is especially true for large carnivores as these species are not always tolerated by the public and can pose a risk to human safety. Unfortunately, information on wildlife species within the wildland-urban interface is sparse, and knowledge from wildland ecosystems does not always translate well to human-dominated systems. Across western North America, cougars (Puma concolor) are routinely utilizing wildland-urban habitats while human use of these areas for homes and recreation is increasing. From 2007 to 2015, we studied cougar resource selection, human-cougar interaction, and cougar conflict management within the wildland-urban landscape of the northern Front Range in Colorado, USA. Resource selection of cougars within this landscape was typical of cougars in more remote settings but cougar interactions with humans tended to occur in locations cougars typically selected against, especially those in proximity to human structures. Within higher housing density areas, 83% of cougar use occurred at night, suggesting cougars generally avoided human activity by partitioning time. Only 24% of monitored cougars were reported for some type of conflict behavior but 39% of cougars sampled during feeding site investigations of GPS collar data were found to consume domestic prey items. Aversive conditioning was difficult to implement and generally ineffective for altering cougar behaviors but was thought to potentially have long-term benefits of reinforcing fear of humans in cougars within human-dominated areas experiencing little cougar hunting pressure. Cougars are able to exploit wildland-urban landscapes effectively, and conflict is relatively uncommon compared with the proportion of cougar use. Individual characteristics and behaviors of cougars within these areas are highly varied; therefore, conflict management is unique to each situation and should target individual behaviors. The ability of individual cougars to learn to exploit these environments with minimal human-cougar interactions suggests that maintaining older age structures, especially females, and providing a matrix of habitats, including large connected open-space areas, would be beneficial to cougars and effectively reduce the potential for conflict.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  7     Total Times Cited:  7     Cited Reference Count:  86 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1002/ece3.5559     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),aversive conditioning;Colorado;conflict;Cougar;domestic predation;human interaction;livestock;predation;Puma concolor;residential development;wildland-urban interface;HOME-RANGE;HABITAT SELECTION;LARGE CARNIVORE;BLACK BEARS;BEHAVIOR;POPULATION;MANAGEMENT;LANDSCAPE;PATTERNS;COYOTES;Humanities;Humanism;Humans,,

We studied patterns of space use by the black-footed ferret (Mustela nigripes), a prairie dog (Cynomys spp.) specialist, and the American badger (Taxidea taxus), a larger generalist carnivore that competes for prairie dogs and is known to kill ferrets. We expected that ferrets would spatially avoid badgers because of the risk of predation, that these patterns of avoidance might differ between sexes and age classes, and that the availability of food and space might influence these relationships. We used location data from 60 ferrets and 15 badgers to model the influence of extrinsic factors (prairie dog density and colony size) and intrinsic factors (sex, age) on patterns of space use by ferrets in relation to space use by different sex and age categories of badgers. We documented asymmetric patterns of avoidance of badgers by ferrets based on the sex of both species. Female ferrets avoided adult female badgers, but not male badgers, and male ferrets exhibited less avoidance than female ferrets. Additionally, avoidance decreased with increasing densities of prairie dogs. We suggest that intersexual differences in space use by badgers create varying distributions of predation risk that are perceived by the smaller carnivore (ferrets) and that females respond more sensitively than males to that risk. This work advances understanding about how competing species coexist and suggests that including information on both intrinsic and extrinsic factors might improve our understanding of behavioral interactions between sympatric species.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  21     Total Times Cited:  23     Cited Reference Count:  89 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1002/ece3.1561     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Coexistence;competition;foraging trade-offs;interspecific interactions;intraguild predation;intrasexual territoriality;BLACK-FOOTED FERRETS;RESOURCE SELECTION;HABITAT SELECTION;AMERICAN BADGERS;INTERFERENCE COMPETITION;CONATA BASIN;RED FOXES;COYOTES;RISK;BEHAVIOR;Prednisolone,,

To disentangle responses to several threats, we exposed two differently sized species of the freshwater invertebrate Daphnia to solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR) and predation from either moving pelagic or benthic ambush predators.        Using an advanced nanotechnology-based method, we tracked the three-dimensional movements of those mm-sized animals at the individual level. Each behavioural trial was performed both under conditions resembling night (no UVR) and day (UVR) and we examined patterns of the depth distribution and swimming speed by Daphnia across three treatments: no predator (control); bottom-dwelling damselfly (Calopteryx sp.); and fish (stickleback, Pungitius pungitius) predators. We also quantified the actual predation rate by the two predators on the two Daphnia species, Daphnia manga and Daphnia pulex.        We show that individual Daphnia are able to identify predators with different feeding habitats, rank multiple and simultaneously occurring risks and respond in accordance with the actual threat; complex responses that are generally associated with larger animals.

Processes""]",40,2,113-120,"Levin, LE",,English,,,"Kinetic dialogs are presented in this paper, which may help to decipher ambiguous stimuli during interactions of individuals that possess extremely antagonistic interests, such as predators and prey. Predators and prey tend not to be perceived by one another because natural selection penalizes any signal that announces their presence. Therefore, available signals for making adequate decisions may be scarce. I propose that within this impoverished signalization system the way each party reacts to a sudden movement of the other, strongly depends upon its own ongoing condition of motion immediately before the movement is perceived. The proposed signalization system is based on the temporal correlation of movements of the parties (contingency) and on sign (approach-withdrawal). If, after the animal moves, an object approaches, it should flee. But if the object withdraws, it should attack. I studied the behaviour of a fish (Brachydanio rerio) in response to a simple stimulus that approached or withdrew contingently with the fish movements. This was accomplished by means of a closed loop system in which the movements of the fish swimming in a glass tank were detected by a high-speed video camera connected to a computer. A real-time operating algorithm kept track of the movements of the fish. When movement was detected, a 4 mm clay ball was directed towards (predator program), or withdrawn from (prey program), the fish. Two different measurements of the 'antipredator' behaviour tested (i.e., frequency of turns after the stimulus and number of halts per stimulus) showed significantly higher values under the approaching condition than under the withdrawing condition. This differential reaction of the fish to two different values of the predator/prey variable suggests that specific predator/prey channels of communication are being manipulated with this method.

Changes in resource selection may allow individuals to offset climatic stress, thereby providing a mechanism for persistence amidst warming conditions. Whereas the role of predation risk in food choice has been studied broadly, the extent to which individuals respond to thermoregulatory risk by changing resource preferences is unclear. We addressed whether individuals compensated for temperature-related reductions in foraging time by altering forage preferences, using the American pika (Ochotona princeps) as a model species. We tested two hypotheses: (1) food-quality hypothesis-individuals exposed to temperature extremes should select higher-quality vegetation in return for accepting a physiologically riskier feeding situation; and (2) food-availability hypothesis-individuals exposed to temperature extremes should prioritize foraging quickly, thereby decreasing selection for higher-quality food. We quantified the composition and quality (% moisture, % nitrogen, and fiber content) of available and harvested vegetation, and deployed a network of temperature sensors to measure in situ conditions for 30 individuals, during July-Sept., 2015. Individuals exposed to more extreme daytime temperatures showed increased selection for high-nitrogen and for low-fiber vegetation, demonstrating strong support for the food-quality hypothesis. By contrast, pikas that experienced warmer conditions did not reduce selection for any of the three vegetation-quality metrics, as predicted by the food-availability hypothesis. By shifting resource-selection patterns, temperature-limited animals may be able to proximately buffer some of the negative effects associated with rapidly warming environments, provided that sufficient resources remain on the landscape.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  6     Total Times Cited:  6     Cited Reference Count:  94 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s00442-017-3993-2     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Thermoregulatory risk;Climate change;Forage choice;Resource selection;Ochotona princeps;PIKA OCHOTONA-PRINCEPS;AMERICAN PIKA;COLLARED PIKAS;FORAGING BEHAVIOR;GENERALIST HERBIVORE;PREDATION-RISK;SELECTION;NITROGEN;EVOLUTION;RESPONSES;Eating;Temperature,,

Mitigation of these deficiencies is essential for successful reintroduction programmes. Our study manipulated early developmental diet to better replicate foraging behaviour in the wild. Over 2years, we hand-reared 1800 pheasants (Phasianus colchicus), from 1day old, for 7weeks under different dietary conditions. In year one, 900 pheasants were divided into three groups and reared with (i) commercial chick crumb, (ii) crumb plus 1% live mealworm or (iii) crumb plus 5% mixed seed and fruit. In year two, a further 900 pheasants were divided into two groups and reared with (i) commercial chick crumb or (ii) crumb plus a combination of 1% mealworm and 5% mixed seed and fruit. In both years, the commercial chick crumb acted as a control treatment, whilst those with live prey and mixed seeds and fruits mimicking a more naturalistic diet. After 7weeks reared on these diets, pheasants were released into the wild. Postrelease survival was improved with exposure to more naturalistic diets prior to release. We identified four mechanisms to explain this. Pheasants reared with more naturalistic diets (i) foraged for less time and had a higher likelihood of performing vigilance behaviours, (ii) were quicker at handling live prey items, (iii) were less reliant on supplementary feed which could be withdrawn and (iv) developed different gut morphologies. These mechanisms allowed the pheasants to (i) reduce the risk of predation by reducing exposure time whilst foraging and allowing more time to be vigilant; (ii) be better at handling and discriminating natural food items and not be solely reliant on supplementary feed; and (iii) have a better gut system to cope with the natural forage after the cessation of supplementary feeding in the spring. Learning food discrimination, preference and handling skills by the provision of a more naturalistic diet is essential prior to the release of pheasants in a reintroduction programme. Subsequent diet, foraging behaviour, gut morphology and digestive capabilities all work together as one nutritional complex. Simple manipulations during early development can influence these characteristics to better prepare an individual for survival upon release.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  36     Total Times Cited:  37     Cited Reference Count:  76 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/1365-2656.12401     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),antipredator behaviour;conservation;diet;foraging;learning;Phasianus colchicus;pheasant;reintroduction;survival;RING-NECKED PHEASANTS;TIME BUDGETS;FITNESS CONSEQUENCES;PHASIANUS-COLCHICUS;BREEDING SUCCESS;PREDATION RISK;BODY CONDITION;GROUP-SIZE;BEHAVIOR;REINTRODUCTION,,

These intraguild interactions are key drivers of carnivore community structure, with ecosystem-wide cascading effects. Yet, behavioral mechanisms for coexistence of multiple carnivore species remain poorly understood. The challenges of studying large, free-ranging carnivores have resulted in mainly coarse-scale examination of behavioral strategies without information about all interacting competitors. We overcame some of these challenges by examining the concurrent fine-scale movement decisions of almost all individuals of four large mammalian carnivore species in a closed terrestrial system. We found that the intensity of intraguild interactions did not follow a simple hierarchical allometric pattern, because spatial and behavioral tactics of subordinate species changed with threat and resource levels across seasons. Lions (Panthera leo) were generally unrestricted and anchored themselves in areas rich in not only their principal prey, but also, during periods of resource limitation (dry season), rich in the main prey for other carnivores. Because of this, the greatest cost (potential intraguild predation) for subordinate carnivores was spatially coupled with the highest potential benefit of resource acquisition (prey-rich areas), especially in the dry season. Leopard (P. pardus) and cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) overlapped with the home range of lions but minimized their risk using fine-scaled avoidance behaviors and restricted resource acquisition tactics. The cost of intraguild competition was most apparent for cheetahs, especially during the wet season, as areas with energetically rewarding large prey (wildebeest) were avoided when they overlapped highly with the activity areas of lions. Contrary to expectation, the smallest species (African wild dog, Lycaon pictus) did not avoid only lions, but also used multiple tactics to minimize encountering all other competitors. Intraguild competition thus forced wild dogs into areas with the lowest resource availability year round. Coexistence of multiple carnivore species has typically been explained by dietary niche separation, but our multi-scaled movement results suggest that differences in resource acquisition may instead be a consequence of avoiding intraguild competition. We generate a more realistic representation of hierarchical behavioral interactions that may ultimately drive spatially explicit trophic structures of multi-predator communities.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  176     Total Times Cited:  177     Cited Reference Count:  66 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1890/13-0217.1     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),carnivore community;cost-benefit trade-off;interference competition;intraguild competition;Karongwe Game Reserve;South Africa;movement ecology;predator-prey interactions;top-down effects;HABITAT SELECTION;TOP PREDATORS;WILD DOGS;INTERSPECIFIC COMPETITION;PREY PREFERENCES;LIONS;DYNAMICS;SUCCESS;RESERVE,,

Mice mobilize and cache acorns to store them for winter consumption. They carry acorns away from potential competitors, face predation risks during mobilization, and cache acorns in areas where pilfering risks are low. However, mice can act either as net predators or as moderately efficient dispersers, depending on the way landscape management affects intraspecific competition for acorns and shelter availability. To assess the influence of landscape structure and mouse behavior on acorn dispersal, we developed an agent-based model (ABM) that translates forest management into changes in key environmental factors driving mouse foraging decisions.        The model was able to predict accurately acorn dispersal patterns in a wide range of forest management practices based on information on forest habitat availability, stem density and shrub cover. Sensitivity analysis revealed that caching rates emerged from the interplay between intraspecific competition for seeds and predation risk accepted during mobilization. It also showed that intraspecific competition for acorns decreased with increasing habitat loss (due to positive edge effects on acorn production) while landscape resistance to mouse movements increased. As a result, the net benefits of caching declined and acorn predation became the dominant strategy. Finally, we assessed the effects of shrub encroachment as a management practice to enhance dispersal services in savanna-like landscapes (dehesas). The model predicted non-linear responses with a 65% threshold of shrub cover needed to achieve relatively high levels of acorn dispersal. This value may not be compatible with the traditional exploitation of dehesas (livestock rearing). Our study shows that integrated approaches that combine environmental change driven by management with behavioral responses of dispersers improve our understanding of the causes of recruitment bottlenecks, and are useful tools for evaluating conservation strategies aimed at enhancing dispersal services.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  19     Total Times Cited:  19     Cited Reference Count:  69 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/oik.02884     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),MICE APODEMUS-SYLVATICUS;AGENT-BASED MODELS;SEED DISPERSAL;WOOD MICE;QUERCUS-ILEX;HOLM OAK;PREDATION RISK;PLANT-DISTRIBUTION;SPATIAL-PATTERNS;SIZE STRUCTURE;Rodentia;Trees,,

Fledgling birds offer a unique opportunity to investigate the 'blackmail theory', as their mobility enables them to influence the predation risk they face. We investigated a novel solicitation behaviour in fledgling pied babblers (Turdoides bicolor), where fledglings use their location to influence provisioning rates. We show that fledglings face a trade-off: the ground is a much more profitable location in terms of provisioning rate from adult carers, but they are at greater risk from predators owing to their limited flying ability and slow response to alarm calls. Young babbler fledglings move to the ground when hungry, signalling their state, and this stimulates adults to increase their provisioning rates. Once satiated, fledglings return to the safety of cover. By experimentally increasing terrestrial predation risk, we found that adults increased their provisioning rate to terrestrial but not arboreal fledglings. Thus, by moving to a riskier location, fledglings revealed their need and were able to manipulate adults to achieve higher provisioning rates. These results provide support for the 'blackmail theory'.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  11     Total Times Cited:  11     Cited Reference Count:  53 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1098/rspb.2013.0558     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),parent-offspring conflict;fledglings;predation risk;pied babbler;blackmail;location;PARENT-OFFSPRING CONFLICT;SWALLOWS TACHYCINETA-BICOLOR;BREEDING PIED BABBLERS;SENTINEL BEHAVIOR;COOPERATIVE BIRD;FOOD ALLOCATION;BEGGING SIGNALS;PREDATION RISK;ENERGETIC COST;ALARM CALLS,,

Most large carnivores are size dimorphic and offspring predation is often intraspecific and related to nonparental infanticide (NPI). NPI can be a foraging strategy, a strategy to reduce competition, or a male reproductive strategy. Spatiotemporal segregation is widespread among large carnivores, but its nature remains poorly understood. We evaluated three hypotheses to explain spatiotemporal segregation in the brown bear, a size-dimorphic large carnivore in which NPI is common; the NPI - foraging/competition hypothesis', i.e. NPI as a foraging strategy or a strategy to reduce competition, the NPI - sexual selection hypothesis', i.e. infanticide as a male reproductive strategy and the body size hypothesis', i.e. body-size-related differences in physiology, predation risk vulnerability or competitive ability causes spatiotemporal segregation. To test these hypotheses, we quantified spatiotemporal segregation among adult males, lone adult females and females with cubs-of-the-year, based on GPS-relocation data (2006-2010) and resource selection functions in a Scandinavian population. We found that spatiotemporal segregation was strongest between females with cubs-of-the-year and adult males during the mating season. During the mating season, females with cubs-of-the-year selected their resources, in contrast to adult males, in less rugged landscapes in relative close proximity to certain human-related variables, and in more open habitat types. After the mating season, females with cubs-of-the-year markedly shifted their resource selection towards a pattern more similar to that of their conspecifics. No strong spatiotemporal segregation was apparent between females with cubs-of-the-year and conspecifics during the mating and the postmating season. The NPI - sexual selection hypothesis' best explained spatiotemporal segregation in our study system. We suggest that females with cubs-of-the-year alter their resource selection to avoid infanticidal males. In species exhibiting NPI as a male reproductive strategy, female avoidance of infanticidal males is probably more common than observed or reported, and may come with a fitness cost if females trade safety for optimal resources.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  63     Total Times Cited:  64     Cited Reference Count:  75 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/1365-2656.12055     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),nonparental infanticide;reproductive strategy;resource selection;risk effects;risk factor;segregation;sexual selection;sexual size dimorphism;Ursus arctos;SEXUALLY SELECTED INFANTICIDE;ADULT MALE MORTALITY;HABITAT SELECTION;GRIZZLY BEARS;URSUS-ARCTOS;POSITIVE IMPACTS;RISK;BEHAVIOR;MASS;AVOIDANCE,,

Jumping spiders (Araneae: Salticidae) are characterized by their highly acute vision, which mediates many behaviors, including prey capture and navigation. When moving to a specific goal (prey, nest, a potential mate, etc.), salticids rely on visual cues and spatial memory to orient in 3-dimensional space. Salticid spatial ability has been studied in homing and detour tasks, with Portia being considered one of the most skillful genera in terms of spatial ability in the family. Commonly living in complex environments, salticids are likely to encounter a wide variety of routes that could lead to a goal, and, as selection favors individuals that can accurately make assessments, they may be able to assess alternative route distances to select the most efficient route. Here, we tested whether 2 salticid species (Portia fimbriata and Trite planiceps) can discriminate and assess between different available routes by their length, and riskiness to escape from a stressful scenario. Results suggest that while Portia is more likely to choose the easiest and shortest escape routes, Trite is faster in both decision making about which route to take, and to escape. However, some individuals were able to use novel shortcuts instead of the routes expected, with Portia containing a higher proportion of shortcut-takers than Trite. These differences in spatial ability seem to correspond with the environmental complexity inhabited by each species.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  8     Total Times Cited:  8     Cited Reference Count:  60 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1093/beheco/arz105     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),cognition;decision making;detour behavior;environmental complexity;route choice;salticid;CHEMICAL ALARM SIGNALS;PORTIA-FIMBRIATA;PREDATORY BEHAVIOR;TRITE-PLANICEPS;ROUTE SELECTION;LATERAL EYES;ARANEAE;SALTICIDAE;PREY;BEES;Risk Assessment,,

We investigated whether the fright reaction, a stereotypical avoidance response to olfactory cues from injured conspecifics, may be affected by reproductive status in a teleost fish, the crucian carp. We demonstrate that among individuals not responding to alarm substances with a fright reaction, the majority were ovulated or spermiated. In females, mean plasma concentrations of 17 beta-estradiol and testosterone, gonadal steroids known to decrease during the later stages of sexual maturation, were lower in the individuals not responding with a fright reaction compared to those responding. In males, there were no differences between responsive and non-responsive individuals in mean plasma levels of androgens (testosterone and 11-ketotestosterone) involved in spermatogenesis and male sexual behavior. As the fright reaction in crucian carp consists of behavior incompatible with spawning behavior, we hypothesize that this short-term suppression of the alarm response has evolved so that spawning can occur uninterrupted.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  18     Total Times Cited:  19     Cited Reference Count:  36 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s10886-008-9553-9     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Alarm substances;Crucian carp;Fright reaction;Olfaction;Ovulation;Pheromones;Reproduction;Risk taking;Sex hormones;Teleost fish;POECILIA-RETICULATA PISCES;MEDIAL OLFACTORY TRACT;ANTIPREDATOR RESPONSES;SPAWNING BEHAVIOR;ALARM SUBSTANCE;SEX-PHEROMONES;RISK;GOLDFISH;FISH;STICKLEBACK;Prednisolone,,

The net gain through either or both functions may vary with body size. Shell length measurements of Physa gyrina and P. heterostropha in the laboratory and P. heterostropha in the field revealed that successful mating generally involved smaller sperm donors and larger recipients. In contrast, attempts by larger snails to donate sperm were contested by smaller snails. These data suggest substantial plasticity in gender expression in accordance with a game-theoretic extension of Ghiselin's (1969, . Rev. Biol., 44, 189-208, 1974; The Economy of Nature and the Evolution of Sex) size-advantage model. Specifically, the larger of two interacting snails is more fecund, so the smaller snail has more to gain by donating sperm. This asymmetry creates a contest in which the smaller snail can afford to escalate the contest more and still profit, so long as escalation costs are not greater for the smaller snail. In the present study, the usual form of contest escalation was a visually obvious shell-swinging display, which attracts predators. Thus, the smaller of two contestants can use the risk of predation as a weapon in Contest escalations (i.e. a game of chicken), rather than using a purely physical contest that might favour the larger contestant.

Increased prevalence and spread of human schistosomiasis to non-endemic areas has been consistently linked with water resource management related to agricultural expansion. However, the role of agrochemical pollution in human schistosome transmission remains unexplored, despite strong evidence of agrochemicals increasing snail-borne diseases of wildlife and a projected 2-to 5-fold increase in global agrochemical use by 2050. Using a field mesocosm experiment, we show that environmentally relevant concentrations of fertilizer, a herbicide, and an insecticide, individually and as mixtures, increase densities of schistosome-infected snails by increasing the algae snails eat and decreasing densities of snail predators. Epidemiological models indicate that these agrochemical effects can increase transmission of schistosomes. Identifying agricultural practices or agrochemicals that minimize disease risk will be critical to meeting growing food demands while improving human wellbeing.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  42     Total Times Cited:  44     Cited Reference Count:  60 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1038/s41467-018-03189-w     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),CRAYFISH PROCAMBARUS-CLARKII;PRAWN MACROBRACHIUM-ROSENBERGII;LABORATORY POPULATIONS;TREMATOCRANUS-PLACODON;BULINUS-NYASSANUS;BIOMPHALARIA;PREDATION;SNAILS;CONSTRUCTION;TRANSMISSION;Humanities;Humanism;Humans;Schistosomiasis,,

We then analyze population level and coexistence probability given node-centrality measures that characterize specific patches. We show that both predator and prey species benefit from living in globally well-connected patches (i.e. with high closeness centrality). However, the maximum number of prey species is reached, on average, at lower closeness centrality levels than for predator species. Hence, prey species benefit from constraints imposed on species movement in fragmented landscapes since they can reproduce with a lesser risk of predation, and their need for using anti-predatory strategies decreases.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  32     Total Times Cited:  34     Cited Reference Count:  52 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s10980-010-9493-y     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Networks;Landscape;Predator-prey;Coexistence;Survival probabilities;ABM;IBM;INDIVIDUAL-BASED MODELS;HABITAT FRAGMENTATION;COMPLEX NETWORKS;GRAPH-THEORY;DIFFUSION;BEHAVIOR;ENVIRONMENTS;PERSISTENCE;PATCHINESS;STABILITY;Prednisolone;Population Dynamics,,

Yet whether and to what degree harvesting modifies the collective behavior of exploited species are largely unknown. We present a multigeneration harvest selection experiment with zebrafish, Danio rerio, as a model species to understand the effects of size-selective harvesting on shoaling behavior. The experimental system is based on a large-harvested (typical of most wild-capture fisheries targeting larger size classes) and small-harvested (typical of specialized fisheries and gape-limited predators targeting smaller size classes) selection lines. By combining high-resolution tracking of fish behavior with computational agent-based modeling, we show that shoal cohesion changed in the direction expected by a trade-off between individual vigilance and the use of social cues. In particular, we document a decrease of individual vigilance in the small-harvested line, which was linked to an increase in the attention to social cues, favoring more cohesive shoals. Opposing outcomes were found for the large-harvested line, which formed less cohesive shoals. Using the agent-based model, we outline possible consequences of changes in shoaling behavior for both fishing and natural mortality. The changes in shoaling induced by large size-selective harvesting may decrease fishing mortality but increase mortality by natural predators. Our work suggests an insofar overlooked evolutionary mechanism by which size-selective harvesting can affect fishing and natural mortality of exploited fish.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  1     Total Times Cited:  1     Cited Reference Count:  84 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1086/718591     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),boldness;cohesion;collective;vigilance;fisheries;predation;COLLECTIVE BEHAVIOR;PREDATION RISK;LIFE-HISTORY;ZEBRAFISH;VIGILANCE;ECOLOGY;SCHOOLS;RESCUE;ODDITY;PREY,,

This seemingly paradoxical behavior, known as predator inspection, has been reported for a wide variety of taxa-and therefore can be assumed to be adaptive. However, the view of predator inspection as a paradoxical behavior rests on two implicit assumptions: (a) initial predator detection is unambiguous, with no uncertainty in discriminating between hunting and non-hunting members of predator species, or members of predator species and unrelated phenomena; (b) the costs of flight are negligible relative to the risks of predation. Upon reflection assumption (a) is not really tenable. Whereas assumption (b) is not consistent with experimental evidence [Godin & Crossman (1994) Behav. Ecol. Sociobiol. 34, 359-366.]. Given that predator detection is ambiguous and the costs of flight are not negligible, a prey individual may benefit by a closer approach to the source of the alarming signals, thus improving its assessment of the situation-despite the increased risk of predation. In this paper, the above statement is given rigor by reformulating the problem in game theoretical terms. The results indicate that a prey will minimize its costs by performing predator inspection whenever its degree of certainty regarding predator identification and/or assessment of its intentions is less than a threshold, which is determined by the model's parameters.

In particular, predation has been implicated as a major force affecting female sexual preferences, male mating tactics and the level of sperm competition. When predation is high, females typically reduce their preferences for showy males and engage more in antipredator behaviours, whereas males exploit these changes by switching from sexual displays to forced matings. These patterns are thought to account for the relatively high levels of multiple paternity in high-predation populations compared to low-predation populations. Here, we assess the possible evolutionary consequences of these patterns by asking whether variation in sperm traits reflect differences in predation intensity among four pairs of Trinidadian populations: four that experience relatively low levels of predation from a gape-limited predator and four that experience relatively high levels of predation from a variety of piscivores. We found that males in high-predation populations had faster swimming sperm with longer midpieces compared to males in low-predation populations. However, we found no differences among males in high- and low-predation populations with respect to sperm number, sperm head length, flagellum length and total sperm length.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  21     Total Times Cited:  22     Cited Reference Count:  65 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/j.1420-9101.2010.01996.x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),cryptic female choice;polyandry;promiscuity;sexual selection;sperm competition;POECILIA-RETICULATA;EXTRAPAIR PATERNITY;COMPETITION GAMES;ATLANTIC SALMON;MATE CHOICE;TRADE-OFF;QUALITY;COURTSHIP;BEHAVIOR;REPRODUCTION;Paternalism;Paternity;Prednisolone,,

Balancing these factors becomes more complicated when prey are threatened by more than one type of predator. Hence, the ability to recognize species-specific predator odours and prioritize behaviours according to the level of risk is essential for survival. We investigated how rock rats, Zyzomys spp. modify their foraging behaviour and giving-up density (GUD) in the presence of an apex predator, the dingo Canis dingo, a mesopredator, the northern quoll Dasyurus hallucatus, a herbivore, the rock wallaby Petrogale brachyotis as a pungency control and water as a procedural control. Both dingoes and quolls consume rock rats, but because quolls can enter small crevices inhabited by rock rats, they pose a greater threat to rock rats than dingoes. Rock rats demonstrated a stronger avoidance to quoll odour than dingo odour, and no avoidance of the pungency control (rock wallaby) and the procedural control (water). GUD values declined significantly over the duration of the study, but did not differ between odour treatments.

Therefore, any change in the behavior of the predator should result in changes to the behavior of the prey. However, this key prediction has rarely been tested. To examine the effects of the predator state on prey behavior, we manipulated the state of captive Barn Owls, Tyto alba, and released them into an enclosure containing Allenby's gerbils, Gerbillus andersoni allenbyi, a common prey of the owls. The owls were significantly more active when hungry. In response, the gerbils altered their behavior according to the state of the owl. When the owl was hungry, the gerbils visited fewer food patches, foraged in fewer patches, and harvested less food from each patch. Moreover, the gerbils kept their foraging bouts closer to their burrow, which reduced the overlap among foraging ranges of individual gerbils. Thus, changes in the state of the predator affect the foraging behavior of its prey and can also mediate competition among prey individuals.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  29     Total Times Cited:  29     Cited Reference Count:  45 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1890/09-0112.1     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Allenby's gerbils;Barn Owls;foraging;Gerbillus andersoni allenbyi;giving-up density;patch use;predator-prey interactions;predalor state;Tyto alba;PATCH USE;HABITAT SELECTION;FORAGING BEHAVIOR;RISK-ASSESSMENT;PREY;APPREHENSION;AVOIDANCE;COLEOPTERA;VIGILANCE;RESPONSES;Gerbillinae;Emergencies;Prednisolone,,

The term 'boldness' describes individual variation in the propensity to exhibit risk-reducing behavior and is the subject of much research attention. Predators should select against boldness, and this has been supported by empirical studies and behavioral ecology theory. We tested whether a standardized assay of three boldness-associated behaviors in wood frog (Lithobates sylvaticus) tadpoles predicted survival when faced with a predator. Tadpole behavior was assayed in an open field and then tadpoles were placed, in pairs, in an enclosure with a predator (newt or larval dragonfly). Survival did not depend on differences in measured boldness, and this result held when we accounted for interactions between different boldness behaviors and between behavior and size or predator identity. The absence of selection by predators against bolder tadpoles is counterintuitive and inconsistent with our understanding of the behavioral ecology of these animals. Two possible explanations are offered for this result. First, selection against boldness may be minimized by other phenotypic traits, such as escape ability. Alternatively, the potential lack of consistency between standardized boldness assays and natural encounters with predators may limit our capacity to study the evolution of boldness, cautioning against this approach. These results highlight the complexities of the relationships between behavioral traits and fitness and the challenges associated with their study.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  12     Total Times Cited:  12     Cited Reference Count:  72 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1163/1568539X-00003121     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),anti-predator behavior;boldness;Lithobates sylvaticus;natural selection;predation;Rana sylvatica;tadpoles;ANTIPREDATOR BEHAVIOR;NATURAL-SELECTION;RISK;RESPONSES;CONSEQUENCES;TEMPERAMENT;MORTALITY;PREY;PERSONALITY;PERFORMANCE;Prednisolone,,

In this study we evaluated the effects of an early stressful experience (i.e. a rough visual and acoustical contact with humans) on the antipredatory reactions of adult Rock partridges. During the 1st week after hatching, one group of Rock partridges was exposed to repeated human intrusions into its aviary, and another undisturbed group served as control. Five months later, we observed that the escape reaction to an approaching human was elicited at greater distances in the experimental group than in the control one. On the other hand, the repeated disturbance by a human did not affect the reactions to raptor and fox dummies, which were however appropriate to the predator. In the Rock partridge the effect of this early aversive interaction was thus stimulus-specific, increasing defensive response only to the predator they experienced, although avoidance behaviour was not generalized to further common predators of these game-birds. This study stresses the importance, in farm reared birds, of the early experience of specific aversive stimuli to develop long-term appropriate responses to predators, and thus to increase the probability of survival after release in nature.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  18     Total Times Cited:  19     Cited Reference Count:  37 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",,predation;vigilance;antipredator behaviour;early experience;handrearing;rock partridge;PREDATOR-RECOGNITION;VISUAL CONTACT;GREY PARTRIDGE;JAPANESE-QUAIL;GALLUS-GALLUS;FEAR;RESPONSES;SURVIVAL;CHICKENS;PERDIX;Humanities;Humanism;Humans,,

Habitat fragmentation operates on spatial scales ranging over several magnitudes from patches to landscapes. We focus on small-scale fragmentation effects relevant to animal foraging decision making that could ultimately generate distribution patterns. In a controlled experimental environment, we tested small-scale fragmentation effects in artificial sea grass on the feeding behaviour of juvenile cod (Gadus morhua). Moreover, we examined the influence of fragmentation on the distribution of one of the juvenile cod's main prey resources, the grass shrimp (Palaemon elegans), in association with three levels of risk provided by cod (no cod, cod chemical cues and actively foraging cod). Time spent by cod within sea grass was lower in fragmented landscapes, but total shrimp consumption was not affected. Shrimp utilised vegetation to a greater extent in fragmented treatments in combination with active predation. We suggest that shrimp choose between sand and vegetation habitats to minimize risk of predation according to cod habitat-specific foraging capacities, while cod aim to maximize prey-dependent foraging rates, generating a habitat-choice game between predator and prey. Moreover, aggregating behaviour in grass shrimp was only found in treatments with active predation. Hence, we argue that both aggregation and vegetation use are anti-predator defence strategies applied by shrimp. We therefore stress the importance of considering small-scale behavioural mechanisms when evaluating consequences from habitat fragmentation on trophic processes in coastal environments.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  4     Total Times Cited:  4     Cited Reference Count:  43 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s00227-012-2122-3     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),TROPHIC CASCADES;ZOSTERA-MARINA;PATCH SIZE;COD;RISK;CONFIGURATION;LANDSCAPES;BEHAVIOR;BIRDS;FISH;Poaceae;Prednisolone,,

They all use flagella to swim and to generate feeding currents to encounter prey and enhance nutrient uptake. At the same time, the beating flagella create flow disturbances that attract flow-sensing predators. Protists have highly diverse flagellar arrangements in terms of number of flagella and their position, beat pattern, and kinematics, but it is unclear how the various arrangements optimize the fundamental trade-off between resource acquisition and predation risk. Here we describe the near-cell flow fields produced by 15 species and demonstrate consistent relationships between flagellar arrangement and swimming speed and between flagellar arrangement and flow architecture, and a trade-off between resource acquisition and predation risk. The flow fields fall in categories that are qualitatively described by simple point force models that include the drag force of the moving cell body and the propulsive forces of the flagella. The trade-off between resource acquisition and predation risk varies characteristically between flow architectures: Flagellates with multiple flagella have higher predation risk relative to their clearance rate compared to species with only one active flagellum, with the exception of the highly successful dinoflagellates that have simultaneously achieved high clearance rates and stealth behavior due to a unique flagellar arrangement. Microbial communities are shaped by trade-offs and environmental constraints, and a mechanistic explanation of foraging trade-offs is a vital part of understanding the eukaryotic communities that form the basis of pelagic food webs.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  2     Total Times Cited:  2     Cited Reference Count:  62 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1073/pnas.2009930118     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),clearance rate;predation risk;flow disturbance;point force models;FEEDING CURRENTS;CALANOID COPEPODS;NUTRIENT-UPTAKE;MECHANISMS;ORGANISMS;BEHAVIOR;PREDATOR;GROWTH;CONSTRAINTS;COMPETITION,,

Understanding of how group size, traits of individuals within groups, food abundance, and predation risk simultaneously influence helping behavior is limited. We evaluated pup-guarding behavior in gray wolves (Canis lupus) to assess how differences in individuals, groups, and environment affect helping behavior. We used data from 92 GPS-collared wolves in North America (2001-2012) to estimate individual pup-guarding rates. Individuals in groups with low helper-to-pup ratios spent more time guarding young than those in groups with more helpers, an indication of load-lightening. Female helpers guarded more than male helpers, but this relationship weakened as pups grew. Subset analyses including data on helper age and wolf and prey density showed such factors did not significantly influence pup-guarding rates. We show that characteristics of individuals and groups have strong influences on pup-guarding behavior in gray wolves, but environmental factors such as food abundance and predation risk from conspecifics were not influential.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  13     Total Times Cited:  13     Cited Reference Count:  63 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/eth.12566     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Canis lupus;cooperative breeding;groups;helping;pup-guarding;wolves;DOG LYCAON-PICTUS;AFRICAN WILD DOG;GRAY WOLF;PACK SIZE;RENDEZVOUS SITES;CANIS-LUPUS;URSUS-ARCTOS;PUP SURVIVAL;WOLVES;EVOLUTION;Social Behavior,,

We used controlled indoor experiments to investigate the ability of red knots to discern between high- and low-threat encounters with a representative predator, the sparrowhawk. The behaviour of knots was compared across three conditions: no predators present (very low predation threat), presentation of a perching sparrowhawk model (low predation threat) and presentation of a gliding sparrowhawk model (high predation threat). In all behavioural parameters measured, red knots showed evidence of discriminating between the different levels of predation risk. Knots responded immediately to the presence of sparrowhawks with escape flights, and the duration of escape flights was longer following the gliding sparrowhawk events than following perching events. Similarly, the proportion of time spent vigilant increased with increasing level of predation threat, while the proportion of time spent feeding decreased. These results show that knots recognize variations in the level of predation threat, and adjust their antipredator responses accordingly. Furthermore, model sparrowhawks were introduced into the experimental arena at similar distances to the knots, which suggests that knots are able to use cues other than distance to predator to gauge the immediate level of threat that a predator poses.

When aggressive, physically dominant species are displaced by anthropogenic disturbance, physically weaker species exploit competitor and predator downtimes to forage in previously risky places. Birds feeding at outdoor restaurants and cafes in association with humans are exposed to fluctuating levels of perceived danger caused by frequently changing densities of human diners. Consequently, birds must make decisions about which dining tables to visit based on trade-offs between foraging gain and perceived danger from avian competitors and humans. We tested the hypothesis that interspecific differences in response to perceived danger, combined with varying densities of human diners, dynamically alter which bird species predominates at dining tables. We found that house sparrows (Passer domesticus) tolerated higher human diner-densities than larger-sized, more physically dominant Eurasian jackdaws (Coloeus monedula). Sparrows were usually the first birds to visit diner-occupied tables and spent more time there than jackdaws. However, at diner-abandoned tables, this pattern changed: During low diner-densities at surrounding tables, jackdaws were usually the predominant species in first visits and minutes spent visiting, while at high diner-densities sparrows usually predominated. Moreover, along a gradient of increasing human diner-density, sparrows gradually replaced jackdaws as the predominant species in first visits and time at abandoned tables. However, at diner-occupied tables, once a sparrow chose which table to visit, factors other than diner-density influenced its choice of where to forage there (table-top or ground). To our knowledge, our research is the first scientific study of table-visiting behavior by birds at outdoor restaurants and cafes, and the first to reveal interspecific differences in table-visiting behavior by birds there.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  2     Total Times Cited:  2     Cited Reference Count:  47 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/eth.13145     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),anthropogenic disturbance;behavior and ecosystem services;feeding associations;human ecology;temporal interactions;urban ecology;FLIGHT INITIATION DISTANCE;PREDATION RISK;FEAR;LANDSCAPE;PREY;URBAN;ECOLOGY;IMPACTS;LIONS;ANTS,,

The harsh environment provides a short breeding season where the sunlit summer nights provide little reprieve from visibility to predators and increased risk. In this paper, we tested the activity and food choice patterns of bank voles Myodes glareolus in early spring season, categorized by 18h of daylight and 6h of dusk in every day cycle. We found that territorial females showed a less predictable pattern of activity than males that were most active during the hours of dusk. The voles also showed preference to forage on high carbohydrate foods at sunset, while switching over to a more protein and fat-based diet towards sunrise. This shift is suggestive of a diet that is a direct adaptation to day-long fasts. Our results suggest a sensitive mechanism between food choice and predator avoidance in a system where light summer nights increase the predation risk considerably.Significance statementBank voles, Myodes glareolus, are considered a model organism in ecological studies and have been used for studies of population cycles, predator-prey interactions and studies of territoriality with over a century of published records. In this study, we challenge two major preconceptions about these animals using behavioral bio-assays in a controlled environment. (1) We challenge the diurnal activity patterns of these rodents currently accepted to have a bi-modal distribution in summer months and show a unimodular activity pattern. And (2) we show that these animals are not opportunistic foragers but vary their diet to compensate for the stress of an extended daytime fast further supporting a nocturnal pattern of activity even in extreme sunlit nights where night lasts under an hour.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  4     Total Times Cited:  4     Cited Reference Count:  57 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s00265-019-2703-y     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Foraging ecology;Subarctic forests;Vole-weasel model system;Sex bias and social behaviour;Evolutionary game theory;Physiological energetics;VOLES CLETHRIONOMYS-GLAREOLUS;BANK VOLES;PREDATION RISK;PATCH USE;HABITAT SELECTION;SPACING BEHAVIOR;FIELD VOLES;POPULATION;WEASELS;STRESS;Food,,

Interactions between humans and hunted species can lead to behavioral shifts in the animal that affect hunter satisfaction and possibly fitness of the animals. We assessed the influence of multiple factors that may affect anti-predator behavior in a commonly harvested game bird, the northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus), during October 2013-March 2015 on a private plantation in South Carolina, USA. We monitored bobwhite-hunter interactions during hunting events (n=40) using radio-telemetry and behavioral observations. We investigated bobwhite anti-predator behavior in 2 contexts, choice of evasive tactic and timing of tactic deployment (i.e., level of wariness), using a combination of linear regression and multinomial models in a Bayesian framework. Our results indicate the approach style of the hunter (i.e., pointing dog) and vegetation density affect the evasive tactic used. Dense vegetation at 0.6m above ground height promoted hiding behavior of bobwhites, whereas approaching pointing dogs (i.e., not holding point) promoted flushing. Also, dense vegetation at 0.3m above ground height and previous exposure to a discharged firearm elicited an earlier anti-predator response. Our results imply that bobwhites make context-specific decisions regarding hunter evasion, which may be a result of associative learning. Managers may be able to increase bobwhite-hunter encounters and improve hunter satisfaction by maintaining vegetation structure between 0.6 and 1.3m to promote hiding behavior throughout the hunting season. (c) 2018 The Wildlife Society.        During hunter interactions, bobwhites held more frequently in dense vegetation 0.6m above ground height, flushed more often when encountered by moving pointing dogs, and exhibited learning behaviors from previous exposure to hunters. Proper vegetation management to provide the optimal structure while minimizing dense vegetation (i.e., mat forming grasses) at the ground level will foster increased opportunities to detect coveys and improve hunter satisfaction.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  1     Total Times Cited:  1     Cited Reference Count:  70 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1002/jwmg.21441     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),anthropogenic disturbance;anti-predator behavior;Colinus virginianus;escape behavior;hunting pressure;pointing dog;response distance;vegetation structure;ANTIPREDATOR BEHAVIOR;HABITAT STRUCTURE;FARMLAND BIRDS;VIGILANCE BEHAVIOR;FOOD AVAILABILITY;MODEL SELECTION;ESCAPE BEHAVIOR;RISK;MANAGEMENT;AVOIDANCE;Prednisolone,,

We examined group-choice decisions by individuals in armored and nonarmored species and predicted that either (1) the oddity effect would result in preference for conspecific groups for solitary individuals of both species, or (2) individuals in the armored species would prefer to associate with groups containing individuals of the more vulnerable species. Armored brook sticklebacks (Culaea inconstans) and nonarmored fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) have the same predators and often occur together in streams. In mixed-species shoals, yellow perch (Perca flavescens) attacked minnows earlier and more often than sticklebacks. We tested whether solitary minnows and sticklebacks preferred to associate with conspecific or heterospecific shoals under conditions of both low and high predation risk. When predation risk was high, minnows preferred to associate with conspecifics over heterospecifics, as predicted by the oddity effect. In contrast, sticklebacks preferentially associated with groups of minnows over groups of conspecifics when predation risk was high. When predation risk was low, solitary individuals of both species preferentially associated with conspecific over heterospecific shoals. Stickleback shoal choices under low-risk conditions may have been influenced by interspecific competition for food. In feeding experiments, minnows were more efficient foragers than sticklebacks, so it should benefit sticklebacks to avoid minnows unless predation risk is high. Therefore, for armored prey, the benefits of associating with more vulnerable prey appear to override the costs of both the oddity effect and food competition when predation risk is high.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  40     Total Times Cited:  43     Cited Reference Count:  39 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1093/beheco/14.3.334     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),armor;Culaea inconstans;fathead minnows;mixed-species aggregations;oddity effect;Pimephales promelas;predation risk;sticklebacks;FATHEAD MINNOWS;PREDATION RISK;NORTHERN PIKE;PIMEPHALES-PROMELAS;FISH SHOALS;ESOX-LUCIUS;SIZE;BEHAVIOR;STICKLEBACKS;COMPETITION,,

Group foraging is generally considered as a strategy for optimizing this trade-off. Previous modelling studies assumed that group sizes were static and that all group members are informed of an imminent predator attack if one of them detects it. These models implicitly assumed that birds could estimate group size, and adopt a fixed rate of anti-predator vigilance scanning. Recent empirical results suggest that group sizes are generally dynamic rather than static and the group members are often unaware of another's detection of imminent attack. It has also been observed that vigilance rates are not static but change after the arrival or departure of another. Here, we present a model which allows feeding-group size (and individuals' vigilance rates) to vary dynamically, and investigate the implications which this has for the optimum trade-off between foraging and avoiding predation. We find that newly arrived birds should generally be the most vigilant and that vigilance rates should decrease after the arrival of another into the feeding group but increase after a departure. Vigilance rates should increase as the cost of predator attack increases or if the reward rate from foraging decreases. Vigilance should increase if predator attacks are more common but decrease if predators require a longer time undetected to approach the feeding group. In common with many experimental studies, we observe that vigilance rates decrease as the average number of birds feeding together increases. Hence, the main conclusion of previous works (that foraging in groups is an effective strategy for balancing the conflicting pressures of foraging and avoiding predation) is obtained by our model, despite relaxing several previously used assumptions. Finally, we discuss some of the open questions related to group vigilance and how extensions to our modelling framework might be used to address these.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  6     Total Times Cited:  6     Cited Reference Count:  18 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Maybe""}",,co-operation;flocking;foraging;game theory;predation;strategy;GROUP-SIZE;ANTIPREDATORY VIGILANCE;PREDATION;BEHAVIOR,,

Here, we use analytical and computational models to show that, in numerous biological scenarios, the standard results of signal detection theory do not apply; more predators can result in prey being less responsive to such cues. The standard results need not apply when the probability of danger pertains not just to the present, but also to future decisions. We identify how responses to risk should depend on background mortality and autocorrelation, and that predictions in relation to animal welfare can also be reversed from the standard theory.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  18     Total Times Cited:  18     Cited Reference Count:  33 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1098/rspb.2017.1852     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),behaviour;evolution;state-dependence;signal detection theory;error management theory;risk allocation;ANTIPREDATOR BEHAVIOR;NATURAL-SELECTION;ERROR MANAGEMENT;AFFECTIVE STATE;PREDATION RISK;ALLOCATION;ENVIRONMENT;PRINCIPLE;EVOLUTION;RESPONSES,,

Empirical assessments have shown that the functional and numerical responses of predators to human disturbances are variable, yet spatial changes in predation risk by two predators have seldom been studied for prey occurring in human-modified landscapes. Using the boreal caribou Rangifer tarandus caribou - grey wolf Canis lupus - black bear Ursus americanus system in eastern Canada, we investigated whether responses of prey towards one predator could concomitantly increase risk of predation from another predator exhibiting a different foraging tactic. We investigated trade-offs made by solitary caribou females and mothers accompanied by their calf during the period of highest calf vulnerability and compared the behaviour of mothers that would eventually lose their calf to predation to that of mothers whose calf survived until the following year. We modelled habitat selection using different metrics of forage based on field measurements and digital maps and developed empirical models of predation risk and prey behaviour using GPS data collected on both predators and prey. Mothers accompanied by their calf seemed to compromise foraging opportunities for safety, as opposed to solitary females who showed no particular avoidance of areas used by predators. Although caribou mothers adopted selection strategies that could have protected their offspring from wolves, females that eventually lost their calf to predation selected for vegetative associations that were favourable to bears.Synthesis and applications. We determined that mothers that most strongly avoided suitable wolf habitat were also those that most strongly selected suitable bear habitat, suggesting that by using antipredator strategies aimed at reducing predation risk from wolves, caribou exposed their offspring to increased predation risk from bears. This result is of paramount conservation value as bears were responsible for 94% of caribou calf kills in this system. In the short term, conservation efforts for boreal caribou may benefit from the management of bear populations by means of liberal hunting regulations or predator control. In the long term, however, these actions should be used in conjunction with the protection of potential calving areas away from cutblocks and roads.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  28     Total Times Cited:  28     Cited Reference Count:  56 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/1365-2664.12658     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),antipredator strategies;Canis lupus;habitat selection;predation risk;predator facilitation;predator-prey interactions;Rangifer tarandus caribou;reproductive success;survival;Ursus americanus;RESOURCE SELECTION FUNCTIONS;FOREST-DWELLING CARIBOU;HABITAT SELECTION;WOODLAND CARIBOU;BLACK BEARS;RANGIFER-TARANDUS;BOREAL FOREST;NORTHEASTERN ALBERTA;URSUS-AMERICANUS;LARGE HERBIVORES;Prednisolone,,

The basic premise of updating one's state according to some underlying motivation is well suited to the realm of reservoir computing; however, entire swarms of individuals are yet to be tasked with learning movement in this framework. This work focuses on the specific case of many selfish individuals simultaneously optimizing their domains in a manner conducive to reducing their personal risk of predation. Using an echo state network and data generated from the agent-based model, we show that, with an appropriate representation of input and output states, this selfish movement can be learned. This suggests that a more sophisticated neural network, such as a brain, could also learn this behavior and provides an avenue to further the search for realistic movement rules in systems of autonomous individuals.

However, post-contest signals, such as victory displays, have received relatively little attention. One hypothesised function of victory displays is to ensure a more lasting dominance by reducing the risk of losers re-initiating a new contest with winners. Despite several theoretical studies using game theory that support this hypothesis, empirical support for the understanding of when and why victory displays are used with respect to browbeating is lacking. We use a common South-East Asian mangrove crab, Perisesarma eumolpe, to examine whether the performance of victory displays by winners, among other factors, affects the time of fight re-initiation by losers, if at all re-initiated. Using mixed-effects survival analysis models, we analysed 77 fights from 27 staged contest trials between randomly paired males. We found losers that experienced victory display performed by winners, presented a decreased instantaneous hazard rate of re-initiating a new fight than losers that did not. These results corroborate previous game theoretical models indicating that victory displays may function to reduce the chances of losers re-initiating another fight. In discouraging losers from restarting a fight, winners reduce the potential costs of a future contest.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  7     Total Times Cited:  7     Cited Reference Count:  40 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/eth.12696     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),contest;fighting;Perisesarma eumolpe;post-contest display;signal;PREDATION RISK;BEHAVIOR;CRICKET;MOTIVATION;CONTESTS,,

We examined the effect of moonlight on the foraging activity and capture success of the federally endangered giant kangaroo rat (Dipodomys ingens) in the Carrizo Plain National Monument, California. D. ingens is adapted to open grasslands, a habitat type where moonlight should strongly influence its visibility to predators. Using a trapping data set of 11,353 captures from 2007 to 2009 and accounting for factors such as cloud cover, temperature, abundance of the San Joaquin kit fox (Vulpes macrotis mutica), plant biomass, trap acclimation, and trap effort, we found a consistently positive effect of moonlight on capture success. In foraging trials we detected no effect of moonlight on giving-up densities or time spent at seed piles. Our results suggest that giant kangaroo rats do not perceive a higher risk of predation in bright moonlight. Nocturnal rodents that rely on early visual detection of predators might benefit from moonlight as much as their predators do, thus resulting in no net change in predation risk.

In this study, we investigated whether there is a trade-off between intraspecific communication through scent marking and the risk of alerting prey in a wild population of a stalking predator, the Eurasian lynx. We followed lynx tracks in the snow and recorded scent marks and evidence of hunting behaviour along these tracks. Lynx preferred conspicuous objects for marking and increased scent marking rate when walking along linear structures, such as forest roads. This association was strongest when lynx were hunting, while there was only a weak correlation when no evidence of hunting could be detected. On tracks with evidence of hunting behaviour, lynx engaged less in scent marking. The relationship was most evident during the mating season, when lynx increased scent marking rates while they were not hunting. We further expected lynx to mark most in areas where they had recently hunted successfully, but time and distance to the last kill were not associated with scent marking rate. Our study supports the hypothesis that lynx face a trade-off between enhancing the detection probability of scent marks by conspecifics and avoiding eavesdropping by prey, and indicates that scent marking rate is influenced by several factors.

Using an information-theoretic approach, we assessed predictions of four hypotheses relating to causes and consequences of breeding dispersal in a migratory passerine, the red-backed shrike Lanius collurio. As predicted by the reproductive performance hypothesis, probability of breeding dispersal in females (though not in males) decreased with increasing annual average number of fledglings produced in the past year, but there was no association with conspecific reproductive performance in either sex. The site choice hypothesis, stating that individuals disperse to improve breeding site quality, received support in males only, as dispersal probability was positively associated to a measure indicating low territory quality. The social constraints hypothesis, referring to dispersal in relation to intraspecific interactions, received little support in either sex. The predation risk hypothesis was hardly supported either. Consequences of dispersal were marginal in both sexes because neither fledgling production in females, nor territory quality in males improved after dispersal. In addition, males settled on territories closer to the forest edge than those occupied predispersal, which is opposite to the prediction of the predation risk hypothesis. We conclude that own reproductive success was the major factor determining dispersal behavior in females, whereas territory quality and possibly predation risk were most important in males.

There is no evidence that predatory rotifers orient to their prey from a distance. As a result, the encounter rate between predators and prey is heavily dependent upon the swimming speed of each species. Thus, rotifers may alter their probability of encountering predators by reducing their swimming speed. However, this predator defense mechanism of the rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus is reversed by sublethal exposure to the toxicant pentachlorophenol. Swimming speed of B. calyciflorus was tested with the combined stresses of predation by Asplanchna girodi and sublethal concentrations of pentachlorophenol. A mathematical model was then developed to assess the effects of changes in B. calyciflorus swimming behavior on its predation risk. A significant interaction was found between the presence of the predator and pentachlorophenol on B. calyciflorus swimming speeds. In the absence of toxicant, B. calyciflorus swam up to 20% slower in the presence of the predator, indicating a predation defense mechanism capable of reducing encounter rates. However, sublethal pentachlorophenol exposure caused a 30% increase in swimming speed, resulting in an increase in predation risk of up to 50%. These results indicate that sublethal pentachlorophenol toxicity may adversely affect the ability of B. calyciflorus to avoid predation, thereby reducing its fitness. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

These can alter animal movement and space use and affect the intensity of interactions among species, including predation and competition. Effects of linear features on animal movement have seen relatively little research in avian systems, despite ample evidence of their effects in mammalian systems and that some types of linear features, including both roads and transmission lines, are substantial sources of mortality. Here, we used satellite telemetry combined with step selection functions designed to explicitly incorporate the energy landscape (el-SSFs) to investigate the effects of linear features and habitat on movements and space use of a large soaring bird, the golden eagleAquila chrysaetos, during migration. Our sample consisted of 32 adult eagles tracked for 45 spring and 39 fall migrations from 2014 to 2017. Fitted el-SSFs indicated eagles had a strong general preference for south-facing slopes, where thermal uplift develops predictably, and that these areas are likely important aspects of migratory pathways. el-SSFs also provided evidence that roads and railroads affected movement during both spring and fall migrations, but eagles selected areas near roads to a greater degree in spring compared to fall and at higher latitudes compared to lower latitudes. During spring, time spent near linear features often occurred during slower-paced or stopover movements, perhaps in part to access carrion produced by vehicle collisions. Regardless of the behavioural mechanism of selection, use of these features could expose eagles and other soaring species to elevated risk via collision with vehicles and/or transmission lines. Linear features have previously been documented to affect the ecology of terrestrial species (e.g. large mammals) by modifying individuals' movement patterns; our work shows that these effects on movement extend to avian taxa.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  3     Total Times Cited:  3     Cited Reference Count:  114 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/1365-2656.13335     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Bayesian;continuous time movement model;correlated random walk;golden eagle;habitat selection;movement ecology;resource selection;space use;EAGLES AQUILA-CHRYSAETOS;RESOURCE SELECTION;ANIMAL MOVEMENT;GOLDEN EAGLES;WOODLAND CARIBOU;MIGRATORY BIRDS;TRADE-OFFS;ROADS;HABITAT;WOLVES,,

A foraging predator should maximize energetic gains by selectively choosing patches with higher prey density. However, catching behaviorally responsive and group-forming prey in patchy environments can be a challenge for predators. First, they have to identify the profitable patches, and second, they must manage the prey's sophisticated anti-predator behavior. Thus, the forager and its prey have to continuously adjust their behavior to that of their opponent. Given these conditions, the foraging predator's behavior should be dynamic with time in terms of foraging effort and prey capture rates across different patches. Theoretically, the allocation of its time among patches of behaviorally responsive prey should be such that it equalizes its prey capture rates across patches through time. We tested this prediction in a model system containing a predator (little egret) and group forming prey (common gold fish) in two sets of experiments in which (1) patches (pools) contained equal numbers of prey, or in which (2) patches contained unequal densities of prey. The egret equalized the prey capture rate through time in both equal and different density experiments. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Shrub and tree encroachment, and the expansion of forest birds and the formerly persecuted mammalian ungulates and carnivores, were highlighted as the major consequences of the rural exodus in Italy. In this report, we provide a more integrative view, and show that a rural exodus also explains other ecological phenomena that are usually treated independently. After reviewing the ecological consequences of the rural exodus that has been affecting a large part of Spain during the last six decades, we suggest that this set of ecological consequences also includes the movement of shy-selected predators and large, big game species out of their former ecological refuges, as well as increased frequencies of individuals with bolder-behaviours in recovering populations. We develop a tentative conceptual model linking the increasing approach of wildlife to anthropogenic habitats and human depopulation of rural areas. These links are created by the increasing difficulty to survive and reproduce in recovering, high-predation wild areas, due to mesopredator release and the loss of fear to humans, among other factors. We acknowledge that the recovery of formerly persecuted wildlife in depopulated landscapes has been helped by conservation policies, but we suggest that policies alone cannot explain the observed changes. Finally, we propose that the processes we analyse on a national scale could be taking place in Europe on a continental scale as well, and will most likely occur in the future in other regions of the world, with the current growth in economies.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  6     Total Times Cited:  6     Cited Reference Count:  114 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.biocon.2020.108860     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Human depopulation;Wildlife recovery;Cropland abandonment;Range expansion;Changed human attitudes;Refuge abandonment;Approach to urban areas;Bold behaviour;SPANISH IMPERIAL EAGLE;LAND-USE CHANGES;ORYCTOLAGUS-CUNICULUS;LANDSCAPE CHANGES;HUMAN DISTURBANCE;MOUNTAIN AREAS;URSUS-ARCTOS;BROWN BEARS;ABANDONMENT;BIRD;Humanities;Humanism;Humans,,

We, thus, present a first empirical investigation of the indirect, informational consequences of perceived predation risk. Specifically, we focus on the ability to track the quality of seed patches in sandy habitats. There are two potential effects here; since instantaneous intake rate (or some proxy) is the key parameter of interest to an optimal forager, apprehension can interfere with the estimation of: (1) the number of food items captured, and/or (2) the time taken to capture them (the ability to locate food items). Only (2) will have a consistent effect on patch quality, and we test the hypothesis that increased predation risk reduces gerbil search efficiency. We therefore quantified gerbil search paths in patches of uniform seed distribution that differed in their associated risks of predation by manipulating the presence of barn owls, Tyto alba, and light in an aviary. Gerbil search was more random under risky conditions. We discuss the implications of this result for information processing and patch use under predation risk, and the foraging games between gerbils and owls in the Negev Desert.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  55     Total Times Cited:  58     Cited Reference Count:  34 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",,FORAGING BEHAVIOR;PREDATION;RISK;VIGILANCE;SNAKES;COSTS;Gerbillinae,,

Thus, taxa in which males pay a high cost for mating offer researchers an ideal system to test traditional sex roles. Males courting potentially sexually cannibalistic females may be under strong selection to bias their courtship efforts away from hungry females that may be more likely to attack. Here we tested the prediction that web-based chemotactile cues of recent female foraging success influence male courtship in the black widow spider, Latrodectus hesperus. In addition, we tested the underlying assumption that previous female foraging success reduces precopulatory sexually cannibalistic attacks. We found that males courted well-fed females significantly more than they did starved females, and that this bias was maintained in the absence of the female when males encountered only (1) cues from female webs and (2) cues from female silk after web architecture had been eliminated. A nonsignificant courtship bias in favour of well-fed females was also evident when these females were transplanted to the webs of starved females. Male courtship biases in favour of well-fed females appear adaptive, as starved females were significantly more likely to attack males before mating. We conclude by noting that sexual cannibalism offers a model system wherein the exploitation of cues of predation risk have unique implications such as the effects on male courtship preferences seen here.

We have explored the adaptive significance of the prolonged copulations in the golden egg bug (copulations up to 50 h) and the effect of an increased risk of sperm competition on ejaculate investment. Our data support predictions derived from sperm competition theory, which posits that males are expected to increase ejaculate expenditure in response to an increased risk of sperm competition. Results show a combined response by males that has not been previously described: males in the presence of rivals increase copulation duration and the rate of sperm transfer. No relationship was found between male or female size and copulation duration or ejaculate size. Golden egg bug males transfer sperm slowly and gradually throughout copulation; thus an increase in the amount of sperm transferred and the corresponding increase in the male's numerical representation in the female's storage organs could be particularly important in a system in which so few sperm are transferred and in which so few sperm are stored by females. In addition, copulation duration may not only serve to increase the total amount of sperm transferred, but it may also increase the chances that the female will lay an egg soon after copulation has ended. This could explain why males tend to accept eggs after copulation, since they could be maximizing the chances that such eggs are fathered by them, and in this way they would substantially increase the survival rates of their offspring because eggs laid on plants suffer high mortality rates.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  62     Total Times Cited:  63     Cited Reference Count:  69 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1093/beheco/arg095     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),copulation;ejaculate size;golden egg bug;Phyllomorpha laciniata;sperm competition;sperm loading hypothesis;OPERATIONAL SEX-RATIO;WATER STRIDER;PROLONGED COPULATION;SOAPBERRY BUG;PARENTAL CARE;MALE CRICKETS;GAMES;PATERNITY;HETEROPTERA;PREDATION;Ejaculation;Ovum,,

The negative impacts of introduced predators are well documented, yet a fundamental knowledge gap exists regarding the efficiency of potential mitigation methods to restore the ecosystem. Other understudied aspects concern prey behavioural antipredator responses and the historical context of native predator-prey interactions, which may moderate invasion impacts on native prey. Invasion impacts of American mink (Neovison vison) and raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides) into the Baltic Sea archipelago are poorly understood, and the efficiency of removal efforts as a means to alleviate depredation pressure on native prey is debated. Here, we examine the effectiveness of invasive predator removal on ground-nesting female common eider (Somateria mollissima) mortality, breeding success and breeding propensity over a 9-year period, while controlling for predation risk imposed by the main native predator, the white-tailed eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla). Our results clearly show that intensified removal of American minks and raccoon dogs decreased the number of female eiders killed during nesting, while improving both nesting success and breeding propensity. Such obvious positive effects of invasive predator removal are particularly noteworthy against the backdrop of a soaring eagle population, indicating that the impacts of invasives may become accentuated when native predators differ taxonomically and by hunting mode. This study shows that invasive alien predator removal is an effective conservation measure clearly aiding native fauna even under severe native predation pressure. Such cost-effective conservation actions call for governmental deployment across large areas.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  1     Total Times Cited:  1     Cited Reference Count:  50 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s00442-021-05101-8     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Avian conservation;Invasive species;Predator control;Ecosystem restoration;Common eider;EAGLE HALIAEETUS-ALBICILLA;ANTIPREDATOR BEHAVIOR;MESOPREDATOR RELEASE;BREEDING SUCCESS;BIODIVERSITY;POPULATION;MINK;SIZE;REPRODUCTION;STRATEGIES;Prednisolone;Emigrants and Immigrants,,

Sufficient and necessary conditions of spatial pattern formation are obtained for various functional responses between prey and predators. By mathematical and numerical analyses, we find that small prey sensitivity to predation risk may lead to pattern formation if the Holling type II functional response or the Beddington-DeAngelis functional response is adopted while large cost of anti-predator behaviors homogenises the system by excluding pattern formation. However, the ratio-dependent functional response gives an opposite result where large predator-taxis may lead to pattern formation but small cost of anti -predator behaviors inhibits the emergence of spatial heterogeneous solutions.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  28     Total Times Cited:  31     Cited Reference Count:  47 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Included""}",10.3934/mbe.2018035     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Pattern formation;stability;predator-prey model;anti-predator behaviors;bifurcation;global stability;SPATIOTEMPORAL COMPLEXITY;MUTUAL INTERFERENCE;GLOBAL BIFURCATION;PATCHY INVASION;SYSTEM;DYNAMICS;EXISTENCE;Prednisolone,,

A graphical model by Ydenberg and Dill (1986. The economics of fleeing from predators. Adv. Stud. Behav. 16, 229-249) that has guided research for the past 20 years specifies when escape begins. In the model, a prey detects a predator, monitors its approach until costs of escape and of remaining are equal, and then flees. The distance between predator and prey when escape is initiated (approach distance = flight initiation distance) occurs where decreasing cost of remaining and increasing cost of fleeing intersect. We argue that prey fleeing as predicted cannot maximize fitness because the best prey can do is break even during an encounter. We develop two optimality models, one applying when all expected future contribution to fitness (residual reproductive value) is lost if the prey dies, the other when any fitness gained (increase in expected RRV) during the encounter is retained after death. Both models predict optimal flight initiation distance from initial expected fitness, benefits obtainable during encounters, costs of escaping, and probability of being killed. Predictions match extensively verified predictions of Ydenberg and Dill's (1986) model. Our main conclusion is that optimality models are preferable to break-even models because they permit fitness maximization, offer many new testable predictions, and allow assessment of prey decisions in many naturally occurring situations through modification of benefit, escape cost, and risk functions.

We discuss a population-dynamic approach which plays a central role in the analysis of evolutionary processes. The basic principle is that the phenotypes with the greatest long-term average growth rate will dominate the entire population. The calculation of long-term average growth rates for populations under temporal stochasticity can be highly cumbersome. However, for a discrete non-overlapping population, it is identical to the geometric mean of the growth rates (geometric mean fitness), which is usually different from the simple arithmetic mean of growth rates. Evolutionary outcomes based on geometric mean fitness are often very different from the predictions based on the usual arithmetic mean fitness. In this paper we illustrate the concept of geometric mean fitness in a few simple models. We discuss its implications for the adaptive evolution of phenotypes, e.g. foraging under predation risks and clutch size. Next, we present an application: the risk-spreading egg-laying behaviour of the cabbage white butterfly, and develop a two-patch population dynamic model to show how the optimal solution diverges from the usual arithmetic mean approach. The dynamics of these stochastic models cannot be predicted from the dynamics of simple deterministic models. Thus the inclusion of stochastic factors in the analyses of populations is essential to the understanding of not only population dynamics, but also their evolutionary dynamics.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  59     Total Times Cited:  59     Cited Reference Count:  193 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/BF02515724     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),stochastic environments;adaptation;geometric mean fitness;trade offs;games;extinction;RANDOMLY VARYING ENVIRONMENTS;ESS GERMINATION STRATEGIES;WITHIN-GENERATION VARIANCE;BET-HEDGING GERMINATION;NATURAL-SELECTION;CLUTCH-SIZE;VARIABLE ENVIRONMENTS;DESERT ANNUALS;PROBABILISTIC OPTIMIZATION;OPTIMIZING REPRODUCTION;Population Dynamics,,

Crypsis may be especially important for ambush foragers, which spend much of their time above ground and therefore benefit from being inconspicuous to predators and prey. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of rattlesnake skin colouration on the likelihood of it being detected and attacked by a predator, on the latency (time) to attack, and on the attack frequency on each physical body section of the models. Clay models representing four commonly observed rattlesnake colour morphs (light, dark and two intermediate colour patterns) were deployed in two different habitat types (wooded area and open field), and the marks made on the models by predators were quantified over time. We found that light snake models, which have little contrast with substrate, were less likely to be attacked and were attacked later than darker model types, which have higher contrast with substrate. Predators attacked the various body segments of the models at similar frequencies. Our data suggest dark-coloured rattlesnakes, which have the most contrast with the golden-coloured grasses and therefore have the lowest crypsis, are most at risk from predation.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  1     Total Times Cited:  1     Cited Reference Count:  54 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/jzo.12786     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),colouration;Crotalus oreganus helleri;crypsis;pit viper;predation risk;clay models;ANTIPREDATOR BEHAVIOR;GROUND-SQUIRRELS;ZIGZAG PATTERN;SNAKE;APOSEMATISM;MIMICRY;CRYPSIS;VISION;SHIFTS;BIRDS;Prednisolone;Crotalus,,

The estimated cost of sheep and cattle production losses caused by wild dogs when combined with an extensive range of control measures, costs the Australian economy AU$66 million annually. Spatio-temporal data derived from global navigation satellite system (GNSS) devices were used to quantify the behavioural responses of two flocks of 15 Merino ewes ranging from 2 to 8 years old (average 4.5 years) during simulated dog predation events. Each sheep was fitted with a GNSS collar, and the behavioural responses of the sheep were video recorded during six trials (three per flock). The behavioural data collated from video recordings were then compared with the movement metrics derived from the GNSS collars. Derived metrics include the spatial distribution of flock members, speed of animal movement and specific behavioural changes including centripetal rotation (circling behaviour of the flock, with individual sheep seeking the centre). While the spatial distribution data did not appear to be specific enough to enable identification of a predation event, the velocity of sheep was higher (P < 0.001) during compared with before and after a simulated dog predation event. Centripetal rotation occurred in 80% of the simulated predation events during this study, and may provide a means for identifying predation. The spatio-temporal data from GNSS devices have potential as a research tool to assist in understanding sheep movement patterns during a dog attack. While further research and mathematical modelling of predation events is clearly required, the application of remote sensing technology has the potential to improve future livestock monitoring.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  15     Total Times Cited:  16     Cited Reference Count:  29 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1071/AN14221     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),behaviour;dog attack;global positioning system;remote monitoring;FEEDING-BEHAVIOR;AUSTRALIA;DINGOES;COYOTE;RISK;FEAR;Pilot Projects;Dogs;Sheep;Prednisolone,,

In many cases, exotic species are predators of native prey which do not respond correctly to these new and often much different threats. Amphibians, as a group, have been strongly affected by introductions of fish and other aquatic predators such as crayfish. Our goal in this study was to explore the potential impacts of exotic crayfish on the behaviour, morphology, and survival of naive wood frog tadpoles, Lithobates sylvaticus. In mesocosms, groups of tadpoles were exposed to either a native predator (larval beetle or dragonfly nymph) or an exotic crayfish, Orconectes virilis. Tadpoles were the largest following exposure to dragonflies, indicating that dragonflies were selecting smaller tadpoles. Vertical space use of tadpoles was highest in the presence of crayfish, suggesting that tadpoles were learning to avoid crayfish in the benthos. Mortality was highest in the presence of beetles and lowest with crayfish, and hence in isolation, exotic crayfish were poorer predators of wood frog tadpoles. However, half way through the experiment, we replaced each predator with a new predator of either the same species or a different species to assess how the impact of the new predator was affected by experience with the first predator. When crayfish were added following beetles, the mortality due to crayfish increased significantly, possibly due to differences in predator space use and foraging mode.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  48 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s10452-019-09696-2     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Active-pursuit;Foraging mode;Introduced predators;Predation risk;Sit-and-wait;ANTIPREDATOR BEHAVIOR;PROCAMBARUS-CLARKII;PREY INTERACTIONS;RECOGNITION;INTRODUCTIONS;IMPACT;CONSEQUENCES;ECOSYSTEMS;NAIVETE;ECOLOGY;Prednisolone,,

We developed a mathematical model that examines the relationships between the abundance of primary prey, patch exploitation (i.e., quitting harvest rates), and the rate of incidental predation on secondary prey items. The model's predictions are dependent upon the spatial scale over which a forager integrates foraging costs and thus determines its quitting harvest rate (QHR). At local (i.e., foraging) spatial scales, we predicted that incidental predation should increase with local food abundance. Also at the foraging scale, local food abundance should not influence QHRs, but local predation risk (from higher trophic levels) should increase QHRs. Therefore, we predicted that incidental predation rates should be negatively correlated with QHRs. Over large (i.e., landscape) spatial scales, greater food abundance and predation risk increase QHRs, and we predicted that predation rates should vary inversely with QHR through two complementary mechanisms: foragers use a greater proportion of space and spend more time foraging as quitting harvest rates decrease.        We experimentally tested the qualitative predictions of the theory in the field using artificial Veery (Catharus fuscescens) nests depredated by white-footed mice, Peromyscus leucopus, across three spatial scales. We used the technique of giving-up densities to measure QHRs and to determine the scale at which mice integrate different foraging costs. In accord with our predictions, nest predation was positively influenced by the local abundance of food at the foraging scale, and local predation risk to mice and perhaps interference competition from chipmunks resulted in higher giving-up densities and lower nest predation. At the landscape scale, there was an inverse relationship between giving-up densities and nest predation, which was probably the result of large-scale differences in resource abundance between plots. Our study demonstrates how linking theoretical development to the use of empirical behavioral indicators can help determine the relevant ecological scales and processes necessary for understanding predator-prey interactions.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  55     Total Times Cited:  56     Cited Reference Count:  63 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.2307/2679972     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),enemy-free space;foraging ecology;generalist;giving-up densities;incidental predation;nest predation;patch use;quitting harvest rate;Peromyscus leucopus;ENEMY-FREE-SPACE;PATCH USE;TAMIAS-STRIATUS;FOREST FRAGMENTATION;PEROMYSCUS-LEUCOPUS;BAYESIAN FORAGERS;FOX SQUIRRELS;QUAIL EGGS;DEER MICE;RISK;Prednisolone,,

Understanding species' responses to temperature via behavior, and the factors affecting the extent of behavioral responses, is a critical and timely endeavor given the rapid pace at which the climate is changing. The young of altricial songbirds are particularly sensitive to temperature, and parents may modulate temperatures at nests via selection of nest sites, albeit to a largely unknown extent. We examined whether sagebrush-obligate songbirds, that reproduce within an open ecosystem with wide temperature fluctuations and span a range of body sizes, selected their nest sites on the basis of temperature. We further investigated whether nest predation risk and ambient conditions modulated temperature-based choices. We placed temperature loggers at nest sites and in unused but available nest niches and nest shrubs along a known predation-risk gradient and used nearby weather stations to determine ambient temperatures. The two smaller-bodied birds, Brewer's Sparrow (Spizella breweri) and Sagebrush Sparrow (Artemisiospiza nevadensis), selected nest shrubs and niches that were warmer and less variable relative to unused sites whereas the larger bodied species, Sage Thrashers (Oreoscoptes montanus), did not. Brewer's Sparrows and Sage Thrashers dampened selection for warmer nest sites when temperatures experienced during the nest-site prospecting period were warmer. None of the three species altered nest-site selection with respect to temperature in response to ambient temperature variability or our index of nest predation risk. The microhabitat characteristics that most influenced temperatures at nests varied across species. Our results suggest that songbirds can modulate temperatures at nests to some extent, and such responses can vary depending on the conditions experienced prior to nest initiation. Responses also varied across species, likely reflecting different physiological tolerances. The extent to which breeding birds will be able to continue to proximately influence temperature via nest-site choices likely will depend on the extent and rate of future climatic shifts.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  1     Total Times Cited:  1     Cited Reference Count:  59 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1093/ornithology/ukac004     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Brewer's Sparrow;microclimate;nest predation;nest-site selection;Sagebrush Sparrow;Sage Thrasher;temperature;PREDATION RISK;ENERGY DEVELOPMENT;HABITAT SELECTION;PREFERENCES;RESPONSES;LANDSCAPE;EVOLUTION;SURVIVAL;PARENTS;SHIFTS;Temperature,,

Yet such a correlation might arise either because some individuals are better able than others to detect environmental changes or because the benefits of being plastic are condition-dependent. To discriminate between these two competing hypotheses, I developed an individual-based model that simulates a population in which individuals of varying fighting ability compete by pairwise interactions using either the fixed hawk (aggressive) or dove (peaceful) strategies or a conditional assessment strategy. As anticipated, the model predicts that only individuals with low (and/or intermediate) fighting ability should use the assessment strategy, giving rise to a negative (or dome-shaped) relationship between aggressiveness and plasticity. The proportion of plastic individuals, however, should be affected not only by the environmental conditions in which individuals live but also by the mechanism that would maintain variation in the traits that determine the benefits of plasticity. In particular, if individual differences in fighting ability may be eroded by natural selection, it predicts that ecological conditions that cause assortative interactions (e.g. high predation risks) would contribute in maintaining variation among individuals in their fighting ability, thereby favouring greater plasticity.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  5     Total Times Cited:  5     Cited Reference Count:  39 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1098/rspb.2019.1323     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),among-individual differences;behavioural plasticity;hawk-dove game;personality;social specialization;assortative interactions;INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES;BEHAVIORAL SYNDROMES;ANIMAL PERSONALITY;CONSISTENT;ECOLOGY;POPULATIONS;EVOLUTION;BOLDNESS;ABILITY;TRAITS,,

Here, we build a game-theoretical model, based on an evolutionary algorithm, to study the influence of ecological factors on the temporal patterns of presence at waterholes in the herbivore community. In this model, we incorporate the specific features of arid environments, namely, the important hydric losses endured by individuals exposed during the warmest hours of the day, and competition for access to water, both within and between species. We also consider the presence of ambushing predators around waterholes, particularly during dark hours. In response to this predation regime, our model predicts a strong aggregative tendency in herbivores. The number of groups, however, is variable, as well as the time these groups choose to attend the waterhole, even if the total number of individuals is fixed. The reason is a multiplicity of possible evolutionarily stable strategies, corresponding to different responses to the trade-off between the advantages of grouping, in terms of risk dilution, and its costs, in terms of increased competition. This variety of possible behavioural responses affects, in turn, the moments when the waterhole is occupied, and the moments when the different species meet each other. In general, herbivores also respond to predation threat by avoiding coming to waterholes after dusk. However, the cumulative effects of a relatively high level of predation during the day and a high level of interspecific competition for access to water may induce an important presence of herbivores at the waterhole at night. Our predictions are discussed in the light of existing empirical studies.

We thus investigated red deer movement responses to drive hunts and their causal factors. We studied 34 hunting events in the National Estate of Chambord (France) and thereby provided a fine-scale characterization of the immediate and delayed movement responses of red deer to drive hunts. Red deer responded to drive hunts either by immediately fleeing the hunted area, or by initially remaining before ultimately fleeing after the hunters had departed. A few hours after the hunt, all individuals were located in distant areas (> 2 kilometres) from the hunted area. Immediate flight responses were less common when drive hunts occurred in areas with dense understorey. However, neither beater/dog densities nor site familiarity influenced the immediate flight decision. Following a drive hunt, red deer remained outside the hunted areas for periods twice as long compared to periods when no hunting occurred (34 hours vs. 17 hours). Such knowledge of game movement rates in response to drive hunts may help the development of informed management policy for hunted red deer populations.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  2     Total Times Cited:  3     Cited Reference Count:  65 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1371/journal.pone.0228865     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),PREDATION RISK;ANTIPREDATOR BEHAVIOR;HABITAT SELECTION;FLIGHT;DISTURBANCE;MANAGEMENT;SPACE;FEAR,,

Can these population-level effects influence interactions with prey? Do changes in prey abundance have feedback effects on the frequency of spiteful behaviour? Does altruism (a behaviour that helps others at the risk of harming the actor) also have population-level effects?        Mathematical methods: A game theory model of the evolution of spite within a population is combined with a model of predator-prey dynamics.        Key assumptions: Our analysis applies to cases where spite reduces individual fitness without destroying resources (prey). Predators, which may be spiteful, consume prey with a type 11 functional response. Prey experience logistic growth. Predator growth depends on prey consumption.        Predictions: If spite can invade a population, the resulting conflict within the population reduces its consumption of prey and thus lowers prey mortality. This results in an apparent conservation of resources. This reduction in prey consumption can increase the stability of the predator-prey interaction. Surprisingly, the addition of spite to a predator Population may increase its equilibrium density at the predator-prey equilibrium. Through its effect on Population dynamics, spite can lead to an interaction between evolutionary and ecological dynamics resulting in an evolutionarily stable equilibrium with a mixture of spiteful and non-spiteful strategies. Behaviours whose harm to others exceeds their benefits to the actor can also stabilize predator-prey interactions. Altruism (a behaviour that risks harm to the actor in order to benefit others) can have the opposite effect of spite at the Population level.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  4     Total Times Cited:  4     Cited Reference Count:  27 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",,altruism;egotism;natural selection;population size;population stability;resource conservation;spite;DANGEROUS PREY;PREDATOR;COEVOLUTION;DYNAMICS;BEHAVIOR;PARADOX;SNAKES;Population Dynamics,,

We tested in two experiments the evolutionary costs and benefits of the yellow colour pattern in fire salamanders (Salamandra salarnandra), which display a yellow/black colour pattern usually associated with toxic alkaloids. Ow first experiment aimed to test whether the development of colouration is condition dependent and thus related to developmental costs, i.e. influenced by resource availability during the developmental process. Therefore, we reared fire salamander larvae under different nutritional conditions and compared the relative amount of yellow they developed after metamorphosis. Fire salamander larvae reared under limited food conditions had a lower proportion of yellow following metamorphosis than control larvae reared under superior food conditions. in a second experiment we tested whether the proportion of yellow has an impact on the risk of being attacked using artificial models. We tested, in salamander-free and salamander-occupied natural habitats, whether artificial clay models with different proportions of yellow and black receive different attack rates from potential predators (birds, mammals, insects). in clay models the proportion of yellow and the site had a significant effect on predation risk. Models with larger amounts of yellow had fewer bite marks from predators such as carabid beetles and birds, but only in sympatry with salamanders. In conclusion, the early expression of conspicuous colouration seems to be condition dependent and therefore potentially costly. Furthermore, the yellow colouration of fire salamanders act as a signal that potentially reduces their risk of being attacked by predators. Thus, the yellow colouration of fire salamanders seems to represent an adaptive trait that reduces the risk of predation, which can be expressed in higher quantity by individuals of a certain condition.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  2     Total Times Cited:  2     Cited Reference Count:  64 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1163/15685381-bja10006     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),aposematic colouration;early developmental stress;predation risk;predator avoidance;warning colours;NUTRITIONAL CONDITIONS;OOPHAGA-PUMILIO;PREY;EVOLUTION;PATTERN;APOSEMATISM;BEHAVIOR;CONSPICUOUSNESS;CAROTENOIDS;POPULATIONS,,

Yet we still know little of how horses contribute to key ecological interactions including predator-prey and indirect competitive relationships at a community level. Notably, feral species like horses can exhibit life-history traits that differ from that of native (mainly artiodactyl) herbivore competitors. Artificial selection for traits like increased, early, or extended reproduction that have yet to be reversed by natural selection, coupled with naturally selected differences in anatomy and behavior, in addition to unique management objectives for horses compared to other species, means that the dynamics of feral horse populations are not likely to align with what might be expected of other large herbivores. Unexpected population dynamics and inherent biological asymmetries between native ungulates and feral horses may therefore influence the former via direct competition for shared resources and through enemy-mediated interactions like apparent competition. In several localities feral horses now co-exist with multiple native prey species, some of which are in decline or are species at risk. Compounding risks to native species from direct or indirect competitive exclusion by horses is the unique nature and socio-political context of feral horse management, which tends towards allowing horse populations to be limited largely by natural, density-dependent factors. We summarize the inherent asymmetries between feral horse biology and that of other ungulate prey species with consequences for conservation, focusing on predator-prey and emerging indirect interactions in multi-prey systems, and highlight future directions to address key knowledge gaps in our understanding of how feral horses may now be contributing to the (re)structuring of food webs. Observations of patterns of rapid growth and decline, and associated skews in sex ratios of feral horse populations, indicate a heightened potential for indirect interactions among large ungulate prey species, where there is a prevalence of feral horses as preferred prey, particularly where native prey are declining. In places like western North America, we expect predator-prey interactions involving feral horses to become an increasingly important factor in the conservation of wildlife. This applies not only to economically or culturally important game species but also at-risk species, both predators (e.g., wolves [Canis lupus], grizzly bears [Ursus arctos]) and prey (e.g., woodland caribou [Rangifer tarandus caribou]), necessitating an ecological understanding of the role of horses in natural environments that goes beyond that of population control.

Something as simple as allowing predators to move in response to prey movements might not only (radically) alter standard expectations of prey behavior, but might also reveal new classes of behavioral phenomena that occur at large spatial scales. Similar revelations undoubtedly await many well-studied aspects of the behavioral interaction between predator and prey. Most examples studied to date, both theoretical and empirical, require attention from this 'predatory' perspective.

In this study, we analyzed the defensive responses of a subterranean rodent species, the plateau zokor (Eospalax baileyi), to predation threat, and examined the trade-offs between defensive responses and foraging. Plateau zokors were exposed to 1, 3, and 6 g of eagle owl (Bubo bubo) feces, and the anti-predator behavioral, hormonal, and hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing factor and c-fos mRNA expression responses were analyzed and compared with the control (distilled water). Exposure of the animals to owl feces led to significant reductions in both duration of feeding and amount of food consumed, while some defensive behavioral responses (e.g., freezing and rearing) were more significant in the exposed animals than in the control. Serum levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone and corticosterone in plateau zokors exposed to owl feces were significantly higher compared with the control. The hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing factor and c-fos mRNA expression levels of plateau zokors exposed to 1, 3, and 6 g owl feces increased significantly, concomitant with the amount of eagle owl feces presented. Owl feces induced various behavioral, hormonal, and hypothalamic gene expression changes in plateau zokors exposed to them. Some behavioral and gene expression (but not hormonal) responses appeared to be threshold dependent. Significance statement Predator odors supersede other signals and can provide comprehensive information to prey during life-threatening events. The plateau zokor is a typical subterranean rodent living in dark and enclosed subterranean habitats. Owing to this special habitat, zokors may be able to recognize ground predator odors and respond defensively. We investigated changes in behavior, hormones, and the hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing factor and c-fos mRNA expression levels of the plateau zokor when exposed to different amounts of eagle owl feces. We believe that our study makes a significant contribution to the literature because our results support the predation risk allocation hypothesis, showing that eagle owl feces inhibit foraging and induce various anti-predatory behavioral and neuroendocrine responses in plateau zokors.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  68 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s00265-020-02934-w     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Anti-predator;Behavior;Physiology;Plateau zokor;Eagle owl feces;PREDATOR ODORS;CRF PEPTIDE;FOOD-INTAKE;CAT ODOR;STRESS;RATS;RISK;RECOGNITION;ANXIETY;TRIMETHYLTHIAZOLINE;Feces;Prednisolone,,

Disturbance from human hunting is known to alter habitat use in ungulates, but recent work suggests that hunting may also trigger the onset of migration. Whether this holds true across ungulate species and hunting systems warrants further empirical testing. We used global positioning system location data from mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) in south-central Wyoming, USA, to evaluate the sex-specific effects of hunting on habitat selection and migratory behavior from 2016 to 2018. We modeled habitat selection before and during hunting season using a step selection function, and we used time-to-event models to evaluate if hunting triggered migration. We found habitat selection and migration timing to be sex specific. Males responded to hunting season by selecting security habitat away from motorized routes, whereas females used habitat through hunting season that retained higher forage quality. Weather, as indexed by temperature and precipitation (i.e., snowfall), influenced migration timing for males and females. Migration timing in males was influenced by migration distance, where individuals traveling >50 km tended to migrate earlier than individuals moving <50 km. For deer that survived to rifle season, hunting was less influential on migration timing than environmental factors. Rifle season increased the likelihood of migration by 2% in females and <0.01% in males compared to outside rifle season. Our findings suggest that roadless areas on mule deer summer ranges and within migration corridors reduce the effects of hunting disturbance. Consequently, managers may consider limiting the use of motorized vehicles as a method for reducing effects on migration from hunting disturbance.

Traditionally, large eyespots were thought to discourage predator attacks because they mimicked eyes of the predators' own predators. However, this idea is controversial and the intimidating properties of eyespots have recently been suggested to Amply be a consequence of their conspicuousness. Some lepidopteran species include large eyespots in their antipredation repertoire. In the peacock butterfly, Mathis io, eyespots are typically hidden during rest and suddenly exposed by the butterfly when disturbed. Previous experiments have shown that small wild passerines are intimidated by this display. Here, we test whether eyespots also intimidate a considerably larger bird, domestic fowl, Gallus gallus domesticus, by staging interactions between birds and peacock butterflies that were sham-painted or had their eyespots painted oven Our results show that birds typically fled when peacock butterflies performed their display regardless of whether eyespots were visible or painted over. However, birds confronting butterflies with visible eyespots delayed their return to the butterfly, were more vigilant, and more likely to utter alarm calls associated with detection of ground-based predators, compared with birds confronting butterflies with eyespots painted over. Because production of alarm calls and increased vigilance are antipredation behaviors in the fowl, their reaction suggests that eyespots may elicit fear rather than just an aversion to conspicuous patterns. Our results, therefore, suggest that predators perceive large lepidopteran eyespots as belonging to the eyes of a potential predator.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  31     Total Times Cited:  32     Cited Reference Count:  37 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1093/beheco/ars167     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),chicken;predator-prey interactions;startle display;RED JUNGLEFOWL;SOCIAL-ORGANIZATION;GALLUS-GALLUS;PREDATION;SURVIVAL;DEFENSE;CONSPICUOUSNESS;INTIMIDATION;POPULATION,,

However, few studies have empirically assessed the extent to which selective foraging behaviour is dynamic and varies in response to environmental conditions for free-ranging animal populations. Here, we assessed the extent that forage selection fluctuated in response to different environmental conditions for a free-ranging herbivore, moose (Alces alces), in Isle Royale National Park, over a 10-year period. More precisely, we assessed how moose selection for coniferous versus deciduous forage in winter varied between geographic regions and in relation to (a) the relative frequency of forage types in the environment (e.g. frequency-dependent foraging behaviour), (b) moose abundance, (c) predation rate (by grey wolves) and (d) snow depth. These factors are potentially important for their influence on the energetics of foraging. We also built a series of food-chain models to assess the influence of dynamic foraging strategies on the stability of food webs. Our analysis indicates that moose exhibited negative frequency dependence, by selectively exploiting rare resources. Frequency-dependent foraging was further mediated by density-dependent processes, which are likely to be predation, moose abundance or some combination of both. In particular, frequency dependence was weaker in years when predation risk was high (i.e. when the ratio of moose to wolves was relatively low). Selection for conifers was also slightly weaker during deep snow years. The food-chain analysis indicates that the type of frequency-dependent foraging strategy exhibited by herbivores had important consequences for the stability of ecological communities. In particular, the dynamic foraging strategy that we observed in the empirical analysis (i.e. negative frequency dependence being mediated by density-dependent processes) was associated with more stable food web dynamics compared to fixed foraging strategies. The results of this study indicated that forage selection is a complex ecological process, varying in response to both biological (predation and moose density) and abiotic factors (snow depth) and over relatively small spatial scales (between regions). This study also provides a useful framework for assessing the influence of other aspects of foraging behaviour on the stability of food web dynamics.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  6     Total Times Cited:  6     Cited Reference Count:  56 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/1365-2656.13031     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),consumer-resource dynamics;context-dependent decision-making;diet choice;frequency-dependent foraging strategies;Manly's selection index;predation risk;selective foraging behaviour;snow depth;FUNCTIONAL-RESPONSE;DIET SELECTION;ISLE ROYALE;MULE DEER;MOOSE;POPULATION;PREDATION;LIMITATION;STRATEGIES;MOVEMENTS,,

Game theory has been used to predict many properties of groups (such as the expected group size), but little is known about the proximate mechanisms by which animals achieve these predicted properties. We explore a possible proximate mechanism using a spatially explicit, individual-based model, where individuals can choose to rest or forage on the basis of a rule-of-thumb that is dependent upon both their energetic reserves and the presence and actions of neighbours. The resulting behaviour and energetic reserves of individuals, and the resulting group sizes, are shown to be affected both by the ability of the forager to detect conspecifics and areas of the environment suitable for foraging, and by the distribution of energy in the environment. The model also demonstrates that if animals are able to choose (based upon their energetic reserves) between selecting the best foraging sites available and moving towards their neighbours for safety, then this also has significant effects upon individuals and group sizes. The implications of the proposed rule-of-thumb are discussed.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  45     Total Times Cited:  46     Cited Reference Count:  39 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1098/rspb.2004.2906     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),social foraging;optimization;perceptual range;group size;GROUP-SIZE;PREDATION RISK;SMALL BIRDS;BEHAVIOR;STRATEGIES;SEARCH;Animal Shells;Animals,,

This is especially true in an important area of study: anti-predatory vigilance. A simple exploration of vigilance shows that several ''single-predator'' expectations may not apply in a multi-predator environment. Two cases of vigilance are identified: predator-specific vigilance, in which the detection of a given predator requires a particular mode of vigilance, and non-specific vigilance, in which one mode of vigilance suffices for all predators. In both cases, and contrary to the single-predator situation, vigilance in a multi-predator environment may respond little or even negatively to increasing attack rates. Furthermore, predator-specific vigilance may be directed exclusively towards the most abundant predator in the environment; the ''ignored'' predators are nonetheless important determinants of vigilance. Finally, most studies usually focus on the most dangerous predator faced by the animal in question, but in doing so ignore the role of additional, seemingly innocuous predators as important determinants of vigilance. Studies adopting a ''multi-predator'' perspective promise to shed much light on the study of anti-predator behavior in general.

The efficiency of the beetles in finding and feeding on aphids was measured by watching beetles in laboratory arenas and small field cages that contained stems of wheat on which there were different prey types. Philonthus cognatus is a diurnal hunter on the ground, but wheat plants were climbed only prior to dispersal nights. Tachyporus species adults had similar daytime, predominantly crepuscular activity periods but larvae of these species were mainly nocturnal. Lower positions on plants were searched by the species than would provide regular contact with aphid colonies. The predominant food on the lower leaves were infections of the fungal pathogens, Septoria and Erisiphe species. Furthermore, many adult Tachyporus spp. were observed resting overnight on leaves of wheat on which mycophagy was observed. Mycophagy was resumed in the following activity period. The foraging behaviour of the different staphylinid species corresponded to the food preferences shown when offered aphids and mycoflora in laboratory experiments. Search on lower leaves by Tachyporus resulted mainly in mycophagy. However, Tachyporus spp. larvae and the less abundant T. obtusus, climbed higher on wheat plants and fed on aphids. When the other species climbed to higher positions on plants it was for the purpose of take-off for dispersal flights. From 75 climbs observed of these staphylinids, 9.5% of the total aphid population was eaten and 35% was displaced to the ground where risk of predation was greater from the numerically important Carabidae.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  13     Total Times Cited:  15     Cited Reference Count:  28 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",,STAPHYLINIDAE;FEEDING BEHAVIOR;CEREAL ECOSYSTEM;PREDATION;MYCOPHAGY;POLYPHAGOUS PREDATORS;SITOBION-AVENAE;WINTER-WHEAT;FIELD;COLEOPTERA;HEMIPTERA;CARABIDAE;PREY;Cereals,,

However, when released near their long-term nursery pens, juvenile Desert Tortoises (Gopherus agassizii) have been shown to initially attempt to return to their natal pen, which could have consequences for social interactions, spread of disease, and predation risk. We released 16 juvenile tortoises 500 m away from their home pen to determine whether this distance would eliminate such site fidelity. We tracked tortoises for three months following release. We monitored location, habitat use, activity, and survival. Tortoises showed no tendency to return to the natal pen following release; most settled into one location within two weeks of release. Seven of 16 tortoises were killed over a six-week period, apparently by a single Common Raven (Corvus corax). Predation risk was significantly affected by size; only tortoises with masses <125 g were taken. Head-starting of tortoises to a larger size could result in higher survival rates, and releases at least 500 m from the natal pen could promote more normal dispersal. However, site fidelity could also be a useful management tool if it is desirable for tortoises to remain near their release location. Behaviors other than dispersal may also be altered by long-term residence in nursery pens, and further studies are warranted.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  12     Total Times Cited:  12     Cited Reference Count:  13 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",,captive rearing;dispersal;head-start;homing;neonatology;predation;reintroduction;Prednisolone,,

The emergent behaviour arises from simple underlying movement rules, but the evolutionary pressure which favours these rules has not been conclusively identified. Various explanations exist for the advantage to the individual of group formation: reduction of predation risk; increased foraging efficiency or reproductive success. Here, we adopt an individual-based model for group formation and subject it to simulated predation and foraging; the haploid individuals evolve via a genetic algorithm based on their relative success under such pressure. Our work suggests that flock or herd formation is likely to be driven by predator avoidance. Individual fitness in the model is strongly dependent on the presence of other phenotypes, such that two distinct types of evolved group can be produced by the same predation or foraging conditions, each stable against individual mutation. We draw analogies with multiple Nash equilibria theory of iterated games to explain and categorize these behaviours. Our model is sufficient to capture the complex behaviour of dynamic collective groups, yet is flexible enough to manifest evolutionary behaviour.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  108     Total Times Cited:  109     Cited Reference Count:  29 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1098/rspb.2007.0306     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),flocking;evolution;genetic algorithm;predation;foraging;Nash equilibrium;FISH SCHOOLS;BEHAVIOR;PREDATION;FLOCKING;TRANSITION;SIMULATION;FORAGERS;MOVEMENT;DYNAMICS;EVASION,,

Without dispersal, the Gordon-Schaefer harvesting model predicts that as the protected area increases, population abundance increases too but the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) decreases. This article shows that dispersal can change this prediction. For density independent balanced and fast dispersal, neither the MSY, nor population abundance depends on the protected area. For fast and unbalanced dispersal both the MSY and equilibrium population abundance are unimodal functions of the protected area size. For density dependent dispersal which is in direction of increasing fitness predictions depend on whether individuals react to mortality risk in harvested patch. When animals disregard harvesting risk, the results are similar to the case of density independent and balanced dispersal. When animals do consider harvesting risk, the results are similar to the case without dispersal. The models considered also show that dispersal reduces beneficial effect of protected areas, because population abundance is smaller when compared with no dispersal case. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Especially in areas where natural predators are absent, hunting is the essential management tool for regulating ungulate populations. Therefore, understanding the factors associated with harvest rates is the first step toward an adaptive management approach. Weather influences hunter and ungulate behavior and thus presumably harvest, but how and which meteorological parameters are linked to harvest numbers have rarely been evaluated. We used nearly 65,000 ""sit and wait"" and driven hunt harvests of roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) in Bavaria, Germany, and weather data from 2008 to 2017 to test for factors affecting roe deer harvests (i.e., temperature, rain hours, wind speed, sunshine duration, snow depth, workdays vs. weekends, month) using zero-inflated negative binomial mixed-effect models. Our results reveal that, besides workdays, high temperatures and prolonged rain resulted in fewer harvested animals, whereas sunshine duration in summer and snow height in snow-rich areas partially favored harvests during sitting hunts in summer and winter, respectively. The influence of wind speed varied over the course of the year. In summer and autumn, wind speed commonly had a negative effect, positively affecting harvests in winter in some regions. Daily harvest numbers decreased during the summer and autumn hunting periods (May till mid-October), while they increased during the winter period (mid-October till mid-January). Interestingly, harvest success during driven hunts, which are planned well in advance and therefore take place largely independent of weather conditions, was similarly affected by the weather. This result suggests that the inferred weather influence is not only due to the hunters' decisions but also due to deer behavior. Since many ungulate populations may further benefit from climate change, building an understanding of the relationship between hunting success and weather will aid adaptive ungulate management.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  1     Total Times Cited:  1     Cited Reference Count:  58 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1002/ece3.7825     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),behavior;climate change;game management;harvest success;ungulate;WHITE-TAILED DEER;HABITAT SELECTION;LANDSCAPE;RISK;IMPACTS;HUNTERS;MAMMALS;LYNX;Seasons,,

Roads are a prevalent, ever-increasing form of human disturbance on the landscape. In many places in western North America, energy development has brought human and road disturbance into seasonal winter range areas for migratory elk.        2. We sought to evaluate the predictions from the risk-disturbance hypothesis when studying elk response to roads during winter. Road proximity and crossing were used to evaluate these behaviours, which offered a rare comparison between two common measures of roads. We used integrated step selection analysis (iSSA) to evaluate four alternative hypotheses regarding the influence of roads on space-use behaviour across 175 elk-years of elk telemetry data, and we quantified both population-level and individual-level variations in responses.        3. We demonstrated, for the first time, how iSSA can be used to combine movement analysis in a refined approach to habitat selection. Elk responded to roads as they would natural predation risk. Elk selected areas farther from roads at all times of day with avoidance being greatest during twilight. In addition, elk sought cover and moved more when in the vicinity of roads. Road crossings were generally avoided, but this avoidance was weakest during daytime when elk were both moving and closer to roads.        4. Synthesis and applications. Energy development is transforming landscapes in western North America with the proliferation of roads, which we show is having substantial and multifaceted negative effects on elk movement and behaviour. These adverse effects can be mitigated by minimizing new road construction and by restricting traffic on roads as well as providing the protection of tree cover on elk winter ranges.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  59     Total Times Cited:  59     Cited Reference Count:  50 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/1365-2664.12768     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Alberta;Cervus elaphus;energy development;habitat selection;human disturbance;movement;relative selection strength;step selection function;winter range;ROCKY-MOUNTAIN ELK;RESOURCE SELECTION;HABITAT SELECTION;ANIMAL MOVEMENT;MULE DEER;PATTERNS;HETEROGENEITY;DYNAMICS;MODELS;WOLVES,,

Parents should thus adjust provisioning activity according to current predation threat levels. Moreover, life-history theory predicts that response to predation threat should be correlated with investment in current reproduction. We experimentally manipulated perceived predation threat in free-living great tits (Parus major) by presenting parents with a nest predator model while monitoring different aspects of provisioning behavior and nestling begging. Experiments were conducted in 2 years differing greatly in ecological conditions, including food availability. We further quantified male territorial aggressiveness and male and female exploratory tendency. Parents adjusted provisioning according to current levels of threat in an apparently adaptive way. They delayed nest visits during periods of elevated perceived predation threat and subsequently compensated for lost feeding opportunities by increasing provisioning once the immediate threat had diminished. Nestling begging increased after elevated levels of predation threat, but returned to baseline levels by the end of the experiment, suggesting that parents had fully compensated for lost feeding opportunities. There was no evidence for a link between male exploration behavior or aggressiveness and provisioning behavior. In contrast, fast-exploring females provisioned at higher rates, but only in the year with poor environmental conditions, which might indicate a greater willingness to invest in current reproduction in general. Future work should assess whether these personality-related differences in delivery rates under harsher conditions came at a cost of reduced residual reproductive value.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  3     Total Times Cited:  3     Cited Reference Count:  96 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1093/beheco/arz060     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),life-history trade-off;offspring provisioning;parental care;parental investment;predation risk;risk-taking;TITS PARUS-MAJOR;BROOD SIZE MANIPULATIONS;PIED FLYCATCHER;TRADE-OFFS;BLUE TITS;PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY;FORAGING PERFORMANCE;UNRELATED HELPERS;BIPARENTAL CARE;GREAT;Prednisolone;Parenting,,

Flight initiation distances (FIDs) are often used to inform development of appropriate buffer distances required for human exclusion zones used to protect birds nesting in anthropogenic landscapes. Piping Plovers (Charadrius melodus) are protected by the Endangered Species Act in the United States and often nest in areas used by humans. Studies evaluating Piping Plover FIDs are limited and implementation of exclusion zones has been inconsistent across the species' range. We measured Piping Plover response and FIDs to naturally occurring stimuli on public beaches at Lake McConaughy, Nebraska, USA. Piping Plover FIDs differed most by stimulus class (vehicle, human, dog, human with dog), Julian day, and hour of day. Piping Plover FIDs were greatest for dog and human with dog compared to humans and vehicles. For all types of stimuli, Piping Plover FIDs decreased over time during the nesting season and increased slightly during each day. In the majority of instances in which Piping Plovers left their nests, return times to the nest were relatively short (less than three minutes). These results suggest Piping Plovers become habituated to the presence of human-related stimuli over the course of a nesting season, but other explanations such as parental investment and risk allocation cannot be excluded. Additional research and improved guidance regarding the implementation of exclusion zones is needed so managers can implement effective protection programs in anthropogenic landscapes.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  7     Total Times Cited:  9     Cited Reference Count:  54 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.5751/ACE-00826-110105     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Charadrius melodus;flight initiation distance;human disturbance;Piping Plover;recreation;BEHAVIORAL-RESPONSES;ANTIPREDATOR BEHAVIOR;THINORNIS-RUBRICOLLIS;FORAGING BEHAVIOR;PREDATION RISK;RETURN TIMES;HABITUATION;SELECTION;COLONIES;WILDLIFE;Humanities;Humanism;Humans,,

We monitored 39 radiocollared females from the Mentasta caribou herd, Alaska, in 1994 and 40 animals in 1995. Group size of females giving birth at higher elevations was smaller (P < 0.01) than females without young that occurred at lower elevations at peak parturition; that difference did not persist into post parturition (P > 0.5). During peak parturition, females with young used sites with fewer predators (P < 0.05), a lower abundance of forage (P < 0.05), but with variable forage quality compared with those sites used by females without young. We hypothesized that parturient females used birth sites that lowered risk of predation, and traded-off forage abundance for increased safety. Nonetheless, few differences existed between parturient and nonparturient females in composition of diet or in indices of diet quality; we could not demonstrate a nutritional cost to maternal females from our analyses. We suggest that increasing population density might intensify intraspecific competition among females for birth sites, and thereby increase nutritional costs of using high-elevation areas with less forage but fewer predators.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  106     Total Times Cited:  113     Cited Reference Count:  72 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.2307/3803279     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Alaska;caribou;diet;forage abundance;forage quality;group size;habitat use;parturition;predation risk;Rangifer tarandus;tradeoffs;MOUNTAIN SHEEP;WOODLAND CARIBOU;SEASONAL-CHANGES;CALVING SUCCESS;BIGHORN SHEEP;GROUP-SIZE;SELECTION;BEHAVIOR;MOOSE;STRATEGIES;Ecosystem,,

We estimated timing of parturition for 20 Mule deer ill northeastern Oregon, USA, using movement data from global positioning system (GPS) collars in 2005 and 2006. We then evaluated patterns of resource selection by female mule deer during late gestation, the week of parturition, and subsequent lactation to determine how different stages of reproduction influenced habitat selection. Movement rates of all but one deer declined sharply between late-May and mid-June, when female mule deer give birth in northeastern Oregon. Patterns of resource selection also varied Substantially relative to the estimated time of parturition. Prior to parturition, female Mule deer selected gentle south-facing slopes dominated by ponderosa pine Pinus ponderosa and avoided permanent water sources. Parturient females also selected areas used concurrently by elk Cervus elaphus. Following parturition, however, females selected steep north-facing slopes dominated by fir Abies spp., avoided elk and selected habitat located close to permanent water sources. Stage of reproduction clearly influenced choice of habitat by female mule deer. Mule deer management plans should consider potential seasonal variability in the relative importance of forage, risk of predation and competition.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  53     Total Times Cited:  54     Cited Reference Count:  61 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.2981/09-003     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),forage;GPScollars;movement;Odocoileus hemionus;risk of predation;resource selection;timing of parturition;BLACK-TAILED DEER;HABITAT SELECTION;SEXUAL SEGREGATION;FORAGING BEHAVIOR;ALPINE UNGULATE;CERVUS-ELAPHUS;NORTH-AMERICAN;DIMORPHIC DEER;ELK;LACTATION,,

From the predator's perspective, the behavioral responses of the prey in a patch will be perceived as depletion when they retreat to refuge and renewal when they reemerge. A predator encountering responsive prey should manage predation risk, and thus behavioral resource depression, by optimally timing its return time to the patch based on prey behavior. We evaluated the foraging decisions of a predator that encountered patches differing in size of the refuge and prey density. We used little egrets and goldfish as predators and prey in an environment that contained three patches (pools). We manipulated prey density and refuge size and availability (using covers) and observed predator foraging behavior. When the egret had previously caught a fish it did not discriminate between the pools, and the return time was similar for all cover types. The fish densities also did not affect the egret decisions to return to pools. However, when it failed to catch fish, it returned sooner to the pool containing the small cover than the larger one. Additionally, after failing to catch fish in patches containing the highest prey density, the egrets subsequently preferred to return to such patches sooner. We show experimentally that previous failures influence the foraging decisions of a predator choosing how quickly to return to a previously visited patch.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  3     Total Times Cited:  3     Cited Reference Count:  64 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s00442-019-04425-w     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Cover;Foraging;Goldfish;Little egret;Patch;Predation;Prey;Return time;FORAGING GAME;GROUP-SIZE;WAITING GAME;VIGILANCE;STRATEGY;RISK;PREFERENCES;INFORMATION;CHOICE;APPREHENSION;Prednisolone,,

Compared with the predator-prey model without Allee effect, we find that the Allee effect of prey species increases the extinction risk of both predators and prey. When the handling time of predators is relatively short and the Allee effect of prey species becomes strong, both predators and prey may become extinct. Moreover, it is shown that the model with Allee effect undergoes the Hopf bifurcation and heteroclinic bifurcation. The Allee effect of prey species can lead to unstable periodical oscillation. It is also found that the positive equilibrium of the model could change from stable to unstable, and then to stable when the strength of Allee effect or the handling time of predators increases continuously from zero, that is, the model admits stability switches as a parameter changes. When the Allee effect of prey species becomes strong, longer handling time of predators may stabilize the coexistent steady state. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Inc.

To help fill this gap in knowledge, we conducted a literature review, focusing on studies that tested the behavioural and demographic impact of intraguild predation on individuals, populations, and assemblages of diurnal and nocturnal raptorial species. Overall, data were available for 39 empirical and experimental studies on 63 populations belonging to 11 killer species and 15 victim species. An overview of these studies suggested that intraguild predation was a widespread, size-based phenomenon. Results from multiple studies on the same species at different locations were usually consistent across wide geographical areas. Individual-level demographic impacts included reduced site-occupancy, breeding success and survival. Individuals of the prey species responded to predation pressure through direct spatial avoidance, risk-sensitive habitat selection, short-term behavioural avoidance (e.g. reduced vocal activity and escape to refugia after predator detection) and, possibly, temporal segregation. Population-level effects were common but mainly examined as spatio-temporal correlations between the abundance of killer and victim species. Correlative evidence also suggested that intraguild predation may have the potential to structure whole raptor assemblages. More studies on other species and different geographic areas are needed to increase our understanding of the causes and consequences of this widespread interaction. From a conservation point of view, intraguild predation may limit the success of raptor preservation programmes and could be used as a management tool through its effect on mesopredator release and its potentially positive, indirect effects on game species.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  105     Total Times Cited:  115     Cited Reference Count:  99 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/j.1474-919X.2008.00786.x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),birds of prey;competition;interaction;owl;trait-mediated effects;GOSHAWK ACCIPITER-GENTILIS;NORTHERN SPOTTED OWLS;BARRED OWLS;NESTING HABITAT;TOP PREDATORS;INTERSPECIFIC COMPETITION;MESOPREDATOR RELEASE;BREEDING DISPERSAL;FALCO-PEREGRINUS;SITE SELECTION;Prednisolone,,

However, while evidence for such countervailing selection exists for vertebrate color ornaments (e. g., Trinidadian guppies), similar studies have yet to be reported in invertebrates. Indeed, evidence for female mate choice based on extant variation in male coloration is limited in invertebrates, and researchers have not explicitly asked whether more attractive males are also more conspicuous to predators. Here we provide evidence that more chromatic male cabbage white butterflies (Pieris rapae) are more attractive to females but should also be more conspicuous to predators. Female P. rapae preferentially mate with more chromatic males when choosing from populations of males with naturally occurring or commensurate, experimentally induced color variation. Mathematical models of female color vision confirm that females should be able to discriminate color differences between prospective mates. Further, chromatic and luminance contrast scores from female visual system models better predicted male mating success than did measures of male color derived more directly from color spectra. Last, models of avian color vision suggest that preferred males should be more conspicuous to known avian predators.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  64     Total Times Cited:  65     Cited Reference Count:  71 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1086/657043     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),mate choice;sexual selection;Pieris rapae;color vision modeling;color ornament;avian vision;GUPPIES POECILIA-RETICULATA;RED RECEPTORS;STRUCTURAL ULTRAVIOLET;PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS;COLIAS-EURYTHEME;SEXUAL SELECTION;MATING SUCCESS;PIERIS;EVOLUTION;VISION;Color;Prednisolone,,

Indeed, females with offspring are usually more risk adverse than males. Based on a long-term wild boar study, we analysed the diurnal distribution of female and male wild boar before, during and after the hunting period. Hunting, food and foliation were investigated as factors affecting patterns of forest parcel selection. As expected, dense vegetative covers were selected during resting periods, but wild boar decreased this pattern of habitat selection in response to hunting disturbance. Moreover, the habitat selection of wild boar did not fit with the variation of food availability (presence or absence of mast) and the vegetation cycle. As expected, sows responded more to the hunting disturbance than males, leading to a more pronounced sexual difference during the riskier season. The unexpected decrease of bush use may be explained either by the increased hunting effort in this habitat or by the increased movements between resting sites due to disturbance, leading to a more random habitat selection pattern. The observed difference between sexes could result from a higher response of females with offspring to hunting, leading to an increased frequentation of secondary habitats, whereas males can tolerate more risks and remain hidden in thicket plots. Our results highlight how hunting disturbance can lead game species to change their patterns of refuge habitat selection and may affect the habitat segregation between the sexes.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  48     Total Times Cited:  51     Cited Reference Count:  58 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s10344-011-0548-4     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Wild boar;Sus scrofa;Hunting disturbance;Habitat use;Sex effect;SUS-SCROFA;PREDATION-RISK;SEGREGATION;MOVEMENTS;PATTERNS;FOREST;DEER;BEHAVIOR;HUMANS;WOLVES,,

Although it is likely that many species have adapted behaviors to deal with stochastic habitats, there is currently limited evidence of plastic behavior increasing avian fecundity in the wild. Virginia Rails (Rallus limicola) and Soras (Porzana carolina) live in the littoral zones of wetlands that experience high hydrologic variability. During the summers of 2010 and 2011, we tested for the effects of hydrology and behavioral plasticity on the survival of Virginia Rail (n = 75) and Sora (n = 22) nests across 10 wetlands in Maine, USA. We identified the best predictors of both (1) nesting success at individual nests and (2) mean nesting success at the site level, using logistic-exposure models and an information-theoretic approach. Daily nesting survival was 98% for both species, and apparent nest survival was 31 of 85 nests, or 63.5%. Ninety percent of all nesting failures was from predation. Hydrology had a positive effect on nesting survival, and deeper, more variable water levels increased both individual nesting survival and mean site-level nest survival. Both species added material to their nests throughout the season in response to water-level increases, and we found that this behavioral plasticity had a positive effect on nesting survival. We caution that more variable water depths than those observed during our 2 yr of study could lead to increases in flood-related nest loss, because these birds require a delicate balance: the water must be deep enough to deter predators, yet shallow enough that they can build up their nests to prevent flooding during rain events. More information is needed on the extent of this behavior across marsh birds and other bird species.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  10     Total Times Cited:  10     Cited Reference Count:  41 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1642/AUK-14-73.1     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),hydrology;marsh bird;nest building;nest survival;plasticity;Sora;Virginia Rail;wetland;PREDATION RISK;WETLAND;HABITAT;SUCCESS;RAILS;Fertility,,

Both sides of these sensory benefits have long been appreciated, yet less is known of how the perception of events from the perspectives of both prey and predator can interact to influence their encounters. Here we examined how a visual sensory mechanism impacts the collective motion of prey and, subsequently, how their resulting movements influenced predator confusion and capture ability. We presented virtual prey to human players in a targeting game and measured the speed and accuracy with which participants caught designated prey. As prey paid more attention to neighbor movements their collective coordination increased, yet increases in prey coordination were positively associated with increases in the speed and accuracy of attacks. However, while attack speed was unaffected by the initial state of the prey, accuracy dropped significantly if the prey were already organized at the start of the attack, rather than in the process of self-organizing. By repeating attack scenarios and masking the targeted prey's neighbors we were able to visually isolate them and conclusively demonstrate how visual confusion impacted capture ability. Delays in capture caused by decreased coordination amongst the prey depended upon the collection motion of neighboring prey, while it was primarily the motion of the targets themselves that determined capture accuracy. Interestingly, while a complete loss of coordination in the prey (e.g., a flash expansion) caused the greatest delay in capture, such behavior had little effect on capture accuracy. Lastly, while increases in collective coordination in prey enhanced personal risk, traveling in coordinated groups was still better than appearing alone. These findings demonstrate a trade-off between the sensory mechanisms that can enhance the collective properties that emerge in social animals and the individual group member's predation risk during an attack.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  5     Total Times Cited:  5     Cited Reference Count:  59 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004708     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),INFORMATION-TRANSFER;EYE-MOVEMENTS;PURSUIT;PERCEPTION;BEHAVIOR;SMOOTH;INITIATION;VIGILANCE;DYNAMICS;DECISION;Prednisolone,,

Mathematical models: Optimization of trade-offs between predation risk and energy gain.        Key assumption: Foraging individuals choosing to incur higher risk of predation should experience higher energetic gain than individuals choosing safer foraging options.        Organisms: Alaskan harbour seals foraging under predation risk from killer whales and Pacific sleeper sharks in shallow and deep strata, respectively. Sleeper sharks are elusive predators and their interactions with prey are difficult to measure directly.        Method: Our method infers the relative danger from different predator types that is theoretically most plausible according to intermediate consumer behaviour. We predicted net energy gain and predation risk per foraging dive, parameterizing an analytical model with data on seal behaviour and the spatial distributions of predators and resources. We used assumptions about relative danger from different predator types as treatments in a computer experiment. We sought the treatment combination best supporting the assumption that individuals that risk more should gain more by plotting the individual seals' predicted cumulative energy gain against cumulative predation risk. Improved statistical fit for a positive and monotonic relationship implied greater support.        Conclusions: Our key assumption was best supported when assuming that relative danger from sleeper sharks is much greater than that from killer whales, suggesting that sub-lethal effects of sharks on Alaskan harbour seals might be much stronger than previously thought.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  28     Total Times Cited:  29     Cited Reference Count:  31 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",,PRINCE-WILLIAM-SOUND;PACIFIC SLEEPER SHARK;ADULT HARBOR SEALS;DIVING BEHAVIOR;PREDATION RISK;COST;STRATEGIES;MOVEMENTS;DIET;Military Personnel,,

During hunting periods, cervids such as elk (Cervus canadensis) typically select for areas further from roads and closer to tree cover, while altering the timing of their daily activities to avoid hunters. Our objective was to determine the habitat characteristics most influential in predicting harvest risk of elk. We captured 373 female elk between January 2015 and March 2017 in the Uinta-Wasatch-Cache National Forest and surrounding area of central Utah, USA. We determined habitat selection during the hunting season using a resource selection function (RSF) for 255 adult cow elk. Additionally, we used a generalized linear mixed model to evaluate risk of harvest based on habitat use within home ranges (3(rd) order selection) as well as the location of the home range on the landscape to evaluate vulnerability on a broader scale. Female elk selected for areas that reduced hunter access (rugged terrain, within tree cover, on private land). Age, elevation and distance to roads within a home range were most influential in predicting harvest risk (top model accounted for 36.2% of AIC weight). Elevation and distance to trees were most influential in predicting risk when evaluating the location of the home range (top model accounted for 42.1% of AIC weight). Vulnerability to harvest was associated with proximity to roads. Additionally, survival in our landscape decreased with age of femaleelk.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  1     Total Times Cited:  1     Cited Reference Count:  53 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1371/journal.pone.0242841     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),RESOURCE SELECTION;YELLOWSTONE ELK;CASCADE RANGE;HUNTER ACCESS;MULE DEER;PREDATION;MOVEMENT;RISK;DISTRIBUTIONS;LANDSCAPE,,

Historically, the demographic benefits of such movements made migration common, but in many taxa the phenomenon is considered globally threatened. Here we describe a long-term decline in the productivity of elk (Cervus elaphus) that migrate through intact wilderness areas to protected summer ranges inside Yellowstone National Park, USA. We attribute this decline to a long-term reduction in the demographic benefits that ungulates typically gain from migration. Among migratory elk, we observed a 21-year, 70% reduction in recruitment and a 4-year, 19% depression in their pregnancy rate largely caused by infrequent reproduction of females that were young or lactating. In contrast, among resident elk, we have recently observed increasing recruitment and a high rate of pregnancy. Landscape-level changes in habitat quality and predation appear to be responsible for the declining productivity of Yellowstone migrants. From 1989 to 2009, migratory elk experienced an increasing rate and shorter duration of green-up coincident with warmer spring-summer temperatures and reduced spring precipitation, also consistent with observations of an unusually severe drought in the region. Migrants are also now exposed to four times as many grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) and wolves (Canis lupus) as resident elk. Both of these restored predators consume migratory elk calves at high rates in the Yellowstone wilderness but are maintained at low densities via lethal management and human disturbance in the year-round habitats of resident elk. Our findings suggest that large-carnivore recovery and drought, operating simultaneously along an elevation gradient, have disproportionately influenced the demography of migratory elk. Many migratory animals travel large geographic distances between their seasonal ranges. Changes in land use and climate that disparately influence such seasonal ranges may alter the ecological basis of migratory behavior, representing an important challenge for, and a powerful lens into, the ecology and conservation of migratory taxa.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  148     Total Times Cited:  151     Cited Reference Count:  61 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1890/11-2298.1     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),carnivore recovery;Cervus elaphus;drought;elk;grizzly bears;migration;trophic mismatch;vegetation phenology;wolves;Yellowstone;UNGULATE POPULATION-DYNAMICS;LONG-DISTANCE MIGRATION;CLIMATE-CHANGE;PLANT PHENOLOGY;TROPHIC CASCADE;CALF SURVIVAL;RISK;DECLINES;REPRODUCTION;WOLVES;Animals;Animal Shells;Prednisolone,,

Similar bonds can be found in a wide range of taxa, revealing the evolutionary origins of humans' social bonds. Evidence suggests that these strong social bonds can function to buffer the negative effects of living in groups, but it is not known whether they also function to minimize predation risk. Here, we show that crested macaques (Macaca nigra) react more strongly to playbacks of recruitment alarm calls (i.e. calls signalling the presence of a predator and eliciting cooperative mobbing behaviour) if they were produced by an individual with whom they share a strong social bond. Dominance relationships between caller and listener had no effect on the reaction of the listener. Thus, strong social bonds may improve the coordination and efficiency of cooperative defence against predators, and therefore increase chances of survival. This result broadens our understanding of the evolution and function of social bonds by highlighting their importance in the anti-predator context.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  54     Total Times Cited:  54     Cited Reference Count:  66 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1098/rspb.2012.1470     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),anti-predator behaviour;primate communication;social bond;cooperation;alarm calls;relationship quality;ALARM CALLS;VOCAL COMMUNICATION;AGE-DIFFERENCES;RECONCILIATION;FRIENDSHIPS;CHIMPANZEES;AGGRESSION;PREDATION;SULAWESI;FEMALES;Prednisolone,,

Sentinel interchanges often appear orderly and the number of sentinels changes little despite the turnover of individuals. I modeled why solitary individuals or group members might take up prominent positions. Such positions can be safe places to rest because they provide a good view of approaching predators, even if undetected predators preferentially attack sentinels. In pairs, coordinated sentinel behavior is favored whenever information spreads from a detecting to a non-detecting individual more than half the time. Under these conditions, safety for a sentinel produces safety for a forager as a by-product. Thus sentinel behavior occurs for selfish safety reasons but coordination of sentinels is based on mutualism. If sentinels can coordinate their individual actions, evidence of the game is hidden from view. The fitness consequences of some games may be best indicated by the strategies organisms take to avoid playing them.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  33     Total Times Cited:  35     Cited Reference Count:  31 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",,ANTIPREDATORY VIGILANCE;COLLECTIVE DETECTION;BEHAVIOR;RISK;COOPERATION;PREDATION;BASICS;BIRDS;BACK,,

The antipredator response may influence spatial pattern formation and ecosystem stability but requires an organism's cost to contribute to the collective effort. We investigate a nonhierarchical tritrophic system, whose predator-prey interactions are described by the rock-paper-scissors game rules. In our spatial stochastic simulations, the radius of antipredator response defines the maximum prey group size that disturbs the predator's action, determining the individual cost to participate in antipredator strategies. We consider that each organism contributes equally to the collective effort, having its mobility limited by the proportion of energy devoted to the antipredator reaction. Our outcomes show that the antipredator response leads to spiral patterns, with the segregation of organisms of the same species occupying departed spatial domains. We found that a less localized antipredator response increases the average size of the single-species patches, improving the protection of individuals against predation. Finally, our findings show that although the increase of the predation risk for a more localized antipredator response, the high mobility constraining benefits species coexistence. Our results may help ecologists understand the mechanisms leading to the stability of biological systems where locality is crucial to behavioral interactions among species.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  2     Total Times Cited:  2     Cited Reference Count:  47 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1103/PhysRevE.104.054201     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),GROUP-SIZE;SPIDER-MITES;PREDATION;BIODIVERSITY;VIGILANCE;PATTERNS;BEHAVIOR;RISK;STRATEGIES;PROMOTES,,

We examined how sea lice infestation affects predation risk and mortality of juvenile pink (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) and chum (O. keta) salmon, and developed a mathematical model to assess the implications for population dynamics and conservation. A risk-taking experiment indicated that infected juvenile pink salmon accept a higher predation risk in order to obtain foraging opportunities. In a schooling experiment with juvenile chum salmon, infected individuals had increased nearest-neighbor distances and occupied peripheral positions in the school. Prey selection experiments with cutthroat trout (O. clarkii) predators indicated that infection reduces the ability of juvenile pink salmon to evade a predatory strike. Group predation experiments with coho salmon (O. kisutch) feeding on juvenile pink or chum salmon indicated that predators selectively consume infected prey. The experimental results indicate that lice may increase the rate of prey capture but not the handling time of a predator. Based on this result, we developed a mathematical model of sea lice and salmon population dynamics in which parasitism affects the attack rate in a type II functional response. Analysis of the model indicates that: (1) the estimated mortality of wild juvenile salmon due to sea lice infestation is probably higher than previously thought; (2) predation can cause a simultaneous decline in sea louse abundance on wild fish and salmon productivity that could mislead managers and regulators; and (3) compensatory mortality occurs in the saturation region of the type II functional response where prey are abundant because predators increase mortality of parasites but not overall predation rates. These findings indicate that predation is an important component of salmon-louse dynamics and has implications for estimating mortality, reducing infection, and developing conservation policy.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  53     Total Times Cited:  53     Cited Reference Count:  50 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1890/09-1861.1     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),aquaculture;behavior;fish farms;Lepeophtheirus salmonis;Oncorhynchus spp.;parasites;population dynamics;predation;salmon;sea lice;SEA LICE;LEPEOPHTHEIRUS-SALMONIS;SELECTIVE PREDATION;ATLANTIC SALMON;JUVENILE PINK;CHUM SALMON;PACIFIC SALMON;BEHAVIOR;INFECTIONS;PRODUCTIVITY;Prednisolone,,

We begin by providing the first critical review of this emerging literature, which shows that real-world events provide emotional shocks that are at least as strong as what can ethically be induced under laboratory conditions. However, we also find that most previous quasi-field experiment studies use statistical techniques that may result in biased estimates. We propose a more statistically-robust approach, and illustrate it using an experiment on negative emotion and risk-taking, in which sports fans completed risk-elicitation tasks immediately after watching a series of NFL games.

To investigate the potential mechanisms by which differential displacement of the native topminnow species may have occurred, biotic interactions and spatial distribution of both conspecific and heterospecific groups of plains topminnow, plains killifish, and western mosquitofish were quantified in microcosms for three life stages (larval, juvenile, and adult). Interactions between adult western mosquitofish and the native species were complex and dependent upon life stage, but collectively suggested that populations of both plains topminnow and plains killifish are vulnerable to mosquitofish establishment. Detrimental effects towards fundulid species were primarily mediated through predation of larvae and aggressive interactions directed towards juvenile life stages which caused significant mortality. In addition, simultaneous alterations of behavior, as quantified by activity patterns and microhabitat use, were apparent in both native species in response to western mosquitofish presence. Because similar impacts of western mosquitofish were observed for plains killifish and plains topminnow, the persistence of plains killifish in areas occupied by western mosquitofish may be linked to species attributes not assessed in the current analysis. Subtle differences in microhabitat selection between the topminnow species and adult western mosquitofish could potentially explain observed differential displacement in the environment. These results have augmented our understanding of the impacts that western mosquitofish has on the at-risk plains topminnow, and have further elucidated the potential mechanisms for impact via competitive interactions.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  5     Total Times Cited:  7     Cited Reference Count:  40 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.3391/ai.2015.10.3.09     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),species displacement;competition;invasive species;aggressive interactions;western mosquitofish;plains topminnow;plains killifish;ENDANGERED SONORAN TOPMINNOW;BARRENS TOPMINNOWS;PLAINS TOPMINNOW;MOSQUITOFISH;FISH;PREDATION;COEXISTENCE;MANAGEMENT;SURVIVAL;DRAINAGE,,

For example, an animal may reduce activity in response to stress related to increased predation risk, but this response carries the potential cost of missed foraging or mating opportunities. We used laboratory bioassays to determine whether Ozark zigzag salamanders, Plethodon angusticlavius, decreased their feeding behavior following increased levels of threat-related stress. Stress level was manipulated in three experiments where salamanders were exposed to direct or indirect indicators of stress. The direct cue was a physical attack. The indirect cues were chemical cues from distressed conspecifics and chemical cues (""kairomones"") from predatory ringneck snakes, Diadophis punctatus. For all three cues, stressed salamanders showed lower foraging success than unstressed salamanders. The physical attack did not result in a more intense response than the other treatments, possibly because the attack occurred away from the foraging area. The intensity of the response to stress may depend more on the nature of the threat (identity and imminence) than the level of physical disturbance. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Predator cues also elicit antipredator responses, and previous research indicates that prey possess mechanisms to discriminate between the relative risk posed by particular predator cues, which mediates their investment in antipredator behaviors (i.e., Bthreatsensitive"" behavior). However, the salience of such predator cues may change according to perceived predation risk, which can vary temporally or spatially. We hypothesized that prey modify responses to predatory cues according to their recent experience with predators, which would prime prey to attend to predator-related cues. In the present study, we found that recent encounters with live tethered rattlesnakes increased perceived predation risk in free-ranging California ground squirrels (Otospermophilus beecheyi), leading to concomitant increases in the intensity of antipredator behaviors displayed toward a predator model. The increase in antipredator behavior following snake encounters was higher toward the predator model than a novel object, suggesting that squirrels exhibit threat-sensitive responses toward objects resembling predators. However, squirrels did not treat either of these objects with caution, nor did they differ in antipredator behavior, when presented with the model or novel object when no live snake was encountered. This suggests that increased vigilance following predator encounters modulates responses to predator cues. Such increases in antipredator behavior could assist in detecting nearby predators quickly but could also have indirect effects on prey.        Significance statement        Underresponding to predators could lead to death, while overresponding could reduce time spent on other fitnessrelated activities. Prey balance these costs by using environmental cues to modify antipredator responses. Detecting a live predator in the environment could indicate that the chance of predation is high, which may enhance preys' antipredator responses. We show that ground squirrels significantly enhance antipredator behaviors toward snake models and novel objects after encountering a live tethered rattlesnake predator. However, the predator model elicited greater antipredator behavior than the novel object following snake encounters, suggesting that squirrels are primed to attend to predator-related cues in this context. Both objects were treated similarly, and with less caution, when no snake was detected. Vigilance following predator interactions therefore mediates threatsensitive responses to subsequent predator cues.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  8     Total Times Cited:  8     Cited Reference Count:  73 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s00265-017-2378-1     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Antipredator;Novelty;Perceptual priming;Predator recognition;Threat-sensitive;Vigilance;ANTIPREDATOR BEHAVIOR;FORAGING BEHAVIOR;OTOSPERMOPHILUS-BEECHEYI;VISUAL-SEARCH;HUNTING MODE;GROUP-SIZE;CALIFORNIA;VIGILANCE;RISK;RESPONSES;Cues;Prednisolone,,

We investigated sex differences in mother-calf distance, calf activity levels, and calf mortality in a semi-domesticated reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) population. The results show that male calves stray farther away from their mothers, exhibit a higher level of locomotive behavior in terms of play and walking, and are more vulnerable to predation than are female calves.

The loss of unique members of such radiations undermines their collective evolutionary potential, as well as the ability of scientists to compare divergent populations, thereby devaluing the entire radiation as a system of study. To illustrate our case, we consider the adaptive radiation of the threespine stickleback fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus) in light of anthropogenic threats. Specifically, we consider the effects of stocking with rainbow trout, Onchorynchus mykiss, on populations of stickleback in lakes of two types in the Cook Inlet Region of Alaska, USA: (1) those in which salmonids are native and (2) those historically devoid of predatory fish. Many populations in this second class exhibit reduced pelvic armor that is, in part, a consequence of the historical absence of piscine predators that prey upon stickleback. Long-term trapping data from 77 lakes show that stocking in lakes where trout are not native is associated with large fluctuations in stickleback abundance, relative to lakes in which trout are native, or to lakes in which trout are neither native nor stocked. Pelvic-reduced populations appear to be at most risk from stocking. We discuss how these populations have responded to, and may yet respond to such threats, and how the information we have on these populations can be used to identify evolutionarily significant units (ESUs: Ryder, 1986), and certainly, distinct populations segments (DPSs: Green, 2005; Moritz, 2002; Waples, 1991) deemed worthy of protection under Section 3(15) of the 1973 US Endangered Species Act as amended in 1978.

Such strategies may arise when timing of return visits is important, for instance to allow for resource renewal or territorial patrolling. We fitted spatially explicit random-walk models to GPS movement data of six wolves (Canis lupus; Linnaeus, 1758) from Alberta, Canada to investigate the importance of the following: (1) territorial surveillance likely related to renewal of scent marks along territorial edges, to reduce intraspecific risk among packs, and (2) delay in return to recently hunted areas, which may be related to anti-predator responses of prey under varying prey densities. The movement models incorporated the spatiotemporal variable time since last visit, which acts as a wolf's memory index of its travel history and is integrated into the movement decision along with its position in relation to territory boundaries and information on local prey densities. We used a model selection framework to test hypotheses about the combined importance of these variables in wolf movement strategies. Time-dependent movement for territory surveillance was supported by all wolf movement tracks. Wolves generally avoided territory edges, but this avoidance was reduced as time since last visit increased. Time-dependent prey management was weak except in one wolf. This wolf selected locations with longer time since last visit and lower prey density, which led to a longer delay in revisiting high prey density sites. Our study shows that we can use spatially explicit random walks to identify behavioral strategies that merge environmental information and explicit spatiotemporal information on past movements (i.e., when and where) to make movement decisions. The approach allows us to better understand cognition-based movement in relation to dynamic environments and resources.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  19     Total Times Cited:  20     Cited Reference Count:  84 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1002/ece3.3176     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),animal movement;cognition;GPS data;landscape of fear;movement ecology;predator-prey;spatial memory;step selection;territoriality;time since last visit;BIALOWIEZA-PRIMEVAL-FOREST;EPISODIC-LIKE MEMORY;SPATIAL MEMORY;CANIS-LUPUS;ANIMAL MOVEMENT;SPATIOTEMPORAL DYNAMICS;ANTIPREDATOR RESPONSE;RESOURCE SELECTION;WOODLAND CARIBOU;NATIONAL-PARK,,

We argue that an 'I see you' signal has coevolved between the Asian hive bee, Apis cerana, and its hornet predator, Vespa velutina. When a hornet approaches a bee colony, guards perform a shaking movement that repels the hornet. To test whether this is an 'I see you' display, we exposed colonies to free-flying and tethered hornets and tethered butterflies. The intensity of the shaking was correlated with the hornet's proximity, whereas guard bees barely responded to a nonthreatening butterfly. The signal is likely to be honest, because the bees can kill the hornet by collective mobbing if it lands on the entrance. The Western honeybee, Apis mellifera, which has not evolved in the presence of Asian hornets, does not produce the signal and is ineffective at killing hornets by collective mobbing. We also found that hornets were more successful at catching A. mellifera than A. cerana bees at the hive entrance. (C) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Under such circumstances, fitness of a genotype (or 'strategy') is defined as the geometric mean of the intergenerational genotypic population growth rate l(t).  Unfortunately, this population-level criterion has proved difficult to apply at the level of individual organisms.        After developing a formula for the variance of l as the sum of developmental and environmental variance, we discuss several models of individual adaptations, involving clutch size, progeny size and number, and foraging behaviour under risk of predation, based on the geometric-mean fitness concept.  We then show how the method of dynamic programming can be extended to deal with facultative behaviour in stochastic environments.  Finally we discuss the concept of an evolutionarily stable strategy in a stochastic environment.        Our analysis suggests several novel interpretations of field and laboratory observations.  Under the geometric mean criterion behaviour may be determined primarily by the worst likely environment; behaviour may appear suboptimal if observed only under normal or average conditions.  For example, except under extreme environmental conditions, avian clutches larger than those that are observed might result in increased fecundity, with little if any cost of reproduction in terms of parental survival; however, in unusually bad years such large clutches might be disastrous, in terms of parental survival.  This consideration may help explain some recently reported experimental clutch-size manipulation results.  Similarly, our analysis indicates that the known phenomenon of seasonal reduction in seed size may constitute a double bet-hedging strategy, determined by parental mortality risk and future seed survival probability.  We also discuss circumstances in which phenotypic polymorphism is an adaptation to environmental uncertainty.  Thus almost any individual life history or behavioural adaptation may be affected by environmental stochasticity.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  98     Total Times Cited:  98     Cited Reference Count:  0 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/BF02270833     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),ADAPTATIONS;STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENTS;FITNESS;GEOMETRIC MEAN;BEHAVIOR;DYNAMIC MODELING;ESS;PHENOTYPIC POLYMORPHISM;CLUTCH SIZE;PROGENY SIZE;FORAGING UNDER PREDATION RISK,,

Some members of the scorpion genus Parabuthus (family Buthidae) can spray their venom. We examined the stimulus control and characteristics of venom spraying by Parabuthus transvaalicus to better understand the behavioral context for its use. Venom spraying occurred mostly, but not always, when the metasoma (tail) was contacted (usually grasped by forceps), and was absent during stinging-like thrusts of the metasoma apart from contact. Scorpions were significantly more likely to spray when contact was also accompanied by airborne stimuli. Sprays happened almost instantaneously following grasping by forceps (median = 0.23 s) as a brief (0.07-0.30 s, mean = 0.18 s), fine stream (<5 degrees arc) that was not directed toward the stimulus source; however, rapid independent movements of the metasoma and/or telson (stinger) often created a more diffuse spray, increasing the possibility of venom contact with the sensitive eyes of potential scorpion predators. Successive venom sprays varied considerably in duration and velocity. Collectively, these results suggest that venom spraying might be useful as an antipredator function and can be modulated based on threat. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In a spatially explicit group, foragers with high vigilance can shift the burden of predation to their less vigilant companions if they escape first and the predator selects laggards preferentially. I refer to this as the pass-along effect on vigilance. In a series of models, I examine changes in ESS (evolutionarily stable strategy) levels of vigilance as a function of initial distance between foragers. In a group with peripheral foragers, vigilance first decreases and then increases with decreases in the initial distance between foragers. The decrease in vigilance arises because the foragers occur further away from the predator and have a greater head start when escaping. However, as foragers occur closer to each other, the risk of being overtaken by companions increases and favours higher vigilance. This increase in vigilance with group density also occurs for centrally located foragers that are not exposed directly to attack but which can be overtaken by peripheral companions. When all foragers in a group are alerted instantaneously by the escape of companions, the relative position of prey in the group cannot change, impeding the pass-along effect.

This point can be assumed as a clear proof of the importance of studying such problems from various aspects such as computational mathematical models. In this contribution, we examine a mathematical model to investigate the prevalence of an infectious disease in a prey and predator system, including three subpopulations through a fractional system of nonlinear equations. The model characterizes a possible interaction between predator and prey where infectious disease outbreaks in a community. Further, the prey population is divided into two: susceptible and the infected population. This model involves the Caputo-Fabrizio derivative. One of the basic features of this type of derivative is the use of a non-singular (exponential) kernel, which increases its ability to describe phenomena compared to other existing operators. To the best of the author's knowledge, the use of fractional derivative operators for this model has not yet been investigated. Therefore, the presented results can be considered as new and interesting results for this model. In some of the acquired simulations, the chaotic behaviors are clearly detectable.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  26     Total Times Cited:  26     Cited Reference Count:  22 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1002/mma.7386     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),chaotic behaviors;infectious diseases;numerical techniques;the Caputo&#8208;Fabrizio fractional derivative;Prevalence;Communicable Diseases;Prednisolone,,

Consequently, to escape from predators they usually adopt several defense mechanisms, specially refuge themselves to become invulnerable. In view of this, a mathematical model has been formulated incorporating prey refuge, where it is assumed that prey refuge is a function of predators availability in the system. It is shown that the model system is well-posed. It has been found that the hiding level and consumption rate of predators have a suitable interrelation between them. Both the parameters act as Hopf bifurcation parameters, but they play opposite role in case of stabilization of the system dynamics. Also, hiding level plays crucial role in maintaining the mean density of both the populations. Furthermore, as hiding behaviour of prey is not instantaneous, so a time delay, namely hiding delay has been introduced to make the model system more realistic and it is observed that the delay parameter destabilizes the system. Modelling approach through fractional calculus has been further deployed to study how the process of forgetting life history influences the dynamical intricacy of the population level dynamics. All the analytical findings have been testified by proper numerical performances.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  75 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.ecoinf.2021.101483     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Camouflage;Hiding behaviour;Hopf-bifurcation;Hiding delay;Caputo derivative;Fading memory;JATROPHA-CURCAS;BIFURCATION-ANALYSIS;MATHEMATICAL-MODEL;ANIMAL CAMOUFLAGE;HOPF-BIFURCATION;MOSAIC DISEASE;STABILITY;DYNAMICS;REFUGE;IMPACT;Prednisolone,,

Using the vomeronasal organ, these salamanders can assess chemical cues in their environment, including cues from predators and alarm secretions from conspecific and heterospecific salamanders. Ozark zigzag salamanders live syntopically with earthworms which are abundant and vulnerable to the same predators. We tested whether salamanders would respond to alarm secretion from earthworms in ways that are consistent with antipredator behaviour. We obtained alarm secretions from earthworms by simulating a predator attack (grasping them with forceps) and collecting the stimuli in water. When exposed to alarm secretions, salamanders increased their time spent in escape behaviour, decreased their chemosensory behaviour, and increased oxygen consumption, whereas their responses to stimuli from unstressed earthworms were similar to their responses to blank water. Our results suggest that Ozark zigzag salamanders recognize alarm secretions from earthworms as dangerous because of their ecological similarity.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  6     Total Times Cited:  6     Cited Reference Count:  66 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1080/03949370.2013.800162     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Ozark zigzag salamander;Plethodon angusticlavius;prey guild;alarm secretion;earthworm;predation risk;MINNOWS PIMEPHALES-PROMELAS;RED-BACKED SALAMANDERS;CHEMICAL CUES;FATHEAD MINNOWS;TERRESTRIAL SALAMANDERS;POPULATION DIFFERENCES;GRAYBELLY SALAMANDERS;AGONISTIC BEHAVIOR;FORAGING BEHAVIOR;PREDATION RISK,,

It is known that antipredator and antiparasite defense can be mutually conflicting, however consequences of this trade-off for the regulation of infection burden in animals are still poorly understood. We hypothesize that even in the absence of cues from predators, innate antipredator behavior (""ghost of predation past"") interferes with defense against parasites and can enhance the infection risk. As a case study, we explore interactions between a commercial species, the rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss, and its parasite, the trematode eye-fluke Diplostomum pseudospathaceum. Fish-parasite interactions were tested in compartmentalized tanks where shelters and parasites were presented in different combinations providing various conditions for microhabitat choice and territorial behavior. Shelters were attractive and contestable despite the absence of predators and presence of parasites. The individuals fighting for shelters acquired more than twice the number of cercariae as compared to those in infected shelter-free compartments. Most infected were subordinate fish with a higher ventilation rate. Fish possessing shelters were less vulnerable to parasites than fighting fish. Grouping reduced the infection load, although less efficiently than sheltering. Our data demonstrate that the innate antipredator behavior can undermine antiparasite tactics of the fish and result in higher infection rates. Using our empirical results, we construct a mathematical model which predicts that enriching the environment in fish farming will be beneficial only when a large number of shelters is provided. Using insufficient number of shelters will increase the parasite burden in the fish.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  4     Total Times Cited:  4     Cited Reference Count:  82 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1093/beheco/arz188     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),behavioral tactics;Diplostomum pseudospathaceum;enriched habitat;fish parasites;innate antipredator behavior;sustainable aquaculture;REARING ENVIRONMENT;DIPLOSTOMUM-SPATHACEUM;AVOIDANCE-BEHAVIOR;ATLANTIC SALMON;INDUCED STRESS;EYE FLUKE;HOST;PARASITES;ECOLOGY;DISEASE;Prednisolone,,

During 1999-2003, we evaluated the efficacy of prescribed burning, felling, and shearblading (with and without debris removal) to regenerate quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides). Treatments were conducted largely during the dormant period for aspen: prescribed burns in mid-May and mechanical treatments in late August through early April. Prescribed burns on loess hills produced 40,900-233,000 stems/ho by the second growing season. Low relative humidity, slope of more than 100, southerly aspect, and juxtaposition to open areas produced fire behavior adequate to ensure top killing and vigorous sprouting response. Felling by chainsaw on loess hills produced 34,800-89,800 stems/ho, whereas dozer shearblading on glacial outwash (loam over gravel) produced 74,200-209,200 stems/ha (cleared portions and windrows combined) and a sandy loam floodplain produced 31,400-64,800 stems/ha.

Large herbivores are distributed differently on the landscape and therefore have different vulnerabilities as prey for lions. For instance, blue wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus) occupy small grazing lawns at night but are difficult for lions to capture because open areas lack cover for stalking. African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) aggregate in large herds but are less available because these herds only intermittently enter the home ranges of individual lion prides. Unlike large herds of wildebeest and buffalo, plains zebra (Equus quagga) move widely in small herds while browsing greater kudus (Tragelaphus strepsiceros) and giraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis giraffa) generally occur in lower densities. We used spatial data derived from GPS collars to investigate several hypotheses regarding the movements of three lion prides in response to their prey. We found that lions were most active and moved longer distances during nighttime than during daytime. Lions remained within their core home ranges on 87% of nights and wandered to the outlying areas of the home ranges every second night. Lions visited grazing lawns, that is, area of short grass, where wildebeest herds resided every second night, and moved toward the direction of buffalo herds within 2 km of vicinity. Lions spent more time near riverbanks that provided dense woody cover at night than expected but concentrated only weakly near sites with surface water where herbivores drank in the dry season. Our study contributes to understanding how lions vary their movements in response to the spatial and temporal heterogeneity in the relative availability and vulnerability of multiple prey species.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  41 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1093/jmammal/gyac025     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),independent mixture model;Kruger National Park;landscape of fear;movement behavior;Panthera leo;predation;ACTIVITY PATTERNS;WATER DEPENDENCY;NATIONAL-PARK;HABITAT USE;SAVANNA;HERBIVORE;MOVEMENTS;PREDATION;SELECTION;SUCCESS,,

Information-sharing (IS) and; producer-scrounger (PS) games predict different joining frequencies because they make distinct assumptions about food searching. IS games assume individuals can search concurrently for finding and joining opportunities while PS games assume incompatible search modes; individuals search either as a producer, detecting only finding opportunities, or as a scrounger, detecting only joining opportunities; To determine the search assumption for flocks of ground-feeding granivores we studied the behaviour of spice finches, Lonchura punctulata, foraging in indoor aviaries for clumps of hidden millet seed. We looked for behaviour patterns preceding finding and joining events. An analysis of covariance showed that the frequencies of hopping with the head pointing up and down were statistically associated with the frequencies of a bird's joining and finding, respectively. When the expected stable frequency of the scrounger tactic was altered by changing the seed distribution, the birds' relative frequency of hopping with the head up changed accordingly When the seed distribution made any use of the scrounger tactic unprofitable, the frequency of hopping with the head up declined to zero. Consequently, in ground-feeding birds such as spice finches, finding and joining behaviour conform more closely to the assumptions of a PS rather than an IS game.

Less appreciated is the potential for site-specific changes in drivers with the advent of anthropogenic alteration of predator-prey relationships, including apex predator restoration and spread of invasive predators. Particularly interesting is the relative impact of climate and biotic interactions on population performance when these conflict. In this 31-year study (1990-2020), we revisit a common eider Somateria mollissima population from SW Finland, Baltic Sea, fifteen years on from an earlier study showing that climate warming positively affected reproductive parameters and performance. However, the population is simultaneously exposed to increasing predation by the rapidly recovering native apex predator and invasive mammals. Based on the current population trend, we predicted 1) a weakening of the previously documented positive effects of a warming climate on vital rates, 2) intensified predation and 3) increasing top-down control of vital rates and accompanying population decline. Five out of seven breeding parameters (annual spread in female body condition, breeding phenology and synchrony, interval between arrival and breeding, fledgling production) were best explained by predation indices, whereas climate signals (winter NAO, Baltic Sea maximum ice cover) on breeding parameters have weakened. Particularly intriguing is that the previous positive association between mild ice winters and subsequent reproductive output has disappeared during the past 15 years, highlighting the non-linear nature of climate change responses. Indirect predation effects (selective disappearance, changed reproductive strategies, nest-site selection and population age distribution) can potentially explain also the remaining breeding parameters (annual mean body condition and clutch size). The observed regime shift in predation risk appears to prevent this now endangered population from reaping the potential benefits of a warming climate.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  1     Total Times Cited:  1     Cited Reference Count:  70 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/oik.08762     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),anthropogenic predation facilitation;antipredator behaviour;biotic interaction strength;climate forcing;predator-prey;reproductive success;PREDATION RISK;SOMATERIA-MOLLISSIMA;BODY CONDITION;SHIFTS;CONSEQUENCES;TEMPERATURES;STRATEGIES;LANDSCAPE;SYNCHRONY;RESPONSES,,

Our study was conducted at Tall Timbers Research Station, Tallahassee, FL, USA-situated in a landscape subjected to small scale (<20 ha) prescribed fires on a 2-year fire rotation. We predicted prescribed fire, disking, and supplemental feeding would dictate resource use, but effects would depend on time since fire, brood age, and time of day. We predicted vegetation and temperature would govern roost use by broods, but these effects would also depend on age. We radio-tracked 62 broods 21-35 times / week during May-October 2018 and 2019. Broods were less likely to use areas with large proportions of hardwood drains but favored sites with greater proportions of burned uplands, regardless of the time of day. Broods were less likely to use areas at greater distances from supplemental feed; this relationship had no interaction with age but was stronger later in the nesting season (>July 15). Broods were more likely to use areas with greater proportions of fallow fields during the day than for roosting. Broods used roosts with more woody cover and visual obscurity than at available sites. Roosts consisted of less grass and bare ground. However, these effects interacted with age; broods used sparser cover at older ages. Neonate broods were more likely to use cooler roosts with greater thermal stability, but this effect was reversed for juveniles. Broods may alter resource use with changes in vulnerabilities to threats such as thermal risks and predation.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  93 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1002/ece3.8161     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Colinus virginianus;prescribed fire;resource use;supplemental feeding;temperature;trade-offs;HABITAT USE;MICROHABITAT SELECTION;PREDATION RISK;SURVIVAL;BEHAVIOR;BIRDS;ROOST,,

Factors eliciting displacement and the nutritional consequences of behavioral changes were measured. GPS collars were deployed to track temporal and spatial resource use and scan and focal observations were used to quantify foraging efficiency, Vigilance behavior, and bear use of various food resources. Total food intake was quantified by combining data on food resource use based on GPS locations and foraging efficiency was measured using spotting scopes from long distances. Seasonal food availability and quality were monitored and utilized as co-variates in comparisons between pre-treatment and treatment years. Though the bear population exhibited significant behavioral differences between the presence and absence of humans, changes in behavior generally mediated effects on total food intake. Adult males at a salt marsh viewing area were the only sex/age class exhibiting reduced food intake resulting from a 15% decline in foraging time when viewers were present. Salmon intake did not differ between pre-treatment and treatment years despite a 10% decline in time spent fishing when viewers were present. The tightly controlled experimental bear-viewing introduced in this study allowed bears to evaluate predation risk associated with human activity and optimally respond to minimize costs due to changes in foraging activities.

Only 6.4% of all agonistic events were over food patches and no significant correlation was found between a female's dominance rank and proportion of time spent feeding, feeding bout length or diet composition. Parameters of reproductive success, such as inter-birth intervals and infant mortality were not correlated with female dominance rank. Female mortality, however, was related to dominance rank and all of the five females who disappeared during the study were low-ranking. Four of the five females disappeared after troop fission. There is circumstantial evidence supporting the suggestion that predation by leopards is the main cause of mortality of females at Mkuzi. High levels of female aggression were recorded, with almost no occurrences of support coalitions. Most of the aggression took place among similar ranking females, or was directed by the top ranking toward the lowest ranking females. Most of the female-to-female agonistic encounters were in a social context, and more than half were over a spatial position next to other adult troop members. Aggression among females increased after troop fission. It is suggested that the higher-ranking females may be better protected from predation, through access to more central spatial positions in the troop. Indeed, a positive correlation was found between a female's dominance rank and the time spent next to other adult troop members. It may be that avoiding food competition by keeping larger distances from others, while foraging, was translated in lower ranking females to a cost of higher predation risk.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  64     Total Times Cited:  65     Cited Reference Count:  39 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1163/156853996X00549     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),baboons;Papio cynocephalus ursinus;dominance hierarchy;predation;female competition;spatial position;SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS;MACACA-FASCICULARIS;PAPIO-CYNOCEPHALUS;OLIVE BABOONS;MACAQUES;TROOP;RANK;Papio,,

Despite its prevalence, the drivers of caching behaviour, and its impacts on individuals, remain poorly understood, particularly for short-term food cachers. Leopards Panthera pardus exhibit a unique form of short-term food caching, regularly hoisting, storing and consuming prey in trees. We explored the factors motivating such behaviour among leopards in the Sabi Sand Game Reserve, South Africa, associated with four not mutually exclusive hypotheses: food-perishability, consumption-time, resource-pulse and kleptoparasitism-avoidance. Using data from 2032 prey items killed by 104 leopards from 2013 to 2015, we built generalized linear mixed models to examine how hoisting behaviour, feeding time and the likelihood of a kill being kleptoparasitized varied with leopard sex and age, prey size and vulnerability, vegetation, elevation, climate, and the immediate and long-term risk posed by dominant competitors. Leopards hoisted 51% of kills. They were more likely to hoist kills of an intermediate size, outside of a resource pulse and in response to the presence of some competitors. Hoisted kills were also fed on for longer than non-hoisted kills. At least 21% of kills were kleptoparasitized, mainly by spotted hyaenas Crocuta crocuta. Kills were more likely to be kleptoparasitized at lower temperatures and if prey were larger, not hoisted, and in areas where the risk of encountering hyaenas was greatest. Female leopards that suffered higher rates of kleptoparasitism exhibited lower annual reproductive success than females that lost fewer kills. Our results strongly support the kleptoparasitism-avoidance hypothesis and suggest hoisting is a key adaptation that enables leopards to coexist sympatrically with high densities of competitors. We further argue that leopards may select smaller-sized prey than predicted by optimal foraging theory, to balance trade-offs between kleptoparasitic losses and the energetic gains derived from killing larger prey. Although caching may provide the added benefits of delaying food perishability and enabling consumption over an extended period, the behaviour primarily appears to be a strategy for leopards, and possibly other short-term cachers, to reduce the risks of kleptoparasitism.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  41     Total Times Cited:  42     Cited Reference Count:  63 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/1365-2656.12654     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),competition;consumption time;food perishability;kleptoparasitism avoidance;optimal foraging;Panthera pardus;resource pulse;short-term caching;spotted hyaena;PREY SIZE;CROCUTA-CROCUTA;PANTHERA-PARDUS;HANDLING TIME;COMPETITION;PREDATION;ECOLOGY;DETERMINES;EVOLUTION;CARCASSES,,

Theory predicts that spatial and temporal scales should co-vary in most ecological processes and that the most limiting factors should drive habitat selection at coarse ecological scales, but be less influential at finer scales. Using detailed location data on roe deer Capreolus capreolus inhabiting the Bavarian Forest National Park, Germany, we investigated habitat selection at several spatial and temporal scales. We tested 1) whether time-varying patterns were governed by factors reported as having the largest effects on fitness, 2) whether the trade-off between forage and predation risks differed among spatial and temporal scales and 3) if spatial and temporal scales are positively associated. We analysed the variation in habitat selection within the landscape and within home ranges at monthly intervals, with respect to land-cover type and proxys of food and cover over seasonal and diurnal temporal scales. The fine-scale temporal variation follows a nycthemeral cycle linked to diurnal variation in human disturbance. The large-scale variation matches seasonal plant phenology, suggesting food resources being a greater limiting factor than lynx predation risk. The trade-off between selection for food and cover was similar on seasonal and diurnal scale. Habitat selection at the different scales may be the consequence of the temporal variation and predictability of the limiting factors as much as its association with fitness. The landscape of fear might have less importance at the studied scale of habitat selection than generally accepted because of the predator hunting strategy. Finally, seasonal variation in habitat selection was similar at the large and small spatial scales, which may arise because of the marked philopatry of roe deer. The difference is supposed to be greater for wider ranging herbivores.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  41     Total Times Cited:  41     Cited Reference Count:  115 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/ecog.02152     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),DEER CAPREOLUS-CAPREOLUS;EUROPEAN ROE DEER;YELLOWSTONE-NATIONAL-PARK;GPS TELEMETRY DATA;PREDATION RISK;EURASIAN LYNX;TRADE-OFFS;FUNCTIONAL-RESPONSES;RED DEER;ANTIPREDATOR BEHAVIOR;Health Resources;Food,,

We evaluated the influence of space use and movement patterns of maternal female grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) on cub (defined as first year of life) survival in eastern Interior Alaska, USA, during 2008-2012. We monitored 9 GPS radiocollared females that produced 28 cubs in 12 litters ((x) over bar litter size = 2.3, range = 2-3). The estimated annual cub survival rate was 0.39 (95% CI = 0.20-0.57). In all cases the entire litter survived or died prior to den entrance. All cubs in a litter died either concurrently or within 14 days in 5 of 7 litters lost. Sixty-nine percent of cub mortality occurred between 31 May and 16 June. We did not document cub mortality before 31 May. Females with surviving cubs remained within 1 km of the den for a longer period following emergence than those that lost cubs. Between den emergence and the onset of vegetation green-up, females with surviving cubs used fewer habitat patches and remained in individual habitat patches longer than females that lost their cubs later in the summer. Females with surviving cubs exhibited different activity patterns compared with females that lost their cubs, particularly by moving less between midnight and mid-morning during 15 May-16 June. Once vegetation green-up occurred, movement rates of all maternal females were similar except that females with surviving cubs continued to move less during the morning hours (0000-1200 hr). We did not find evidence that the body size of the mother was a factor explaining cub survival nor was there evidence that cub survival was directly influenced by human causes. The most successful behavioral strategies used by maternal females to maximize cub survival appeared to be a combination of limiting movements to a few habitat patches between den emergence and vegetation green-up and limiting activity between midnight and mid-morning. We suggest that the ability to find and exploit suitable habitat patches during this period of limited resources may have allowed females to alter movements temporally and spatially and provision themselves and their cubs more effectively. This strategy was likely effective for both minimizing exposure to infanticidal adult bears and allowing cubs to maximize energy efficiency.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  9     Total Times Cited:  9     Cited Reference Count:  61 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.2192/URSUS-D-14-00015.1     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Alaska;behavioral strategies;cub mortality;grizzly bear;home range;seasonal movements;survival;Ursus arctos;BROWN BEARS;URSUS-ARCTOS;RISK;POPULATION;PREDATION;HABITAT;BLACK;ABUNDANCE;SELECTION;DYNAMICS,,

The scrounger tactic may provide greater antipredator benefits than the producer tactic because ""scroungers"" hop with their heads up and tend to occupy central positions in a group, whereas ""producers"" hop with their heads down and tend to occupy edge positions. We tested whether increasing an individual's vulnerability to predation (using wing-loading manipulations) causes an increased preference for the scrounger tactic in zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata). Wing-loading manipulations were effective at increasing focal individuals' perception of vulnerability to predation; treatment individuals increased their total time allocated to vigilance, whereas control individuals did not. Treatment individuals also increased their use of the scrounger tactic (proportion of hops with head up) and scrounged a greater proportion of patches, whereas control individuals exhibited no changes. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that the scrounger tactic confers greater antipredator benefits than the producer tactic, although whether antipredator benefits are achieved through differences in head orientation, spatial position, or both, remains unclear.

Predators target prey vulnerabilities to maximize hunting success, while prey trade-off foraging against predation avoidance. Though studies have demonstrated how predation risk can alter how prey allocate daily foraging effort, little work has considered the implications of this temporal component of behavior from a predator's perspective, or assessed its influence on broad-scale predator-prey interactions. We develop a method to compare daily activity patterns of avian predators and prey using data from 2 large citizen science datasets collected on different continents. Our analyses reveal evidence for convergent daily hunting strategies across avian predators, with distinct differences according to prey type. By comparing predator data with correspondent data from songbirds, our study suggests that predators (Accipiters) specialized to hunt songbirds match the activity patterns of their prey species. These results indicate predators have evolved common temporal hunting strategies to exploit temporal patterns in prey behavior.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  8     Total Times Cited:  9     Cited Reference Count:  63 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1093/beheco/ary133     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),activity patterns;foraging behavior;hunting strategies;predator-prey interactions;BODY-MASS;FORAGING ROUTINES;FALCO-TINNUNCULUS;DIURNAL-VARIATION;SMALL BIRDS;RISK;ALLOCATION;RESPONSES;BEHAVIOR;STRATEGIES;Prednisolone,,

In aquatic habitats, chemosensation is an important mode of communication and has been shown for many taxa, including crayfish, to be used in detection of predator and/or conspecific alarm cues. Here, we report on an experiment to test the hypothesis that detection of alarm cues results in greater individual investment in contests over shelters. We tested this hypothesis through dyadic contests between sex- and size-matched, non-reproductive individuals of Faxonius virilis. We found that crayfish responded to exposure to alarm cues by spending more time inside a shelter. We also report that in contests between pairs in which one crayfish had been exposed to alarm cues and the other had not, exposed individuals were significantly more likely to win ownership of a single shelter. However, we did not detect any differences in the contest parameters we recorded between exposed and unexposed crayfish. These impacts on both individual and social behavior indicate that the presence of predators is likely to have large effects on the distribution and structure of crayfish populations.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  2     Total Times Cited:  2     Cited Reference Count:  41 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/eth.13011     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),agonistic behavior;Faxonius virilis;non-consumptive effects;predation risk;RED SWAMP CRAYFISH;ORCONECTES-RUSTICUS;PREDATION RISK;PROCAMBARUS-CLARKII;FISH;DOMINANCE;SIZE;SEX;AGGRESSION;RESPONSES;Cues,,

Participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while engaged in a computerized chase-and-capture game task that involved optimizing monetary rewards obtained from capturing virtual prey while simultaneously avoiding capture by virtual predators. The game was played under two alternating contexts-one involving exposure to unpredictable task-irrelevant threat from randomly occurring electrical shocks, and a nonthreat control condition. Activation in and functional connectivity between the amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) was tested across threat and nonthreat task contexts with generalized psychophysiological interaction (gPPI) analyses. PTSD patients reported higher anxiety than controls across contexts. Better task performance represented by successfully avoiding capture by predators under threat compared with nonthreat contexts was associated with stronger left amygdala-vmPFC functional connectivity in controls and greater vmPFC activation in PTSD patients. PTSD symptom severity was negatively correlated with vmPFC activation in trauma-exposed controls and with right amygdala-vmPFC functional connectivity across all participants in the threat relative to nonthreat contexts. The findings showed that veterans with PTSD have disrupted amygdala-vmPFC functional connectivity and greater localized vmPFC processing under threat modulation of goal-directed behavior, specifically related to successfully avoiding loss of monetary rewards. In contrast, trauma survivors without PTSD relied on stronger threat-modulated left amygdala-vmPFC functional connectivity during goal-directed behavior, which may represent a resilience-related functional adaptation.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  3     Total Times Cited:  3     Cited Reference Count:  51 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1038/s41398-020-0739-4     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),"FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY;FEAR;UNCERTAINTY;EXPOSURE;TRAUMA;METAANALYSIS;ENHANCEMENT;INTOLERANCE;ABUSE;WOMEN;Prefrontal Cortex;Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic;Amygdala;Anxiety",,

Yet mating decisions can be fickle and inconsistent. Here, we explored predation risk as a source of variation in the effort a female is willing to invest in acquiring a preferred mate type (""choosiness""). We did so by comparing phonotaxis behaviors of female eastern gray treefrogs (Hyla versicolor) across trials with and without simulated predators. We tested the behavioral adjustment hypothesis (mate choice is unchanged under predation threat, but mate searching behaviors are modified to reduce conspicuousness) against the mate choice flexibility hypothesis (mate choice becomes indiscriminate under predation threat). Additionally, effectiveness of evasive behaviors may depend on predator attack strategy, so we incorporated two simulated predator cues (bird model vs predatory ranid call). We found support for the behavioral adjustment hypothesis: choosiness was maintained in the presence of predators, but females reduced conspicuousness of mate searching locomotion. Females approached the conspecific male stimuli slower and more cautiously in both predator treatments. In the ranid frog call treatment (stationary cue), females adjusted movements away from predator location. Females also attempted escape more frequently when predator cues were present. We suggest that focusing exclusively on the final mate decision may overlook nuances in mating decisions and hamper our understanding of the remarkable complexity of mate choice.        Significance statement        The presence of predators is an inherent threat to survival. This leads to the general expectation that higher predation risk results in more indiscriminate mate choice decisions and, hence, a weakening of sexual selection. Yet, discriminating mate choice may be maintained if prudent prey change their approach behavior when detecting the presence of a predator. We conducted playback trials with female treefrogs to test whether their willingness to invest in obtaining a more attractive mate (quantified by ""choosiness"") differed depending on the presence and type of predation risk. We found that females adjusted their approach behavior in a way that should make them less conspicuous to predators, but that they did not compromise their mate choice decisions. Our results show that strong sexual selection by females' choice can be maintained in high predation environments.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  68 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s00265-021-03124-y     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Sexual selection;Choosiness;Anuran amphibian;Mating decision variation;Behavioral adjustment;PREFERENCE FUNCTIONS;SEXUAL SELECTION;ESCAPE BEHAVIOR;RISK;FROGS;PLASTICITY;AVOIDANCE;BULLFROGS;RESPONSES;EXPOSURE;Prednisolone,,

We evaluated characteristics at sites where puma successfully killed elk in the Black Hills of South Dakota. We evaluated characteristics at coarse (79-ha plots) and fine (0.2-ha plot) scales across the landscape. Our primary objective was to obtain a better understanding of vegetation and terrain characteristics that may have facilitated greater susceptibility of elk to predation by puma. We evaluated effects of road density, terrain heterogeneity, probability of elk use, and vegetation variables at 62 puma kill sites of elk and 186 random sites to identify key landscape attributes where elk were killed by puma. Elk were killed by puma in high use areas. Elk were also killed in areas that had greater amounts of edge and intermediate ruggedness at the coarse scale. Further, elk were killed in areas with greater small tree density and woody debris at the fine scale. High germination rates of ponderosa pine trees are unique to the Black Hills and provide dense patches of cover for puma. We hypothesize that cover from small trees and woody debris provided conditions where puma could stalk elk in areas with optimal security cover for elk. We suggest managers implement vegetation management practices that reduce small tree density and woody debris in areas with greater density of meadow-forest edge if they are interested in potentially diminishing hiding cover for puma in elk high use areas.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  5     Total Times Cited:  5     Cited Reference Count:  68 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.2981/wlb.00248     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),PREDATION RISK;RESOURCE SELECTION;ANTIPREDATOR RESPONSE;TEMPORAL VARIATION;HABITAT SELECTION;FORAGING BEHAVIOR;HUNTING SUCCESS;PREY SELECTION;NATIONAL-PARK;LANDSCAPE;South Dakota;African Continental Ancestry Group,,

Optimization analyses in bird migration research have diversified greatly during the two recent decades with respect to methods used as well as to topics addressed. Methods range from simple analytical and geometric models to more complex modeling by stochastic dynamic programming, annual routine models and multiobjective optimization. Also, game theory and simulation by selection algorithms have been used. A wide range of aspects of bird migration have been analyzed including flight, fuel deposition, predation risk, stopover site use, transition to breeding, routes and detours, daily timing, fly-and-forage migration, wind selectivity and wind drift, phenotypic flexibility, arrival time and annual molt and migration schedules. Optimization analyses have proven to be particularly important for defining problems and specifying questions and predictions about the consequences of minimization of energy, time and predation risk in bird migration. Optimization analyses will probably also be important in the future, when predictions about bird migration strategies can be tested by much new data obtained by modern tracking techniques and when the importance of new trade-offs, associated with, e.g., digestive physiology, metabolism, immunocompetence and disease, need to be assessed in bird migration research.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  231     Total Times Cited:  240     Cited Reference Count:  149 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s10336-011-0694-1     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Flight;Stopover;Wind;Routes;Timing;KNOTS CALIDRIS-CANUTUS;OPTIMAL AVIAN MIGRATION;OPTIMAL FLIGHT SPEED;OPTIMAL FAT LOADS;RED KNOTS;STOPOVER DECISIONS;SPRING MIGRATION;FUEL STORES;WIND DRIFT;AUTUMN MIGRATION,,

In this paper, we explore the effects of interference upon group dynamics and individual behaviour, using a spatially explicit individual-based model. Each individual follows a simple behavioural rule based upon its energetic reserves and the actions of its neighbours (where the rule is derived from game theory models). We show that dominant individuals should have larger energetic reserves than their subordinates, and the size of this difference increases when either food is scarce, the intensity of interference suffered by the subordinates increases, or the distance over which dominant individuals affect subordinates increases. Unlike previous models, the results presented in this paper about differences in reserves are not based upon prior assumptions of the effects of social hierarchy and energetic reserves upon predation risk, and emerge through nothing more than a reduction in energetic intake by the subordinates when dominants are present. Furthermore, we show that increasing interference intensity, food availability or the distance over which dominants have an effect also causes the difference in movement between ranks to increase (where subordinates move more than dominants), and the distance over which dominants have an effect changes the size of the groups that the different ranks are found in.

The Red Desert region in south-central Wyoming, USA, has historically served as a stronghold for pronghorn populations, but many herds there have experienced declining population trends over the last two decades, concurrent with oil and natural gas development. These demographic changes and the potential for such energy development, its associated infrastructure, and other anthropogenic features including roads and fences to influence pronghorn habitat selection were the impetuses for our study. We sought to evaluate the potential effect of human-induced disturbance on multi-scale seasonal resource selection of 142 adult female pronghorn from 2013 to 2016 using 442 unique animal-season-year datasets. We utilized a traditional resource selection function to evaluate seasonal home-range selection and a step-selection function to assess fine-scale, patch-level seasonal selection. We also compared resource selection during daytime and nighttime hours with step-selection analyses. At the seasonal home-range scale, pronghorn selected for areas with more sagebrush during both seasons and areas farther from fences during summer. This trend was also apparent at the patch-scale level, where pronghorn selected sagebrush-dominant habitats and avoided crossing fences in all seasons during both day and night. Additionally at this scale, pronghorn selected areas farther from fences during daytime in summer. At the broader, home-range scale, pronghorn selected areas with greater road density during summer, but with lower road densities and farther from wells during winter. Avoidance of anthropogenic features during winter was also observed at the finer, patch-scale, with pronghorn selecting for increased density of roads and oil and natural gas wells during daytime in summer, but selecting areas farther from these features during daytime in winter. We recommend minimizing fencing and other forms of anthropogenic disturbance in high-quality seasonal pronghorn habitats with high proportions of sagebrush, particularly during winter when risk-avoidance responses may be amplified.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  7     Total Times Cited:  7     Cited Reference Count:  66 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1002/ecs2.2722     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Antilocapra americana;energy development;fence;oil and gas;pronghorn;resource selection function;roads;sagebrush;step-selection function;summer and winter resource selection;Wyoming;HABITAT SELECTION;MULE DEER;TEMPORAL VARIATION;ENERGY DEVELOPMENT;PREDATION RISK;BEHAVIOR;MORTALITY;DYNAMICS;ALLOCATION;PATTERNS,,

Camera trapping was used in order to assess climatic effects on weekly and daily watering patterns, investigate the influence of shrub cover on water-site selection, evaluate behavioural patterns displayed when using WT, and describe age and number of birds observed at WT. Red-legged partridges used WT throughout the study period, but significant use did not occur until August. decreasing dramatically in mid September, and ending in October. A circadian watering pattern was observed during daylight hours with most photographs taken from 08:00 hours to 11:00 hours (54.8%). Partridges displayed different behaviours (drinking, feeding/dusting, vigilance, moving/unknown), but patterns did not vary significantly throughout the day. WT were used mostly by adult birds with only 26.5% of photographs also depicting young partridges. WT selection was strongly influenced by the presence of surrounding vegetation as partridges preferred troughs with shrub cover.

In some lower termites, homosexual tandem running is observed in addition to ordinary heterosexual tandem running. An experiment designed to compare the risk of predation by a termite-hunting ant, Brachyponera chinensis Emery, showed that homosexual tandem running reduced the predation risk until termites encounter the opposite sex. Since an individual ant cannot capture two dealates at once, one of the two dealates forming a tandem can escape while the ant captures its partner. Therefore, the ""post-encounter risk"" of individuals running in tandem was lower than that of single individuals. The ""encounter risk"" with predatory ants was also examined using a mathematical model considering the increased detectability of the predator due to enhanced size of the prey unit. It was suggested that tandem running reduces the predation risk of both participants, even when the enhanced encounter risk was taken into account. In males, competition for the back position was often observed, and consequently, the male at the back was always larger than the male in front. When a male-male tandem encountered a female, the back male won the female more often than the front male. This result suggested that male-male tandem running should result in selection pressure in favor of vigorous males. In conclusion, tandem running decreases the individual predation risk through the dilution effect, and it also plays a role as a mechanism of indirect sexual selection.

We illustrate these points with a system that has coyotes (Canis latrans) as a predator and two species of congeneric deer (Odocoileus spp.) as prey. The deer employ different antipredator tactics (aggressive defense vs. flight) that result in contrasting patterns of age-dependent vulnerability in their probability of being captured when encountered by coyotes. We use long-term survival data and a simple mathematical model to show that (1) species differences in age-dependent vulnerability are reflected in seasonal predation rates and (2) seasonal variation in prey vulnerability and predator hunt activity, which can be associated with the availability of alternative prey, interact to shape seasonal and annual predation rates for each prey species. Shifting hunt activity from summer to winter, or vice versa, alleviated annual mortality on one species and focused it on the other. Our results indicate that seasonal variation in prey vulnerability and hunt activity interact to influence the impact that a predator has on any particular type of prey. Furthermore, these results indicate that seasonal variation in predation pressure is an important selection pressure shaping prey defenses.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  29     Total Times Cited:  29     Cited Reference Count:  64 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1086/591675     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),age-dependent vulnerability;alternative prey;antipredator behavior;predator-prey;seasonality;temporal variation;WHITE-TAILED DEER;RISK ALLOCATION HYPOTHESIS;MULE DEER;ANTIPREDATOR BEHAVIOR;FEEDING-BEHAVIOR;COYOTE PREDATION;SYMPATRIC MULE;NATIONAL-PARK;POPULATION;SIZE;Prednisolone,,

However, behavioural traits of an individual may not be free to evolve independently and can be correlated with one another. A positive link between aggressiveness and risk taking, for example, has been observed. We previously found second-generation hatchery grayling to be less aggressive than their wild conspecifics. In the present study, we examined both the level of aggression and the propensity to resume aggressiveness after a predator stimulus (risk taking) in young-of-the-year grayling from hatchery and wild strains of two populations. We were also interested in the effects of hatchery rearing on the link between the behaviours at the individual level and the consistency of this relation between populations. In contrast to our earlier findings, hatchery grayling appeared on average more aggressive than their wild conspecifics from the same population, whereas hatchery fish were more cautious after the threat stimulus in only one of the two populations. At the individual level, the behavioural association was, however, evident and similar in both strains of the two studied populations, such that the initially more aggressive fish also resumed aggressiveness faster after the threat than their less aggressive conspecifics. Consequently, while hatchery rearing for one generation has the potential to influence the expression of single behavioural traits, it may not necessarily result in changes in the link between them, that is, in the behavioural syndrome.

Ducklings are targeted by a range of terrestrial, aerial and aquatic predators, giving a strong selective advantage to individuals and broods that have effective ways to avoid predation. In experiments on naive mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) ducklings without an accompanying adult female we investigated the innate ability to identify and avoid threats at varying intensity from aerial, aquatic and terrestrial predators. Ducklings displayed increased vigilance in response to pre-recorded calls of predatory birds, representing a low level of threat. They did not react to visual and olfactory stimuli generated by motionless northern pike (Esox lucius). Neither did they show a strong response to caged American mink (Neovison vison) (visual and olfactory stimuli), although they avoided the area with the mink, indicating a certain level of recognition. High intensity threats were simulated by staging attacks from aerial (goshawk, Accipiter gentilis) and aquatic predators (northern pike). The aerial attack made ducklings dive and scatter under water, whereas the response to attack by pike was to run on the water and scatter in different directions. The lack of response to a 'passive' pike and the rather weak avoidance of mink indicate that olfactory cues are not as important in identifying a potential predatory threat by ducklings as are auditory cues. Visual cues appear to be of little importance unless they are combined with movement, and a clear response is only triggered when the intensity of predator threat is high. Mallard ducklings, thus, show an innate capacity to adjust anti-predator behaviour to different predator types and to threat intensity. Our study highlights the general trade-off between foraging needs and predator avoidance, but also second-order trade-offs in which innate avoidance behaviour towards one type of predator may increase predation risk from another.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  8     Total Times Cited:  8     Cited Reference Count:  33 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1163/1568539X-00003014     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),predator response;pike;mink;raptor;threat sensitive predator avoidance;innate behaviour;ANAS-PLATYRHYNCHOS;BUCEPHALA-CLANGULA;AMERICAN MINK;NORTHERN PIKE;AVOIDANCE;HABITAT;MORTALITY;SURVIVAL;MINNOWS;BROODS;Prednisolone,,

For understanding why the aggressive mimic's signals work, it is important to appreciate that these signals interface with the prey's perceptual system, and that the aggressive mimic can be envisaged as playing mind games with its prey. Examples of aggressive mimicry vary from instances in which specifying a model is straight forward to instances where a concise characterization of the model is difficult. However, the less straightforward examples of aggressive mimicry may be the more interesting examples in the context of animal cognition. In particular, there are spiders that prey on other spiders by entering their prey's web and making signals. Web invasion brings about especially intimate contact with their prey's perceptual system because the prey spider's web is an important component of the prey spider's sensory apparatus. For the web-invading spider, often there is also a large element of risk when practising aggressive mimicry because the intended prey is also a potential predator. This element of risk, combined with exceptionally intimate interfacing with prey perceptual systems, may have favoured the web-invading aggressive mimic's strategy becoming strikingly cognitive in character. Yet a high level of flexibility may be widespread among aggressive mimics in general and, on the whole, we propose that research on aggressive mimicry holds exceptional potential for advancing our understanding of animal cognition.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  26     Total Times Cited:  26     Cited Reference Count:  100 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/jzo.12036     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),communication;signals;information;sensory exploitation;perceptual systems;representation;categorization;ARANEOPHAGIC ASSASSIN BUG;PREDATOR-PREY INTERACTIONS;JUMPING SPIDERS ARANEAE;PORTIA-FIMBRIATA;CHEMICAL MIMICRY;BOLAS SPIDERS;SENSORY EXPLOITATION;SPITTING SPIDERS;SEXUAL SELECTION;ANIMAL COGNITION;Cognition;Aggression,,

Bednekon (1997, American Naturalist, 150, 373-392; 2001, Annales Zoologici Fennici, 38, 5-14) game-theoretic model assumes that group members trade the need to forage against the advantages of earlier risk detection when sentinelling. The model predicts that in the presence of another sentinel which may provide timely alerts, a sentinel will terminate its sentinel bout earlier when its energy level drops below a threshold that is higher than the depletion threshold that would incentivize it to resume foraging if it were sentinelling alone. We propose a complementary hypothesis, that this effect of shortened sentinel duration in the presence of another sentinel will be more pronounced for subordinate group members, for whom the fierce competition they suffer while foraging gets attenuated when a groupmate sentinels. We tested these hypotheses in Arabian babbler, Argya squamiceps, groups by comparing sentinel activity under natural conditions vis-a-vis sentinel activity in a feeding experiment in which one or two individuals were fed. In natural conditions, dominant males not only acted as sentinels longer and more often, but they also initiated a larger share of their sentinel bouts when another group member was already on guard. Following experimental feeding ad libitum, in line with the game-theoretic predictions (1) the probability of starting a sentinel bout was not affected by the presence of another sentinel, nor by its sex or rank, and (2) sentinel bouts that terminated in the presence of another sentinel were significantly shorter than sentinel bouts ending alone. Our findings suggest that the seemingly systematic exchange of sentinels may be a consequence of differential needs and incentives rather than active coordination.

These models can be applied to nearly any situation in which consumers compete-by any mechanism-for resources that are patchily distributed in their environment. Although IFD models have come to be broadly accepted, experiments that simultaneously test more than a single prediction are rare. Instead, investigators normally either test (1) for a relationship between the distribution of consumers and the distribution of resources or (2) whether average fitnesses are equal across resource patches. We conducted experiments with pea aphids (Acyrthosiphon pisum Harris) feeding on two patches of fava beans (Vicia faba L.) to fully independently parameterize an IFD model with interference competition and then test quantitative predictions about aphid spatial distributions and the payoffs of patch choice. We found a precise fit between aphids' predicted and observed reproductive successes. Furthermore, by varying patch ""quality"" in two ways, we were able to show that aphid distributions vary with the mode of resource variation in the predicted manner: aphids (1) matched resources when patches varied in size but not quality and (2) overmatched the good patch when patches varied in quality but not size (predicted as a consequence of weak interference). The close correspondence between quantitative predictions of the model with observed behaviors suggests that IFD theory is a framework with more explanatory power than is generally appreciated.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  14     Total Times Cited:  14     Cited Reference Count:  49 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s00265-006-0316-8     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),ideal free distribution;habitat selection;interference;game theory model;empirical test;UNEQUAL COMPETITORS;HABITAT SELECTION;POPULATION-DYNAMICS;CONTINUOUS INPUT;PREDATION-RISK;INTERFERENCE;CONSEQUENCES;APHID;BEHAVIOR;VARIES,,

Although vision can in principle provide instant information on a predator's position, direction of approach and identity, prey animals that face fast predators have to respond so early (close to the limits of detection) that visual cues are unreliable predictors of actual risk. This is a major problem for prey animals that have to balance predation risk with the cost of antipredator action. I investigated the visual cues fiddler crabs Uca vomeris use to decide when to run towards their burrow in response to an approaching (dummy) predator by running towards their burrow. The crabs did not always escape immediately when they first detected the dummy, but continued to monitor and assess its approach. The crabs relied on retinal image speed to trigger a home run. Retinal speed did not correlate well with the actual risk of predation because it confounded a predator's direction of approach with its speed and proximity. In an attempt to reconcile what is known about predator avoidance in semiterrestrial crabs, I propose a two-tier antipredator response system and discuss the crabs' multistage response strategy in the context of the associated costs and the availability of information. Multistage predator avoidance, which is common among prey animals, appears to be designed to improve the quality of information in an attempt to minimize the costs associated with predator avoidance responses.

Detailed observations of activity in the field and using 24 h infrared video in the laboratory revealed that the two predators had very different activity patterns. C. cyanostigma was active over the whole 24 h period, with a peak in feeding strikes at dusk and increased activity at both dawn and dusk, while P. fuscus was not active at night and had its highest strike rates at midday. The activity and foraging pattern of P. moluccensis directly opposes that of C. cyanostigma with individuals reducing strike rate and intraspecific aggression at both dawn and dusk, and reducing distance from shelter and boldness at dusk only. Juveniles examined were just outside the size-selection window of P. fuscus. We suggest that the relatively predictable diel behaviour of coral reef predators results from physiological factors such as visual sensory abilities, circadian rhythmicity, variation in hunting profitability, and predation risk at different times of the day. Our study suggests that the diel periodicity of P. moluccensis behaviour may represent a response to increased predation risk at times when both the ability to efficiently capture food and visually detect predators is reduced.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  16     Total Times Cited:  16     Cited Reference Count:  86 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1371/journal.pone.0111723     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),ANTIPREDATOR RESPONSE;FEEDING-BEHAVIOR;ACTIVITY RHYTHMS;GAME-THEORY;FISH;RISK;DIEL;ABUNDANCE;COMPETITION;SERRANIDAE;Prednisolone,,

Actual fitness benefits of site familiarity, however, have rarely been demonstrated. We placed GPS collars on 57 female black-tailed deer in coastal California over 4 years to track seasonal movements, determine home ranges, and monitor survival and cause of mortality. We used seasonal home ranges and core areas as measures of site familiarity and modeled how mortality risk varied with use of familiar areas, forage availability, age class, and elevational overlap with simultaneously collared pumas using Cox proportional hazards models. The use of familiar areas was the best predictor of mortality risk, and deer that had a 40 % probability of leaving their home range in a given week were four times more likely to die. Puma predation was the largest cause of mortality, and deer whose average weekly elevation was farther from the average elevation of pumas were less likely to die. While forage availability was not related to mortality risk, deer with lower forage availability were more likely to leave their home range during both summer and winter. Our results provide a rare example of fitness benefits associated with site familiarity and the use of familiar areas as a refuge from predation. The benefits of site familiarity are likely widespread in ungulates, especially when there are stable home ranges, complex habitats, and few cues of predation risk.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  41     Total Times Cited:  41     Cited Reference Count:  64 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s00265-014-1871-z     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Forage availability;Home range;Odocoileus hemionus columbianus;Predation;Puma concolor;Private information;PUMAS PUMA-CONCOLOR;PREY SHELL GAMES;TEMPORAL VARIATION;HABITAT SELECTION;RANGE FIDELITY;PREDATION;BEHAVIOR;SCALE;SURVIVAL;RISK;African Continental Ancestry Group,,

Less well recognized, however, is how increased aggregation may affect wildlife physiology. Crowding has been shown to induce stress responses, and increased glucocorticoid (GC) concentrations can reduce immune function and increase disease susceptibility. We investigated the effects of supplemental feeding and the aggregation that it induces on behavior and fecal glucocorticoid metabolite concentrations (fGCM) in elk (Cervus elaphus) using observational and experimental approaches. We first compared fGCM levels of elk on supplemental feedgrounds to neighboring elk populations wintering in native habitats using data from 2003 to 2008. We then experimentally manipulated the distribution of supplemental food on feedgrounds to investigate whether more widely distributed food would result in lower rates of aggression and stress hormone levels. Contrary to some expectations that fed elk may be less stressed than unfed elk during the winter, we found that elk on feedgrounds had fecal GC levels at least 31% higher than non-feedground populations. Within feedgrounds, fGCM levels were strongly correlated with local measures of elk density (r2?=?0.81). Dispersing feed more broadly, however, did not have a detectable effect on fGCM levels or aggression rates. Our results suggest that increases in aggregation associated with winter feedgrounds affects elk physiology, and the resulting increases in fGCM levels are not likely to be mitigated by management efforts that distribute the feed more widely. Additional research is needed to assess whether these increases in fGCMs directly alter parasite transmission and disease dynamics.

Prey exploited by predators engaged in a PS game could gain by evolving predator evasion tactics that shift the PS equilibrium of their predators towards a larger number of nonsearching scroungers. Prey can achieve this by imposing foraging costs that are specific to predators engaged in the producer strategy. Ye tested whether prey crypsis, a trait that has evolved as a demonstrably efficient strategy against solitary predators, imposed a producer-specific cost to group foragers that shifts PS equilibria towards more scrounging. We exposed four flocks of six nutmeg mannikins, Lonchura punctulata, small granivorous passerines that have been documented to play PS foraging games, to clumps of white millet seeds placed against one of two backgrounds that made them either cryptic or conspicuous. In three of four flocks, foraging under crytic conditions required more time to find food, resulted in more detection errors, had no effect on vigilance but significantly increased the frequency of scroungers at equilibrium. Having socially foraging predators may provide prey with an extra incentive to evolve producer-specific costs such as cryptic coloration.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  12     Total Times Cited:  12     Cited Reference Count:  36 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.anbehav.2005.10.008     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),TURDUS-MERULA L;LONCHURA-PUNCTULATA;ANTIPREDATORY VIGILANCE;NUTMEG MANNIKINS;CAPTIVE FLOCKS;HOUSE SPARROWS;SCROUNGER USE;IMAGE;PRODUCER;RISK;Food,,

We assessed the effects of raptor densities, anthropogenic features, landscape features, and Sage-Grouse hen behavior on Sage-Grouse hen survival. Survival of Sage-Grouse hens was positively associated with the proportion of big sagebrush (genus Artemisia L.) habitat within 0.27 km radius and road density and negatively associated with power-line density, proximity to forested habitat, and topographic ruggedness index within 0.27 km radius (TRI0.27). Raptor densities did not have individual effects on Sage-Grouse survival; however, an interaction between site-specific exposure to Golden Eagle (Aquila chrysaetos (L., 1758)) density (GOEA) and TRI0.27 indicated that negative effects of GOEA and TRI0.27 were dampened in areas with both high TRI0.27 and high GOEA. Survival of nonreproductive hens was greater than brooding or nesting hens. Hens that stayed in intermediate-size flocks and yearling hens had higher survival than hens in small or large flocks and hens >2 years old.

To date, the prevalence and magnitude of such compensatory foraging responses are poorly known. We examined energy balance compensation in free-ranging snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus Erxleben, 1777) via a food supplementation experiment to determine whether individuals reduced their daily energy expenditure (DEE) and activity periods in response to increased food availability. Overall, food supplementation had no effect on diel activity patterns, although males had higher DEE compared with females. During early and mid-winter, hares did not alter their activity periods in response to food supplementation, but during late winter, when natural food availability declined, food-supplemented females (but not males) were similar to 11% less active compared with controls. Natural food likely was sufficient and could have been acquired at relatively low energetic cost, but because males likely have higher DEE due to mating behavior whereas females may limit their activity (and thus DEE) to reduce predation risk, we conclude that gender-specific life-history demands can over-ride predicted responses to supplemental food when baseline food abundance is adequate.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  3     Total Times Cited:  3     Cited Reference Count:  59 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1139/cjz-2015-0074     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),snowshoe hares;Lepus americanus;food supplementation;activity period;daily energy expenditure;field metabolic rate;FOOD AVAILABILITY;ENERGY-EXPENDITURE;PREDATION RISK;SMALL MAMMALS;POPULATION;ACCLIMATIZATION;SQUIRRELS;SELECTION;PATTERNS;HISTORY,,

Most commonly these are large predators such as lions, African wild dogs and cheetahs, and elephants. Overpopulation of large predators leads to depletion of prey species, breakouts into neighbouring communities and increased risks for disease transmission. An overabundance of elephants leads to habitat destruction which is to the detriment of not only other herbivores but also certain bird species. By far, the most acceptable and effective method of population control is contraception. Another problem, particularly in South Africa, is the large numbers of large predators that are held in zoos, wildlife sanctuaries or captive breeding facilities. Once again, there is a need for contraception to control the rate of reproduction. In this review, we discuss the methods that have been most commonly used for some wildlife species in southern Africa. The methods include hormonal control and immunocontraception. We also address the problem of androgen-related aggressive behaviours in elephant bulls and giraffe males and present solutions that have been used to ameliorate such behaviours.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  9     Total Times Cited:  9     Cited Reference Count:  34 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/rda.12783     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),GNRH ANALOG DESLORELIN;IMMUNOCONTRACEPTION;CONTRACEPTION;ELEPHANTS;HYPOTHALAMUS;REPRODUCTION;VACCINATION;CARNIVORES;RESPONSES;BEHAVIOR;Self-Fertilization;Fertilizers;Fertility,,

However, many prey and predators exhibit a broad suite of behaviours. Here, we experimentally tested the effect of density-dependent prey and predator behaviours on per capita relative mortality rates using Florida bass (Micropterus floridanus) consuming juvenile Bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus). Experimental ponds were stocked with a factorial design of low, medium, and high prey and predator densities. Prey mortality, prey-predator behaviours, and predator stomach contents were recorded over or after 7 days. We assumed the mortality dynamics followed foraging arena theory. This pathologically flexible predator-prey model separates prey into invulnerable and vulnerable pools where predators can consume prey in the latter. As this approach can represent classic Lotka-Volterra and ratio-dependent dynamics, we fit a foraging arena predator-prey model to the number of surviving prey. We found that prey exhibited density-dependent prey behaviours, hiding at low densities, shoaling at medium densities, and using a provided refuge at high densities. Predators exhibited ratio-dependent behaviours, using an ambush foraging mode when one predator was present, hiding in the shadows at low prey-high predator densities, and shoaling at medium and high prey-high predator densities. The foraging arena model predicted the mortality rates well until the high prey-high predator treatment where group vigilance prey behaviours occurred and predators probably interfered with one another resulting in the model predicting higher mortality than observed. This is concerning given the ubiquity of predator-prey models in ecology and natural resource management. Furthermore, as Allee effects engender instability in population regulation, it could lead to inaccurate predictions of conservation status, population rebuilding or harvest rates.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  1     Total Times Cited:  1     Cited Reference Count:  87 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/fwb.13577     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Bayesian;behavioural plasticity;foraging arena;functional response;mesocosm;FUNCTIONAL-RESPONSE;ANTIPREDATOR BEHAVIOR;RISK;FISH;GAME;GROWTH;CONSEQUENCES;STABILITY;CAPABILITIES;AGGREGATION;Prednisolone,,

In Namibia, over 90% of cheetahs are found outside of protected areas, therefore risk of conflict with farmers is high. Since 1994, the Cheetah Conservation Fund has implemented a programme to prevent livestock depredation using livestock guarding dogs (LGDs). Long-term (25-year period) monitoring efforts in Namibia have provided insights on the efficiency and performance of LGDs and farmers` perceptions. LGDs reduced livestock losses for 91% of respondents and farmers were highly satisfied with their LGD. Poor performance from behavioural issues, such as ""staying at home"" and ""chasing game"", was linked to the LGDs receiving less care and being found in poorer body condition. Unwanted ecological impacts of wildlife killings by LGDs merit further investigation, but occurrence of behavioural issues reduced over time, suggesting a targeted and adaptive management approach to increase performance. Addressing behavioural issues, increasing LGD lifespans and understanding LGD performance under different conditions will be crucial for optimising LGD management leading to better performance.

However, due to frequent turbidity and water-level fluctuations, managers in the southern United States are often left to introduce emergent macrophytes instead of submersed macrophytes. Emergent macrophytes have less underwater structural complexity than most submersed macrophytes and therefore may not be as effective in reducing the predation risk of Largemouth Bass. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine if American water willow Justicia americana, a common emergent macrophyte species introduced in reservoirs, increases the survival of juvenile Largemouth Bass when exposed to predation. Predator-prey interactions between 10 juvenile and 1 adult Largemouth Bass were observed in tanks with natural densities of American water willow and compared with similar trials in vegetation-free control tanks. Each adult Largemouth Bass was tested once in each treatment (vegetation present or absent). Water willow significantly reduced the capture-to-attack ratio of adult Largemouth Bass and decreased the amount of time spent searching and the number of captures, resulting in significantly higher juvenile survival in the vegetated trials. Although water willow provided a similar increase in survival compared with previous studies using submersed macrophytes, the mechanism underlying this change differed, likely resulting from the more rigid stem design of water willow. We conclude water willow is an excellent candidate for establishment in reservoirs because it is easier to establish than many other macrophyte species yet still reduces predation risk on juvenile Largemouth Bass.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  6     Total Times Cited:  6     Cited Reference Count:  46 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1080/00028487.2015.1052559     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),FORAGING EFFICIENCY;JUSTICIA-AMERICANA;AQUATIC VEGETATION;PREY AVAILABILITY;BLUEGILL SUNFISH;PREDATION RISK;FISH PREDATORS;PLANT-DENSITY;HABITAT USE;GROWTH;Salix,,

Only few studies have considered that the risk of nest predation may also affect home-range size because nests become more difficult to defend as animals move further away. We used a theoretical model to explore the combined effects of nest defensibility, nest predation risk, and food availability on foraging distance from the nest, and hence home-range size. In our model, foragers adjust the foraging distance around the central place such that the required amount of food is collected within the available time with the lowest predation risk for the nest. We found that foraging distance decreased with food availability and the risk of nest predation during absence, but also with nest defensibility. When food was abundant, both nest predation risk and defensibility hardly influenced foraging distance. When food was scarce, animals able to deter predators foraged close-by, whereas animals less able to deter predators foraged further away. Likewise, animals that were themselves vulnerable to predation stayed closer to their nest if the nest provided safety, as is typical for central place foragers. This study is the first to assess the importance of nest defense and nest predation risk for foraging distance of central place foragers and provides a better understanding of the drivers of home-range size.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  4     Total Times Cited:  4     Cited Reference Count:  39 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1093/beheco/ary077     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Central place foraging;nest predation;theoretical model;movement behavior;defensibility;OYSTERCATCHERS HAEMATOPUS-OSTRALEGUS;PREDATION-RISK;PATCH USE;TERRITORY QUALITY;HABITAT SELECTION;TRADE-OFF;BODY-SIZE;BEHAVIOR;BIRDS;MODEL,,

Focal sampling was also performed to estimate activity budgets and to analyse vigilance sequences according to group size and pre/post-harvest factors. Night-time ranges were 40% larger than day-time ranges; the total home range size was 190 +/- 53 ha. Both night-time and day-time range sizes were independent of the pre/post harvest factor, although pre-harvest range centres shifted after harvest and the overlap areas were avoided. Habitat use within ranges was independent of the day/night and pre/post harvest factors, and hares made a larger use of cultivated areas than expected by chance (P < 0.01). Landscape diversity in the home range of hares was lower after harvest than before, but the animals did not maximise their access to crop diversity. Time spent scanning was negatively correlated with group size (r = -0.32, P < 0.005) and vigilance levels averaged lower after than before harvest (P < 0.05). Inter-scan intervals (ISIs) were non-randomly distributed and periodicity in the scanning behaviour was identified using spectral analysis. Hares foraging alone displayed a stronger cyclic pattern in vigilance sequences (i) than hares foraging communally (P = 0.043), and (ii) after than before harvest (P = 0.047). These results were analysed in connection with increased predation risks and shifts in resource distribution.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  47     Total Times Cited:  48     Cited Reference Count:  57 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.2981/wlb.1996.036     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Lepus europaeus;France;habitat use;activity budget;scanning behaviour;telemetry,,

However, they are very rarely included in models of population dynamics. Here, we investigate a recently discovered maternal effect, where maternal food availability affects the feeding rate of offspring so that well-fed mothers produce fast-feeding offspring. To understand how this maternal effect influences population dynamics, we explore novel predator-prey models where the consumption rate of predators is modified by changes in maternal prey availability. We address the 'paradox of enrichment', a theoretical prediction that nutrient enrichment destabilizes populations, leading to cycling behaviour and an increased risk of extinction, which has proved difficult to confirm in the wild. Our models show that enriched populations can be stabilized by maternal effects on feeding rate, thus presenting an intriguing potential explanation for the general absence of 'paradox of enrichment' behaviour in natural populations. This stabilizing influence should also reduce a population's risk of extinction and vulnerability to harvesting.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  2     Total Times Cited:  2     Cited Reference Count:  30 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1098/rspb.2015.2173     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),maternal effect;consumer resource;predator-prey;mathematical model;dynamics;consumption rate;FILTER SCREENS;POPULATION-DYNAMICS;DAPHNIA-GALEATA;ADAPTATION;ECOSYSTEMS;PLASTICITY;EXPOSURE;FAMINE;CYCLES;GROWTH;Prednisolone,,

Crabs were either exposed directly to a simulated predation threat (a moving cylinder) or the threat-induced response of a near neighbor. We found that fiddler crabs responded to the flight of their neighbors even when they, themselves, were not privy to the stimulus that induced their neighbor's response. However, the wider range of behaviors exhibited by these crabs-which included no reaction, freezing, running back to the burrow entrance, and burrow retreat-suggest that 'non-threatened' crabs either (1) perceived the gravity of the predation threat differently from their directly threatened neighbors and/or (2) engaged in behaviors that allowed them to acquire further information in the face of uncertainty. Conspecific behaviors also had an effect on the hiding duration of crabs, with individuals hiding longer if they saw both the predation threat and the flight of their neighbor. Our results suggest that cues provided by conspecifics can play an important role in guiding the antipredator response of refuge-seeking prey.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  27     Total Times Cited:  27     Cited Reference Count:  35 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s00265-005-0955-1     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),antipredator behavior;incomplete information;public information;refuge use;social context;vigilance;UCA-PUGILATOR;VISUAL CONTROL;WAITING GAME;SENSORY TRAP;BEHAVIOR;PREY;INFORMATION;COURTSHIP;ATTRACTIVENESS;DISTINGUISH;Prednisolone,,

These impacts may be amplified by habitat simplification and here we test whether sympathetic management of farmland hedgerows can reduce nest depredation, especially by corvids. We test whether songbirds select nest sites according to structural features of hedgerows (including nest visibility and accessibility), and whether these features influence nest predation risk. Songbirds selected nesting sites affording higher vegetation cover above the nest, increased visibility on the nest-side of the hedgerow and reduced visibility on the far side of the hedge. Nest survival was unrelated to corvid abundance and only weakly related (at the egg stage) to corvid nest proximity. Nest survival at the chick stage was higher where vegetation structure restricted access to corvid-sized predators (averaging 0.78 vs. 0.53), and at nests close to potential vantage points. Overall nest survival was sensitive to hedgerow structure (accessibility) particularly at low exposure to corvid predation, while the overall impact of corvid exposure was dependent on the relationship involving proximity to vantage points. Nest survival over the chick stage was much higher (0.67) in stock-proof, trimmed and mechanically cut hedgerows, (which tended to provide lower side visibility and accessibility) than in recently laid, remnant or leggy hedgerows (0.18). Long-term reductions in the management of British hedgerows may therefore be exposing nesting songbirds to increased predation risk. We recommend regular rotational cutting of hedgerows to maintain a dense woody structure and thereby reduce songbird nest predation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Heteromyid rodents of the Mojave, kangaroo rats and pocket mice, have fur-lined cheek pouches that allow them to carry larger loads of seeds under predation risk compared to gerbilline rodents of the Negev Deserts. Sidewinder rattlesnakes have heat-sensing pits, allowing them to hunt better on moonless nights when their Negev sidewinding counterpart, the Saharan horned vipers, are visually impaired.

The goal of this study was to describe and compare the visual fields of two ground-foraging passerines, House Finch Carpodacus mexicanus and House Sparrow Passer domesticus. We found that both species have a binocular field type that is associated with the accurate control of bill position when pecking. Both species have eye movements of relatively large amplitude, which can produce substantial variations in the configuration of the binocular fields. We propose that in these ground foragers, their relatively wide binocular fields could function to increase foraging efficiency by locating multiple rather than single food items prior to pecking events. The lateral fields of both species are wide enough to facilitate the detection of predators or conspecifics while head-down foraging. This suggests that foraging and scanning are not mutually exclusive activities in these species, as previously assumed. Furthermore, we found some slight, but significant, differences between species: House Sparrow binocular fields are both wider and vertically taller, and the blind area is wider than in House Finches. These differences may be related to variations in the degree of eye movements and position of the orbits in the skull.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  49     Total Times Cited:  51     Cited Reference Count:  40 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/j.1474-919X.2008.00860.x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),binocular vision;Carpodacus mexicanus;lateral vision;mutual exclusivity assumption;orbit orientation;Passer domesticus;predation risk;scanning;PASSER-DOMESTICUS;PREDATION RISK;ORBIT ORIENTATION;FOOD-INTAKE;BEHAVIOR;ESCAPE;FLOCKS;PERCEPTION;ECOLOGY;SIZE;Visual Fields;Prednisolone,,

In addition to starvation, animals are subject to death because of predation, bad weather, and so on. We focus on the case where the rate of mortality due to these sources is the same under all options. We investigate policies that maximise the expected lifetime reproductive success. It is found that the optimal value function is concave at low reserves (low-variance action region) and convex at high reserves (high-variance action region). The value function under the low-variance action has also the same shape and the same inflexion point. This result allows us to compute optimal policies just by looking at the low-variance value function. The result is also used to show that increasing the mortality rate increases the high-variance region under the optimal policy.

We show that aggressive interactions between the predatory shore crabs Carcinus maenas and Hemigrapsus sanguineus increased with predator density, yet did not increase as fast as negative interactions between conspecifics. At low density, interactions between conspecific and heterospecific predators had similar inhibitory impacts on predator function, whereas conspecific interference was greater than interference from heterospecifics at high predator density. Thus the impact of conspecific interference at high predator density was sufficient in itself that interactions with a second predator species had no additional impact on per capita predation.

Here, we use mathematical modeling to investigate the impact of disease transmission on the population dynamics benefits provided by group hunting. We consider a predator-prey model with foraging facilitation that can induce strong Allee effects in the predators. We extend this model by an infectious disease spreading horizontally and vertically in the predator population. The model is a system of three nonlinear differential equations. We analyze the equilibrium points and their stability as well as one-and two-parameter bifurcations. Our results show that weakly cooperating predators go unconditionally extinct for highly transmissible diseases. By contrast, if cooperation is strong enough, the social behavior mediates conditional predator persistence. The system is bistable, such that small predator populations are driven extinct by the disease or a lack of prey, and large predator populations survive because of their cooperation even though they would be doomed to extinction in the absence of group hunting. We identify a critical cooperation level that is needed to avoid the possibility of unconditional predator extinction. We also investigate how transmissibility and cooperation affect the stability of predator-prey dynamics. The introduction of parasites may be fatal for small populations of social predators that decline for other reasons.

Some animals can respond to these challenges by modifying their behaviour, particularly anti-predator behaviour, allowing them to persist in heavily transformed urban areas. We investigated whether the anti-predator behaviour of the Cape ground squirrel Xerus inauris differed in three localities that differed in their level of urbanisation. According to the habituation hypothesis, we predicted that ground squirrels in urban areas would: (a) be less vigilant and forage more; (b) trade-off flight/vigilance in favour of foraging; and (c) have shorter flight initiation distances (FID) when approached by a human observer. Observations were made in winter and summer at each locality. As expected, ground squirrels in urbanised areas were less vigilant and had shorter FIDs but did not trade-off between foraging and vigilance. In contrast, a population in a non-urbanised locality showed greater levels of vigilance, FID and traded-off vigilance and foraging. A population in a peri-urban locality showed mixed responses. Our results indicate that Cape ground squirrels reduce their anti-predator behaviour in urban areas and demonstrate a flexible behavioural response to urbanisation.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  16     Total Times Cited:  16     Cited Reference Count:  40 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s00114-012-0971-8     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Anti-predator behaviour;Behavioural modifications;Behavioural plasticity;Cape ground squirrel;Urbanisation;Xerus inauris;PREDATION RISK;GROUP-SIZE;VIGILANCE;RESPONSES;BIODIVERSITY;SCIURIDAE;EVOLUTION;PATTERNS;RODENTIA;BIOLOGY,,

However, how prey adjust behaviour to minimize risk from multiple threats remains unclear. In Central-Western France, we investigated patterns of activity, space and habitat use, and causes of variations during the diel cycle of the grey partridge (captive-reared, released), a farmland bird facing multiple risks (nocturnal predation, diurnal hunting pressure). We also investigated influence of individual space use, relative to risk-related features on the fate of birds. Birds adjusted their behaviours in ways consistent with the reduction of risk from nocturnal carnivores at night and hunters during daytime. We recorded bimodal crepuscular activity, likely explained by commuting movements between spatially-separated diurnal and nocturnal sites composed of different habitats: selection of open terrains and avoidance of predator reservoirs at night vs. use of high-vegetation cover during daytime. We observed space use differences between surviving, hunted and predated birds. Predation and hunting activities act as contrasting pressures, selecting birds based on their spatial behaviour, which has likely shaped diel adjustments at the population level. An improved consideration of temporal variation in environmental pressures would help to reliably address factors constraining populations, so increasing wildlife management efficiency.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  95 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1093/biolinnean/blab060     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),diel activity;global positioning system;grey partridge;habitat selection;space use;survival;PARTRIDGES PERDIX-PERDIX;GREY PARTRIDGES;HABITAT SELECTION;ANTIPREDATOR BEHAVIOR;ANIMAL TEMPERAMENT;SPACE USE;RISK;LANDSCAPE;SURVIVAL;CONSERVATION;Humanities;Humanism;Humans;Prednisolone,,

The New Zealand mud snail (Potamopyrgus antipodarum) exhibits avoidance behaviors when chemically detecting native piscine predators in New Zealand, and these behaviors appear specific to sympatric fish populations. Here we utilized three different introduced clonal populations of the New Zealand mud snail from North America, and various clones from New Zealand lakes, to examine the effect of a novel piscine predator, the blacknose dace (Rhinichthys atratulus), on behavior. Two of the introduced clones in North America are invasive (US1 and US2) while a third clone (US3) has not exhibited invasive tendencies. In a laboratory setting, we examined geotactic (vertical movement in response to gravity), photokinetic (differential speeds in response to light), and emergence behaviors of each clonal population in the presence and absence of a predator chemical cue. Geotaxis was measured by determining the vertical distance traveled in two minutes. Photokinesis was measured by quantifying the horizontal distance travelled in two minutes in light and dark conditions. Emergence time was determined by removing individuals from the water for five seconds and then replacing them in water and measuring the time to emerge from the shell. We found that the two invasive populations of the New Zealand mud snail (US1 and US2) detected and behaviorally responded to the novel predator utilizing positive photokinesis. The US1 population also showed some evidence of geotactically responding to fish odor. The introduced but likely non-invasive US3 population did not exhibit a detectable response to the odor of fish. Some evidence of photokinetic behavioral responses to the North American fish odor was also found in New Zealand native populations. Fish odor did not appear to influence the time it took for any population of snails to emerge from their shells. These results suggest that the ability to detect and respond to novel predators may be an important trait in the invasion success of New Zealand mud snails by potentially allowing snails to avoid novel predators.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  9     Total Times Cited:  9     Cited Reference Count:  48 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.3391/ai.2017.12.4.07     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),predator avoidance;chemical detection;behavior;geotaxis;photokinesis;native predator;invasive prey;FRESH-WATER SNAIL;ASEXUAL LINEAGES;LAKE-ONTARIO;AVOIDANCE-BEHAVIOR;FORAGING BEHAVIOR;NATURAL ENEMIES;GREAT-LAKES;RESPONSES;RISK;CUES;Prednisolone;New Zealand,,

Incubating parent birds are adapted to keep their eggs within a temperature range appropriate for embryo development, but king rail clutches are at risk of exceeding lethal temperatures in the latter half of the nesting season. We investigated whether behavioral plasticity during incubation enables parents to maintain clutch temperature within tolerable limits for embryo development. Video revealed that king rail parents interrupted incubation to stand above and shade their eggs. We tested the hypothesis that the onset of shading was a direct response to ambient temperature (adaptive plasticity). We monitored clutch temperature directly by experimentally adding into clutches a model egg embedded with a programmable iButton. We measured ambient temperature at the nest site simultaneously. Parents spent proportionately more time shading and less time incubating their eggs at higher ambient temperatures. Shading may primarily function in cooling the parent. The frequency and duration of shading bouts were significantly greater at higher ambient temperatures. Parents also took more frequent but shorter recesses in hotter conditions. Diurnal recesses exposed eggs to direct sunlight, and the highest clutch temperatures were recorded under these conditions. Complete hatching failure in at least one nest was attributable to high clutch temperature for an extended period. Because mean ambient temperature increases throughout the breeding season, we investigated seasonal patterns in onset of incubation and its effect on hatching rate. Later in the season, parents tended to initiate incubation earlier, and hatching asynchrony increased significantly. Together these results suggest that breeding king rails may be constrained in their ability to cope with sustained high temperatures should seasonal averages continue to rise as predicted.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  25     Total Times Cited:  25     Cited Reference Count:  54 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/jav.01056     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),EGG-VIABILITY;AVIAN INCUBATION;HATCHING ASYNCHRONY;REPRODUCTIVE PHASES;NEST PREDATION;BODY CONDITION;CLUTCH SIZE;EARLY-ONSET;EVOLUTIONARY;EMBRYOS,,

Populations that migrate can attain higher abundances because such movements allow access to higher quality resources, or reduction in predation risk resulting in increased fitness. However, most migratory species occur in partially migratory populations, a mix of migratory and non-migratory individuals. It is thought that the portion of migrants in a partial migration population is maintained either through (1) a population-level evolutionary stable state where counteracting density-dependent vital rates act on migrants and residents to balance fitness or (2) conditional migration, where the propensity to migrate is influenced by the individual's state. However, in many respects, migration is also a form of habitat selection and the proportion of migrants and residents may be the result of density-dependent habitat selection. Here, we test whether the theory of Ideal Free Distribution (IFD) can explain the coexistence of different migratory tactics in a partially migratory population. IFD predicts individuals exhibit density-dependent vital rates and select different migratory tactics to maximize individual fitness resulting in equal fitness (lambda) between tactics. We tested the predictions of IFD in a partially migratory elk population that declined by 70% with 19 years of demographic data and migratory tactic switching rates from >300 individuals. We found evidence of density dependence for resident pregnancy and adult female survival providing a fitness incentive to switch tactics. Despite differences in vital rates between migratory tactics, mean lambda (fitness) was equal. However, as predicted by the IFD, individuals switched tactics toward those of higher fitness. Our analysis reveals that partial migration may be driven by tactic selection that follows the ideal free distribution. These findings reinforce that migration across taxa may be a polymorphic behavior in large herbivores where migratory tactic selection is determined by differential costs and benefits, mediated by density dependence.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  78 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1002/ecy.3652     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),behavioral polymorphism;Cervus canadensis;ideal free distribution;migratory switching;partial migration;CONSPECIFIC REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS;ELK CALF SURVIVAL;PREDATION RISK;HABITAT SELECTION;DENSITY-DEPENDENCE;ROE DEER;DYNAMICS;PATTERNS;CONSEQUENCES;STRATEGIES,,

The optimal flight initiation distance occurs where expected postencounter fitness is maximized, which depends on the prey's initial fitness, benefits obtainable by not fleeing, energetic escape costs, and expected fitness loss due to predation risk. In current optimal escape theory, prey die when contacted by a predator. We explore effects of variable lethality, L, the probability of being killed on contact. Optimal flight initiation distance increases as lethality increases, matching expectations that prey should not flee when contact entails no fitness loss but should be increasingly wary as expected fitness loss on contact increases. Addition of lethality improves the ability of optimal escape theory to predict effects of factors affecting escape ability. Autotomy, the voluntary shedding of tails or other expendable parts as a last-ditch defense to permit escape, provides an example. After autotomy, running speed decreases in many prey, lethality increases because autotomy cannot be used again until the lost part has regenerated, and ability to obtain benefits may decrease due to reduced social status and foraging ability. These changes favor longer flight initiation distance but lowered initial fitness after autotomy has the opposite effect. Optimal escape theory including a lethality term clarifies how autotomy may lead to increase or decrease in flight initiation distance depending on the balance of its multiple effects. Effects of additional factors that may alter multiple parameters of the model, including age, sex, reproductive condition, injury, disease, and parasitism are discussed.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  68     Total Times Cited:  71     Cited Reference Count:  62 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1093/beheco/arp151     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),approach distance;autotomy;escape;flight distance;flight initiation distance;flush distance;predator lethality;FLIGHT-INITIATION DISTANCE;TAIL LOSS;RUNNING SPEED;ANTIPREDATOR BEHAVIOR;EUMECES-LATICEPS;RISK-ASSESSMENT;LEG AUTOTOMY;SOCIAL COST;LIZARD;SKINK;Prednisolone,,

In the field cricket Gryllus integer, males are aggressive with one another and fight vigorously over females and territories. We examined whether aggressiveness with other males was correlated with activity in a potentially dangerous context (a novel environment) in laboratory-raised virgin males. Aggressiveness was measured as fighting ability against a weight-matched opponent. First, we measured each cricket's latency to become active in a novel environment and latency to emerge from a refuge within a novel environment. Next, we determined which of two weight-matched males was more aggressive, by pitting the males together in an agonistic contest and counting the number of fights won by each male. More aggressive males, who won more fights, had shorter latencies to become active when placed in a novel environment and shorter latencies to emerge from a safe refuge. These results suggest that a behavioural syndrome exists in G. integer, in which more aggressive males are also more active in general, and possibly less cautious towards predation risk.

Many invasive mammalian predators are dietary generalists that hunt a variety of prey. These predators often rely upon olfaction when foraging, particularly at night. Little is understood about how prey odor cues are used to inform foraging decisions. Prey cues can vary spatially and temporally in their association with prey and can either reveal the location of prey or lead to unsuccessful foraging. Here we examine how two wild-caught invasive mammalian bird predator species (European hedgehogsErinaceus europaeusand ferretsMustela putorius furo) respond to unrewarded bird odors over successive exposures, first demonstrating that the odors are perceptually different using house mice (Mus musculus) as a biological olfactometer. We aim to test if introduced predators categorize odor cues of similar prey together, a tactic that could increase foraging efficiency. We exposed house mice to the odors using a standard habituation/dishabituation test in a laboratory setting, and wild-caught European hedgehogs and ferrets in an outdoor enclosure using a similar procedure. Mice discriminated among all bird odors presented, showing more interest in chicken odor than quail or gull odor. Both predator species showed a decline in interest toward unrewarded prey odor (i.e., habituation), but only ferrets generalized their response from one unrewarded bird odor to another bird odor. Hedgehog responses to unrewarded bird odors were highly variable between individuals. Taken together, our results reveal interspecific and intraspecific differences in response to prey odors, which we argue are a consequence of different diet breadth, life and evolutionary histories, and the conditions in each experiment.

Here we studied the effects of TFM on the olfactory capabilities and behavior of young-of-the-year (YOY) lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens). At ecologically relevant concentrations of TFM there was reduced olfactory response to all three cues (L-alanine, taurocholic acid, food cue) tested, suggesting that TFM inhibits both olfactory sensory neurons tested. Sturgeon exposed to TFM also showed a reduced attraction to the scent of food and reduced consumption of food relative to unexposed fish. Exposed fish were more active than control fish, but with slower acceleration. Fish were able to detect the scent of TFM, but failed to avoid it in behavioral trials. The connection between neurophysiological and behavioral changes, and the commonality of habitats between sturgeon and lamprey ammocoetes, suggests that there may be effects at the ecosystem level in streams that undergo lamprey control treatments.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  15     Total Times Cited:  15     Cited Reference Count:  60 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1021/acs.est.6b01051     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),LAMPREY PETROMYZON-MARINUS;FUNDULUS-HETEROCLITUS LARVAE;METAL-CONTAMINATED WATERS;SHORT-TERM EXPOSURE;WILD YELLOW PERCH;SEA LAMPREY;RAINBOW-TROUT;GREAT-LAKES;PREDATOR AVOIDANCE;STREAMS TRIBUTARY;Smell,,

These factors may apply even to highly cryptic species that sometimes must flee. Horned lizards (Phrynosoma) rely on crypsis because of coloration, flattened body form, and lateral fringe scales that reduce detectability. At close range they sometimes squirt blood-containing noxious substances and defend themselves with cranial spines. These antipredatory traits are highly derived, but little is known about the escape behavior of horned lizards. Of particular interest is whether their escape decisions bear the same relationships to predation risk and opportunity costs of escaping as in typical prey lacking such derived defenses. We investigated the effects of repeated attack and direction of predator turning on P. cornutum and of opportunity cost of fleeing during a social encounter in P. modestum. Flight initiation distance was greater for the second of two successive approaches and probability of fleeing decreased as distance between the turning predator and prey increased, but was greater when the predator turned toward than away from a lizard. Flight initiation distance was shorter during social encounters than when lizards were solitary. For all variables studied, risk assessment by horned lizards conforms to the predictions of escape theory and is similar to that in other prey despite their specialized defenses. Our findings show that these specialized, derived defenses coexist with a taxonomically widespread, plesiomorphic method of making escape decisions. They suggest that escape theory based on costs and benefits, as intended, applies very generally, even to highly cryptic prey that have specialized defense mechanisms.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  8     Total Times Cited:  10     Cited Reference Count:  57 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/j.1439-0310.2010.01805.x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),FLIGHT-INITIATION DISTANCE;DENDROBATES-AURATUS;RISK-ASSESSMENT;PREDATION RISK;BEHAVIOR;BLOOD;CONSPICUOUSNESS;VIGILANCE;RESPONSES;FROGS;Lizards,,

Determining whether prey signals are cryptic or aposematic is a prerequisite for understanding the ecological and evolutionary implications of predator-prey interactions. This study investigates whether coloration and pattern in an exceptionally polymorphic toad, Rhinella alata, from Barro Colorado Island, Panama reduces predation via background matching, disruptive coloration, and/or aposematic signaling. When clay model replicas of R. alata were placed on leaf litter, the model's dorsal pattern but not its colour - affected attack rates by birds. When models were placed on white paper, patterned and un-patterned replicas had similar attack rates by birds.

As temperate-zone species' expand their ranges north, different and potentially severe limiting factors may begin to affect their ability to survive and reproduce. The wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) is one example of a species undergoing rapid northern expansion.        Aims An improved understanding of wild turkey demography at the species' northern range periphery would facilitate effective management of this important game species. Therefore, we undertook a study to evaluate survival, causes of mortality, and behavioural strategies that may govern survival of female wild turkeys.        Methods We captured 53 female wild turkeys, and used backpack transmitters to monitor their individual fates during 2012-13.        Key results The annual survival estimate was 0.37 (95% CI: 0.25-0.55), with the lowest seasonal survival in the winter. The most frequent cause of mortality was mammalian predation, predominately by coyotes (Canis latrans). Age, proximity to supplemental food, and habitat use did not affect risk of mortality.        Conclusions Northern wild turkeys in our study exhibited lower survival and suffered higher predation than did populations in the species' historic range. Despite our findings, the wild turkey has expanded its range northwards and continues to exist in these peripheral areas. This may be due to high productivity or a source-sink dynamic, whereby high mortality is offset by immigration from the south.        Implications The low survival and high predation of wild turkeys in the north must be considered when developing management strategies, particularly if interest exists in translocating turkeys farther north. Further research is needed to better understand whether northern turkey populations persist as sinks.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  7     Total Times Cited:  7     Cited Reference Count:  42 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1071/WR14061     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),climate change;Meleagris gallopavo;range expansion;WINTER SURVIVAL;RISK-FACTORS;HENS;REPRODUCTION;REGRESSION;LANDSCAPE;RESPONSES;ECOLOGY;SCALE;Turkey;Turkeys,,

Recent empirical and theoretical studies suggest that nest predation is an important ecological factor affecting the occurrence and evolution of CBP; however, behavioural responses of parasites to nest predation remain unexplored. Here we report on a field experiment addressing the ability of parasitically laying common goldeneye, Bucephala clangula, females to respond to nest predation, based either on their own experience or on public information. Females that started parasitic laying in a nest and afterwards experienced partial clutch predation stopped laying in the nest. However, nests that faced partial clutch predation earlier in the season were not avoided by other parasitically laying females later in the season; these later-laying females had not themselves experienced the partial clutch predation in the nest. Hence, considering within-season responses to nest predation, a parasite uses its own experience, rather than public information, in laying decisions and nest choice. The rate of parasitic laying in the experimental nests decreased from the first to the last year of the experiment. Because the experimental nests never produced a successful clutch, this finding suggests that parasites used information on the ever-failing nature of the nests and avoided laying in them. Our results offer new experimental evidence to support the hypothesis that safety and success of nest sites play important roles in CBP. (C) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Our analysis of feeding and mortality of the minnows indicates that mortality is incurred so as to feed above maintenance requirements, that feeding rate is suppressed in response to the presence of predators, and that the balance of feeding against mortality can be estimated using a life-history parameter theta, interpreted theoretically as the marginal rate of substitution of mortality rate for growth rate.

Poor-quality food (mainly the bilberry Vaccinium myrtillus) for these herbivores is induced by seed masting failure in the previous year, when the bilberry is able to allocate resources for chemical defence (the mast depression hypothesis; MDH). The predation facilitation hypothesis (PFH) in turn states that increased searching activity of vole-eating predators during or after the decline year of voles disturbs incubating and brooding grouse females. The behaviours used by grouse to avoid these terrestrial predators make them more vulnerable to predation by goshawks. We tested the main predictions of the MDH and PFH by collecting long-term (21-year) data from black grouse Tetrao tetrix hens and cocks killed by breeding goshawks supplemented with indices of bilberry crop, vole abundance and small carnivores in the vicinity of Oulu, northern Finland. We did not find obvious support for the prediction of the MDH that there is a negative correlation of bilberry crop in year t with vole abundance and with predation index of black grouse hens in year t + 1. We did find obvious support for the prediction of the PFH that there is a positive correlation between predator abundance and predation index of grouse hens, because the stoat Mustela erminea abundance index was positively related to the predation index of black grouse hens. We suggest that changes in vulnerability of grouse hens may mainly be caused by the guild of vole-eating predators, who shift to alternative prey in the decline phase of the vole cycle, and thus chase grouse hens and chicks to the talons of goshawks and other avian predators.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  12     Total Times Cited:  13     Cited Reference Count:  51 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s00442-010-1884-x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Vole cycle;Grouse cycle;Plant cycle;Carnivores;Predation;The mast depression;CAPERCAILLIE TETRAO-UROGALLUS;POPULATION FLUCTUATIONS;VACCINIUM-MYRTILLUS;ACCIPITER-GENTILIS;LAGOPUS-LAGOPUS;SIDED VOLES;DIET;HABITAT;CYCLES;NUTRITION;African Continental Ancestry Group;Prednisolone,,

However, light may adversely affect native species; in particular, little is known about invertebrate responses to altered lighting regimes. We investigated how endemic orthopterans responded to artificial light at Maungatautari Ecological Island (Waikato, New Zealand). We predicted that based on their nocturnal behaviour, ecology and evolutionary history, tree weta (Hemideina thoracica) and cave weta (Rhaphidophoridae) would reduce their activity under illumination. Experimental stations (n = 15) experienced three evenings under each treatment (order randomised): (a) light (illuminated LED fixture), (b) dark (unilluminated LED fixture) and (c) baseline (no lighting fixture). Weta visitation rates were analysed from images captured on infra-red trail cameras set up at each station. Light significantly reduced the number of observations of cave (71.7% reduction) and tree weta (87.5% reduction). In observations where sex was distinguishable (53% of all visits), male tree weta were observed significantly more often (85% of visits) than females (15% of visits) and while males avoided illuminated sites, no detectable difference was observed across treatments for females. Sex could not be distinguished for cave weta. Our findings have implications for the use of light as a novel pest management strategy, and for the conservation of invertebrate diversity and abundance within natural and urban ecosystems worldwide that may be affected by light pollution.

In birds and aquatic mammals, ASEC is associated with unihemispheric sleep wherein the cerebral hemisphere contralateral to (i.e. neurologically connected to) the closed eye sleeps while the other cerebral hemisphere remains awake with its associated eye open and functional. Evidence from birds suggests that ASEC is an important anti-predator adaptation to mediate the trade-off between the need to remain vigilant and the need to sleep. However, the anti-predator correlates of ASEC remain largely unstudied in other animals. Here, we present behavioral evidence that ASEC in reptiles is also an anti-predator adaptation used in response to an increase in the risk of predation. ASEC was measured in captive western fence lizards (Sceloporus occidentalis) individually exposed to three experimental treatments: (1) an empty terrarium, (2) a terrarium housing a novel moving object, and (3) a terrarium housing a live predator (snake). Predator exposure elicited significantly higher levels of vigilance, mostly due to an increase in ASEC. This increase in ASEC came largely at the expense of synchronous eye closure (both eyes closed). Lizards in ASEC also showed a strong tendency to orient their open eye in the direction of the predator. We suggest that lizards engaged in ASEC are sleeping unihemispherically and are thus able to maintain a level of vigilance concurrent with sleep.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  45     Total Times Cited:  45     Cited Reference Count:  32 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/j.1439-0310.2006.01138.x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),UNIHEMISPHERIC SLEEP;CTENOSAURA-PECTINATA;CHELONIAN REPTILES;CAIMAN-SCLEROPS;WAKEFULNESS;VIGILANCE;PREDATION;RISK;PERSPECTIVES;DEPRIVATION;Lizards;Prednisolone,,

One hypothesis for the decline is the loss of suitable habitat, although little is known about the ecological requirements of this species. To elucidate seasonal home range and habitat selection by eastern spotted skunks, we conducted telemetry-based field work in the Ouachita Mountains of western Arkansas, USA. During 2 years of field work, we collected day- and nighttime radiolocations for 33 eastern spotted skunks. We used kernel-based utilization distributions, volume of intersection indices, and weighted compositional analysis to evaluate seasonal home range dynamics and habitat selection. Although we found moderate adult male site fidelity, there were large seasonal differences in home range size, with ranges of between 76 ha and 175 ha (+/- 22-62 SE) during summer, fall, and winter, and home ranges of 866 ha (+/- 235 SE) during spring. Male home range increases in the spring were likely caused by questing behavior in search of reproductive females. Females maintained home ranges of 54 ha to 135 ha (+/- 7-30 SE) and moderate site fidelity during all seasons. During each season, we observed selection of young shortleaf pine ( Pinus echinata) and hardwood stands over other available cover types, likely due to a preference for a dense, complex understory and a closed canopy overstory to reduce predation risk. Most habitats in the study region were managed for an herbaceous understory and an older, more open canopy, in part to benefit red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis) populations. Thus, if simultaneous management for these 2 vertebrates is a goal, a balance of early and late successional habitat should be reached.

In addition, wood frog (Rana sylvatica) tadpoles learned to respond to chemical cues from unfamiliar predators with danger based on embryonic conditioning. Therefore, if embryonic experience is a good predictor of future risk, learning associated with exposure to negative stimuli during development may be adaptive.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  93     Total Times Cited:  95     Cited Reference Count:  32 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1098/rspb.2008.0754     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),embryos;learning;predation;Ambystoma annulatum;Rana sylvatica;LARVAL RINGED SALAMANDERS;RISK;CORTICOSTERONE;EXPERIENCE;EXPOSURE;BEHAVIOR;DANGER;MEMORY;RATS;Prednisolone,,

In the Kalahari region of Botswana, herbivore populations historically depended on seasonal access to the nutrient-rich Schwelle area in the wet season and to water from the Boteti River during drought periods. Blue wildebeest Connochaetes taurinus in the Central Kalahari Game Reserve (CKGR) have lost access to these key habitats due to fences and encroachment of livestock and humans. We deployed satellite collars onto 10 female wildebeest in the CKGR to examine seasonal movements and habitat selection in relation to the environmental conditions and fragmented ecosystem. Wildebeest favoured open, short-grass pan habitats in all seasons, probably in response to better forage quality and lower predation risk. The ability to remain in pan habitats during the dry season was a result of artificial water provision. A wildebeest herd that had no artificial water in its home range survived the dry season, whereas those wildebeest that were accustomed to water provision died when their water points failed in the dry season. Thus, water provision altered adaptive behaviour and reduced resilience of the population to the arid environment.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  14     Total Times Cited:  14     Cited Reference Count:  71 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/aje.12439     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),artificial water provision;blue wildebeest;daily distance;forage quality;Kalahari;migration;ELK CERVUS-ELAPHUS;AFRICAN SAVANNA;COLLAR PERFORMANCE;PATTERNS;HERBIVORES;HETEROGENEITY;POPULATION;LANDSCAPE;MIGRATION;QUALITY,,

Resource allocation trade-offs partition the acquired resources between multiple traits, such as growth or morphological defense. We develop a mathematical model for prey organisms that comprise time and resource allocation trade-offs for multiple defense traits. Fitness is determined by growth and survival during ontogeny. We determine optimal defense strategies for environments that differ in their resource abundance, predation risk, and defense effectiveness. We compare the results with results of simplified models where single defense traits are optimized. Our results indicate that selection acts in favor of integrated traits. The selective advantage of expressing multiple defense traits is most pronounced at intermediate environmental conditions. Optimizing single traits generally leads to a more pronounced response of the defense traits, which implies that studying single traits leads to an overestimation of their response to predation. Behavioral defense and morphological defense compensate for and augment each other depending on predator densities and the effectiveness of the defense mechanisms. In the presence of time constraints, the model shows peak investment into morphological and behavioral defense at intermediate resource levels.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  60     Total Times Cited:  62     Cited Reference Count:  53 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1086/509939     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),complex traits;phenotypic plasticity;predator-prey;life-history evolution;INDUCED PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY;TRAIT COMPENSATION;LIFE-HISTORY;PREDATION MORTALITY;FOOD AVAILABILITY;GROWTH-RATE;RISK;SIZE;CONSTRAINTS;EVOLUTION;Resource Allocation,,

However, to date, studies have not fully elucidated how fine- and broad-scale habitat decisions by individual prey can help balance food versus risk. We studied broad-scale habitat selection by Newfoundland caribou Rangifer tarandus, focusing on trade-offs between predation risk versus access to forage during the calving and post-calving period. We improved traditional measures of habitat availability by incorporating fine-scale movement patterns of caribou into the availability kernel, thus enabling separation of broad and fine scales of selection. Remote sensing and field surveys served to create a spatio-temporal model of forage availability, whereas GPS telemetry locations from 66 black bears Ursus americanus and 59 coyotes Canis latrans provided models of predation risk. We then used GPS telemetry locations from 114 female caribou to assess food-predation trade-offs through the prism of our refined model of caribou habitat availability. We noted that migratory movements of caribou were oriented mainly towards habitats with abundant forage and lower risk of bear and (to a lesser extent) coyote encounter. These findings were generally consistent across caribou herds and would not have been evident had we used traditional methods instead of our refined model when estimating habitat availability. We interpret these findings in the context of stereotypical migratory behaviour observed in Newfoundland caribou, which occurs despite the extirpation of wolves Canis lupus nearly a century ago. We submit that caribou are able to balance food acquisition against predation risk using a complex set of factors involving both finer and broader scale selection. Accordingly, our study provides a strong argument for using refined habitat availability estimates when assessing food-predation trade-offs.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  38     Total Times Cited:  38     Cited Reference Count:  73 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/ecog.01305     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),PREY SHELL GAMES;HABITAT-SELECTION;RANGIFER-TARANDUS;PREDATION RISK;HOME-RANGE;FUNCTIONAL-RESPONSES;NEWFOUNDLAND CARIBOU;LIMITING FACTORS;DECISION-MAKING;SCALE,,

However, little is known about the behavioral responses to predation risk for individuals that experienced different environmental conditions for extended periods of time, such as food levels and light conditions. In this experimental study, we tested whether previous long-term exposure to different food levels (low versus high) and light conditions (0-h light versus 8-h light) plays a significant role in shaping the antipredator response (i.e., the probability of emerging from the refuge and the distance moved) to stimuli from caged larval dragonflies, in larvae of the fire salamander (Salamandra salamandra). Specifically, we quantified behavioral differences in the response to predation risk in larval salamanders that were reared in the laboratory for 2 months under controlled food and light conditions. The results of this study showed that the interaction between food level and light conditions affected the antipredator behavior of the larvae. Fire salamander larvae maintained at low food levels and in 8-h light conditions emerged from the refuge with a higher probability (i.e., took more risk) than larvae maintained at high food levels and all other combinations of light conditions. Thus, our results highlight the complexity of antipredator responses, pointing attention to the fact that interactions among environmental factors are likely to determine the magnitude of antipredator response.Significance statementFew studies have investigated the role of multiple environmental factors on the expression of predator-induced behavioral responses. Specifically, because no study has so far investigated the risk-taking behavior in individuals exposed to long-term, contrasting food levels, and light conditions, we investigated this in amphibian larvae. We showed that environmental conditions interactively determined antipredator behavior. This highlights the importance of considering long-term environmental conditions experienced by an organism and their interactions when experimentally studying behavioral variation to adequately understand its expression in natural conditions.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  64 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s00265-021-02966-w     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Behavioral response;Environmental cues;Food levels;Refuge emergence;Light condition;Salamander;Breeding;Food,,

The recent spread of the cane toad (Rhinella marina) has caused serious population declines for some predatory reptile and mammal species. To determine a priori whether or not cane toad poisoning endangers native species, we can test the fates of predators in laboratory trials. We investigated whether an Australian marsupial whose range is increasingly being occupied by cane toads (the yellow-footed antechinus, Antechinus flavipes) is at risk of toad poisoning by testing (1) whether yellow-footed antechinuses approach or attack cane toads and, if so, whether they die as a result; and (2) if they survive, whether they then learn to avoid toads in subsequent encounters. We also investigated the effects of sympatry with toads on the feeding response. In all, 58% of antechinuses from eastern New South Wales approached or attacked a toad (over 4 or 5 opportunities to do so, on successive nights), and none showed ill effects after doing so. Antechinuses that attacked (killed or ingested) toads rapidly learnt to avoid them. Antechinuses from toad-exposed populations ingested more toad flesh, but otherwise reacted in the same ways as did conspecifics from toad-free areas. Hence, the yellow-footed antechinus is unlikely to face population declines via toad poisoning.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  5     Total Times Cited:  5     Cited Reference Count:  37 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1071/AM12025     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),invasive species;predator learning;taste aversion;toxic prey;KAKADU NATIONAL-PARK;NEW-SOUTH-WALES;BUFO-MARINUS;PLANIGALE-MACULATA;EXTINCTION RISK;RAPIDLY LEARNS;DECLINE;MAMMALS;MARSUPIALS;IMPACT;Survival Rate;Prednisolone,,

Despite the importance of this lagomorph for both management and conservation, a quantitative summary of its spatiotemporal behaviour is still lacking. Taking advantage of 51 selected studies conducted throughout the native range of the hare and spanning the last 40 years, we used meta-analytic approaches in order to: 1) investigate home range size in relation to ecological factors; 2) test preference across major habitat types; and 3) provide a quantitative synthesis of hare activity patterns. Temporally adjusted home range size of hare populations decreased with increasing cropland cover (cereal and non-cereal crops), suggesting that home range size gets smaller with increasing food availability, and predicting that hare populations living in absence of crops would double their mean home range size compared to those inhabiting areas covered entirely by cropland. Hare populations where more males were sampled showed larger home ranges, in line with the polygynous mating system of this species. Hares preferred cropland and grassland over other habitats for foraging, thus selecting the two habitats characterised by the majority of trophic resources for this species. Yet, habitat types were used proportionally to their availability overall, except for the general avoidance of human settlements. Hares were mainly nocturnal, with the lowest activity during daytime, when activity was about one third of that at night, and showed moonlight avoidance, probably to limit encounters with nocturnal predators. Our work emphasises the importance of open habitats and especially cropland for this lagomorph, but also suggests some plasticity in the use of space and time by hares. Such plasticity may help this mammal to cope with future environmental changes, providing that landscape heterogeneity is maintained.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  130 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/mam.12290     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),activity rhythms;Eurasia;habitat selection;herbivores;home range;lagomorphs;Lepus europaeus;HOME-RANGE SIZE;FOX VULPES-VULPES;HABITAT SELECTION;PREDATION RISK;ACTIVITY PATTERNS;ORYCTOLAGUS-CUNICULUS;POPULATION-DENSITY;SPATIAL-BEHAVIOR;FOOD SELECTION;PALLAS;Fibrinogen,,

In particular, local distributions of these predators may affect ungulate behavior, use of space, and dynamics. Our goal was to develop generalizable predictions of habitat selection by wolves and mountain lions across western Montana. We hypothesized both predator species would select habitat that maximized their chances of encountering and killing ungulates and that minimized their chances of encountering humans. We assessed habitat selection by these predators during summer using within-home range (3(rd) order) resource selection functions (RSFs) in multiple study areas throughout western Montana, and tested how generalizable RSF predictions were by applying them to out-of-sample telemetry data from separate study areas. Selection for vegetation cover-types varied substantially among wolves in different study areas. Nonetheless, our predictions of 3(rd) order selection by wolves were highly generalizable across different study areas. Wolves consistently selected simple topography where ungulate prey may be more susceptible to their cursorial hunting mode. Topographic features may serve as better proxies of predation risk by wolves than vegetation cover-types. Predictions of mountain lion distribution were less generalizable. Use of rugged terrain by mountain lions varied across ecosystem-types, likely because mountain lions targeted the habitats of different prey species in each study area. Our findings suggest that features that facilitate the hunting mode of a predator (i.e. simple topography for cursorial predators and hiding cover for stalking predators) may be more generalizable predictors of their habitat selection than features associated with local prey densities.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  1     Total Times Cited:  1     Cited Reference Count:  103 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1371/journal.pone.0254827     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),PUMAS PUMA-CONCOLOR;WHITE-TAILED DEER;RESOURCE SELECTION;PREDATION RISK;TROPHIC CASCADES;DISTRIBUTION MODELS;WOODLAND CARIBOU;LINEAR FEATURES;WOLF PREDATION;PREY SELECTION;Mountaineering;Ecosystem,,

In particular, if estimates have been calculated in a Bayesian framework with a sensible prior, it is best to use unbiased estimates. We review the extent of evidence for and against viewing animals (including humans) as Bayesian decision-makers. We pay particular attention to the Ellsberg Paradox, a classic result from experimental economics, in which human subjects appear to deviate from optimal decision-making by demonstrating an apparent aversion to ambiguity in a choice between two options with equal expected rewards. The paradox initially seems to be an example where decision-making estimates are biased relative to the Bayesian optimum. We discuss the extent to which the Bayesian paradigm might be applied to the evolution of decision-makers and how the Ellsberg Paradox may, with a deeper understanding, be resolved.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  68     Total Times Cited:  68     Cited Reference Count:  89 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s10071-011-0387-4     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Ambiguity;Animal decisions;Cognitive bias;Ellsberg Paradox;Risk;Uncertainty;AMBIGUITY AVERSION;ANIMAL EMOTION;COGNITIVE BIAS;SAVAGE AXIOMS;RISK;INFORMATION;CHOICE;PREDATION;BEHAVIOR;RULES;Decision Making;Bias (Epidemiology),,

Survival of longnose dace did not differ in the presence of adult rainbow trout previously exposed to active prey and those not previously exposed to active prey (chi(2)(1)=0.28, P=0.60). In field enclosures, the number of longnose dace decreased at a faster rate in the presence of rainbow trout relative to controls within the first 72h, but did not differ between moderate and high densities of rainbow trout (F-2,F-258.9=3.73, P=0.03). Additionally, longnose dace were found in 7% of rainbow trout stomachs after 72h in enclosures. Rainbow trout acclimated to the stream for longer periods had a greater initial influence on the number of longnose dace remaining in enclosures relative to those acclimated for shorter periods regardless of rainbow trout density treatment (F-4,F-148.5=2.50, P=0.04). More research is needed to determine how predation rates will change in natural environments, under differing amounts of habitat and food resources and in the context of whole assemblages. However, if rainbow trout are introduced into the habitat of longnose dace, some predation on longnose dace is expected, even when rainbow trout have no previous experience with active prey.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  1     Total Times Cited:  1     Cited Reference Count:  30 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/eff.12173     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),predation;enclosure;laboratory;diet;BEHAVIORAL-RESPONSE;FORAGING MINNOWS;FOOD-HABITS;NATIVE FISH;RIVER;STREAM;SELECTION;MODEL;RISK;Prednisolone,,

However, understanding which antipredator mechanisms are lost through relaxed selection, and how they influence the ability of prey to respond to novel predatory threats, is limited. The varying effects on native lizard populations of the relatively recent and patchy history of mammalian introductions to New Zealand's islands provide an opportunity to examine the consequences of relaxed selection. We assess behavioural patterns and predator detection abilities of native lizards, using chemicals of native reptilian and introduced rodent predators as cues. Focal lizard populations were isolated from predatory mammals for up to 16 million years; some now co-occur with mammals, while others remain in mammal-free locations. A skink species that evolved with mammals and has recently been introduced to New Zealand is included for comparison. Lizard behavioural patterns were correlated with recent and historical experience of mammals. Lizards always isolated from mammals exhibited the most antipredator freeze behaviour, whereas one that coevolved with mammals exhibited greatest activity (movements). However, predator chemical cues did not induce specific antipredator responses in any species indicating that these behavioural patterns are not linked to chemosensory predator detection alone.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  4     Total Times Cited:  4     Cited Reference Count:  66 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.20417/nzjecol.43.10     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),antipredator behaviour;chemical cues;chemoreception;gecko;olfaction;predation;rat;relaxed selection;reptile;skink;ANTIPREDATOR BEHAVIOR;NAULTINUS-MANUKANUS;METABOLIC-RATE;CHEMICAL CUES;RECOGNITION;RESPONSES;GECKOS;COMMUNICATION;REPTILIA;RISK;New Zealand;Prednisolone;Lizards,,

Referring to such needs and abilities as aspects of partner quality, it follows that variation in the amount of help offered in a relationship could transmit information about partner quality. A plausible behaviour might then be to vary the investment in a partner according to available information about partner quality and to invest little in a partner who offers little in return. Thus, regulation of a relationship through communication of partner quality would tend to follow the principle of reciprocity. In an analysis of an iterated game where players have private information about their needs and abilities, I verify this possibility by describing an evolutionarily stable state space strategy, referred to as 'state-dependent reciprocity', entailing communication of partner quality. Although the evolution of cooperation has been studied in great detail, there has been no previous analysis of communication of needs and abilities in a relationship. It may well be that such communication is of major importance for the evolution of cooperative behaviour in nature.

If antipredator behavior is incorporated into such models it becomes very unlikely that prey death rate is a linear function of predator density. In addition, it is possible for the prey death rate to decrease, rather than increase, as a function of the population density of its predator. Decreasing predation rates may be common when the prey organism is attempting to accumulate resources for growth or reproduction. Decreasing predation rates are less likely when the prey organism is attempting to minimize mortality. These results and earlier ones on indirect effects generated by optimal foraging (Abrams 1984, 1991a, b) suggest that higher order interactions should be extremely common in natural communities.

Venomous snakes, which rely on an envenomating strike to kill prey, often feed on potentially dangerous prey such as rodents, and have the choice between two alternative strategies following a bite: they either hold onto prey until it is incapacitated, or release it immediately, relying on scent trailing to find the bitten prey. In this study, we combined observational and experimental data collected in the field in South Africa to test the hypothesis that prey type and size affected the predatory strategy of a venomous snake, the puff adder (Bitis arietans; Viperidae). Relative prey size, but not prey type, affected the snake's strategy: puff adders typically struck and held prey of small size (e.g., toads, small adult mice and shrews), but often struck and released larger prey (e.g., large adult mice and rats), presumably because retaliatory bites from the latter ones are more dangerous. Hence, puff adders discriminated according to prey size and adjusted their predatory strategy consequently. Contrary to the common belief that viperid snakes typically strike and release prey, our findings agree with empirical evidence found in the literature, that is, puff adders generally alter their predatory tactics based on prey size. Although a few laboratory studies have examined the theme of the present paper in other venomous snakes, our research was conducted in a natural setting and thus provides a better understanding of the factors used by predators to choose between alternative hunting strategies.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  8     Total Times Cited:  8     Cited Reference Count:  39 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/jzo.12450     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Bitis arietans;predatory strategy;foraging;predator-prey relationship;puff adder;prey size;venomous snakes;AMBUSH-FORAGING SNAKE;CROTALUS-V-VIRIDIS;PRAIRIE RATTLESNAKES;HANDLING BEHAVIOR;STRIKE BEHAVIOR;DANGEROUS PREY;OREGANUS;FOOD;Venoms,,

We quantified the probability and strength of changes in group sizes and dispersion as population density changed for each sex. We used group size data from a population of elk in Manitoba, Canada, that was experimentally reduced from 1.20 to 0.67 elk/km(2) between 2002 and 2009. Our results indicated that functional responses of group size to population density are sex-specific. Females showed a positive density-dependent response in group size at population densities >= 0.70 elk/km(2) and we found evidence for a minimum group size at population density <= 0.70 elk/km(2). Changes in male group size were also density-dependent; however, the strength of the relationship was lower than for females. Density dependence in male group size was predominantly a result of fusion of solitary males into larger groups, rather than fusion among existing groups. Our study revealed that density affects group size of a large herbivore differently between males and females, which has important implications for the benefits e.g., alleviating predation risk, and costs of social behaviors e. g., competition for resources and mates, and intra-specific pathogen transmission.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  26     Total Times Cited:  26     Cited Reference Count:  68 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1371/journal.pone.0053777     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),MOUNTAIN-NATIONAL-PARK;TEMPORAL VARIATION;PREDATION RISK;HERD SIZE;ELK;POPULATION;SEGREGATION;BEHAVIOR;DEER;RED,,

Receivers are typically assumed to have fitness returns that depend on their ability to determine the utility of the signaller to them. Each signaller must decide what level to signal at, which is a Function of the quality of the signaller. In addition, a signaller's quality is assumed to be synonymous with the signaller's utility to a receiver. However, there is no reason to believe that signalling costs are incurred in the same currency as the receivers are paid and, thus,, no reason to believe that the relationship between signaller quality and utility is linear or even increasing. For instance, in signalling between prey and predators. the utility of a prey item may bu its fat reserves, whereas an individual prey pays for signalling (and thus measures quality) in terms of increased risk of capture; quality and utility are synonymous only if a high risk of capture is associated with high fat reserves. In addition., several recent studies have documented increased signalling as utility decreases. IF utility and quality are decoupled, so that increasing quality does not always mean increasing utility, then traditional signalling models predict that no signalling equilibrium will exist. I show that if receiver fitness is modelled by a set of behavioural responses, which have both costs and benefits, then a signalling equilibrium can sometimes be recovered. An example of signalling between mates is presented in order to demonstrate this equilibrium.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  8     Total Times Cited:  8     Cited Reference Count:  22 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1098/rspb.2001.1804     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),sexual selection;female choice;spatial heterogeneity;join ESS;evolution;ACTION-RESPONSE GAMES;HANDICAP PRINCIPLE;EVOLUTION;ADVERTISEMENT;STRATEGIES;SELECTION;HONEST;CHOICE,,

We generated coarse-scale behavioral predictions based on these expectations that could be assessed with GPS radiotelemetry. We evaluated our predictions using an integrated step-selection analysis of wolverine (Gulo gulo luscus) space use in relation to spatially and temporally dynamic vehicle traffic on industrial roads in northern Alberta. We compared support for alternative models of road avoidance, increased speed near roads, and road avoidance and increased speed near roads. We predicted that wolverines would avoid roads and increase their speed near roads and that these behaviors would increase with traffic volume. We found that vehicle traffic was relatively low (0-30 vehicles/12 h) but important for explaining wolverine space use. Top winter and summer models indicated that wolverines avoided and increased speed near roads. Wolverine movement, but not avoidance, increased with traffic volume. We suggest that movement is a fine-scaled response that is more responsive to vehicle traffic than habitat selection. We show that roads, regardless of traffic volume, reduce the quality of wolverine habitats and that higher-traffic roads might be most deleterious. We suggest that wildlife behavior near roads should be viewed as a continuum and that accurate modeling of behavior when near roads requires quantification of both movement and habitat selection. Mitigating the effects of roads on wolverines would require clustering roads, road closures, or access management.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  26     Total Times Cited:  27     Cited Reference Count:  47 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1093/beheco/arx182     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),boreal forest;Gulo gulo;habitat selection;movement;oil extraction;roads;step selection;traffic volume;wolverine;RESOURCE SELECTION;ANTHROPOGENIC DISTURBANCE;BEHAVIOR;PATTERNS;FOREST;AVOIDANCE;RISK;DIET,,

We develop a model where generalist predators have consumptive effects (i. e., altering the likelihood of local prey extinction) as well as nonconsumptive effects (altering the likelihood of colonization) on spatially separated prey populations (metapopulations). We then extend this model to explore the effects of predators on competition among prey. We. find that generalist predators can promote persistence of prey metapopulations by promoting prey colonization, but predators can also hasten system-wide extinction by either increasing local extinction or reducing prey migration. By altering rates of prey migration, predators in one location can exert remote control over prey dynamics in another location via predator-mediated changes in prey flux. Thus, the effect of predators may extend well beyond the proportion of patches they visit. In the context of prey metacommunities, predator-mediated shifts in prey migration and mortality can shift the competition-colonization trade-off among competing prey, leading to changes in the prey community as well as changes in the susceptibility of prey species to habitat loss. Consequently, native prey communities may be susceptible to invasion not only by exotic prey species that experience reduced amounts of mortality from resident predators, but also by exotic prey species that exhibit strong dispersal in response to generalist native predators. Ultimately, our work suggests that the consumptive and nonconsumptive effects of generalist predators may have strong, yet potentially cryptic, effects on competing prey capable of mediating coexistence, fostering invasion, and interacting with anthropogenic habitat alteration.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  66     Total Times Cited:  66     Cited Reference Count:  53 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Included""}",10.1890/07-1024.1     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),behavior;competition;consumptive effects;habitat loss;invasion;metacommunity;metapopulation;migration;nonconsumptive effects;predator-prey interactions.;HABITAT DESTRUCTION;CONSPECIFIC ATTRACTION;DYNAMICS;RISK;CONSEQUENCES;COMMUNITIES;COEXISTENCE;DISTURBANCE;EXTINCTION;DEPENDENCE;Prednisolone;Mental Competency,,

Furthermore, the lifestyle of the host can impact tumor growth and quality of life. To approach these questions, we conducted novel experiments by letting C57BL/6 laboratory mice, with or without oral squamous cell carcinoma, free range in a large outdoor vivarium. Our goals were to: (1) determine whether one could conduct experiments with a mouse model under free range conditions, (2) measure effects of cancer burden on foraging metrics, (3) compare tumor growth rates with laboratory housed mice, and (4) begin to sort out confounding factors such as diet. With or without cancer, the C57BL/6 laboratory mice dealt with natural climatic conditions and illumination, found shelter or dug burrows, sought out food from experimental food patches, and responded to risk factors associated with microhabitat by foraging more thoroughly in food patches under bush (safe) than in the open (risky). We quantified foraging using giving-up densities of food left behind in the food patches. The mice's patch use changed over time, and was affected by disease status, sex, and microhabitat. Males, which were larger, consumed more food and had lower giving-up densities than females. Relative to cancer-free mice, mice with growing tumors lost weight, harvested more food, and increasingly relied on patches in the bush microhabitat. The tumors of free-ranging mice in the vivarium grew slower than those of their cohort that were housed in mouse cages in animal facilities. Numerous interesting factors could explain the difference in tumor growth rates: activity levels, stress, weather, food intake, diet, and more. To tease apart one of these intertwined factors, we found that tumors grew faster when mice in the laboratory were fed on millet rather than laboratory mouse chow. While just a start, these novel experiments and framework show how free-ranging mice provide a model that can test a broader range of hypotheses and use a broader range of metrics regarding cancer progression and its consequences for the host.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  74 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.3389/fevo.2021.741389     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),disease ecology;foraging ecology;foraging aptitudes;risk management;cancer;tradeoffs of food and safety;tumor growth rates;environmental effects;TUMOR-GROWTH;OWL PREDATION;PATCH USE;TIME ALLOCATION;MOUSE MODELS;RISK;BEHAVIOR;GERBILS;ENVIRONMENT;EXERCISE;Mice;Life Style,,

For animals in shallow aquatic habitats, encounters with terrestrial predators may represent such a situation. Terrestrial flight responses, acute movements from water onto land following a disturbance, may be a viable escape strategy during encounters with terrestrial predators foraging in shallow aquatic habitats. Sonoran mud turtles (Kinosternon sonoriense) occur in intermittent aquatic habitats in the Peloncillo Mountains, New Mexico. When Sonoran mud turtles were captured by hand in shallow pools or shallow stock tanks they frequently underwent terrestrial flight responses. In five of six trials in shallow stock tanks, and three of seven trials in shallow pools, turtles left the water within 20 min of being released, often climbing out of sight up relatively steep slopes. This behavior was not observed in four trials in which turtles were captured with hoop nets in deep stock tanks. Turtles that underwent terrestrial flight responses were significantly larger than non-responders. Terrestrial flight responses appear to be a risk aversion strategy in Sonoran mud turtles occupying shallow aquatic habitats. This unusual behavior may be widespread among animals that inhabit shallow aquatic habitats.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  5     Total Times Cited:  5     Cited Reference Count:  33 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1674/0003-0031-165.1.128     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),KINOSTERNON-SONORIENSE;PREDATION RISK;VERTICAL MIGRATION;ESTIVATION;BEHAVIOR;SIZE;INTIMIDATION;MOVEMENTS;ECOLOGY;DANGER,,

Furthermore, tadpoles of a few species are capable of learning, which can elicit or reinforce predator-avoidance behaviors. However, it remains unclear how widespread this capacity for learning is among anurans and whether it is biased in favor of evolutionarily familiar predators. Here, we test whether prior experiences will modify the behavioral response of Lowland Leopard Frog Lithobates (Rana) yavapaiensis tadpoles to Green Sunfish Lepomis cyanellus, a recently introduced predator. We exposed focal tadpoles for 10 days to the chemical and visual cues of one of three conditioning treatments: a cricket-fed Green Sunfish, a tadpole-fed Green Sunfish, or a control tank without predator. Subsequently, we measured the swimming activity of focal tadpoles in response to a neutral cue (water) and the chemical cues of Green Sunfish. No difference between conditioning treatments was observed in response to the water cue. In contrast, tadpoles that had previously experienced either of the sunfish conditioning treatments displayed significantly higher swimming activity than control tadpoles for 2-4 min after exposure to the sunfish chemical cues. Our results indicate that the behavior of tadpoles can be altered by prior experiences, even in the absence of alarm cues. In addition to providing another example of learning in tadpoles, our results suggest that tadpoles may have a broad learning template that can be applied to organisms with which they have recently come into contact.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  4     Total Times Cited:  4     Cited Reference Count:  45 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1670/09-025.1     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),CONSPECIFIC CHEMICAL CUES;2 ANURAN TADPOLES;TOAD TADPOLES;ANTIPREDATOR BEHAVIOR;TAIL SHAPE;RISK;PLASTICITY;AVOIDANCE;COSTS;RECOGNITION;Prednisolone,,

Refinement of risk assessment could occur if prey have the ability to assess cue age. Here, we test for antipredator behavioural responses to chemical alarm cues of varying ages. Fathead minnows, Pimephales promelas, give an antipredator response to alarm cues derived from conspecifc skin extract that has been aged at 18 degrees C for 0 (fresh) and 3 h, but not after 6 h. Alarm cues from crushed conspecific Gammarus lacustris (Crustacea: Amphipoda), showed a similar chemical longevity. A field test of minnow alarm cues produced broadly similar results for conspecific fathead minnows and heterospecific responses by northern redbelly dace, Phoxinus eos. Close agreement among all three data sets suggests either a common duration of predation risk or a common molecular basis of chemical cues across aquatic taxa. When we heated skin extract to denature and remove half of the constituent proteins, we inactivated biological activity of alarm cue suggesting that protein is required for skin extract to function as an alarm cue in minnows.

Moving to safer habitats allows prey to reduce the risk of mortality triggered by predation. This response has been well studied at the population level to assist in identifying key habitat components for wildlife conservation. However, while individuals may differ in their response to risk and thus in their survival expectancy, the determinants of individual adjustments in space and habitat use are largely unknown in management and conservation studies. Using GPS monitoring, we investigated the relationship between individual traits (morphometry, personality, health status) and adjustments in the use of space relative to risky features (hedgerows, roads/tracks, woodlands, built-up areas) with regard to predation risk. We used the gray partridge (Perdix perdix) as a study model (captive-reared birds released into the farmlands). During the diel cycle, predation risk mainly occurs by carnivores at night, whereas human hunting pressure occurs during the day. We found that personality and health status had an effect on adjustments in the use of space as response to risky features. At night, when carnivore activity is expected to be high, bolder individuals were farther from hedgerows relative to the day. Similarly, individuals in good health were located farther from hedgerows, roads/tracks, and woodland at night relative to the day. We discuss the need for better consideration of individual traits in management and conservation programs, with a particular focus on recovery programs that rely on translocation of captive-reared individuals.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  129 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s10344-021-01526-x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Behavioral adjustment;Gray partridge;Health status;Personality;Space use;Wildlife management;RED-LEGGED PARTRIDGE;PREDATION RISK;ANTIPREDATOR BEHAVIOR;GREY PARTRIDGE;INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES;EXPLORATORY-BEHAVIOR;AVIAN PERSONALITIES;ANIMAL TEMPERAMENT;TEMPORAL VARIATION;BREEDING SUCCESS,,

We compare differences in vegetation between sites occupied by the lesser prairie-chicken (Tympanuchus pallidicinctus) and random sites to investigate composition of grasses and forbs and the importance of cover. We observed that birds selected habitat, at least in part, based on composition of grasses and forbs. There was generally a larger variance in diversity of plants for random sites compared to sites associated with presence of lesser prairie-chicken. The role of vegetative cover in selection of habitat is important for avoidance of predators, but use of cover also is a means of thermoregulation. Risk-sensitive behavior is a trade-off between avoiding predation and suitable microclimate. We report evidence that the lesser prairie-chicken consistently seeks to limit the risk of predation and selects locales with a favorable microclimate; birds select sites more or less exposed depending on apparent temperature. We infer that selection of habitat by the lesser prairie-chicken is the result of composition of species of plants, avoidance of predators, and thermoregulation, with the lekking mating system of this bird also playing a role. This declining species might face increasing threats as some practices of land management alter structure of vegetation and reduce shrub cover.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  10     Total Times Cited:  11     Cited Reference Count:  65 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1894/0038-4909-58.2.135     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),TYMPANUCHUS-PALLIDICINCTUS;SAND SAGEBRUSH;GREAT-PLAINS;VEGETATIVE CHARACTERISTICS;INVERTEBRATE BIOMASS;NESTING ECOLOGY;BIRD RESPONSE;BROOD HABITAT;CONSERVATION;PHYSIOGNOMY;Chickens,,

Here we employ a combination of surveys and a non-invasive tethering technique to examine these patterns in an intact coral reef system on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). We also assess local scale variation in relative diurnal predation pressure. Surveys revealed that sea urchins were active and exposed at night. Echinometra mathaei and Echinothrix calamaris were the most abundant species with significantly higher night densities (0.21 and 0.03 ind. m(-2), respectively), than daytime densities (0.05 and 0.001, respectively). Bioassays revealed that exposed adult E. mathaei (the most abundant sea urchin species) were 30.8 times more likely to be eaten during the day than at night when controlling for sites. This observation concurs with widely held assumptions that nocturnal activity is a risk-related adaptive response to diurnal predation pressure. Despite relatively intact predator communities on the GBR, potential predation pressure on diurnally exposed E. mathaei assays was variable at a local scale and the biomass of potential fish predators at each site was a poor predictive measure of this variation. Patterns in predation appear to be more complex and variable than we may have assumed.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  22     Total Times Cited:  22     Cited Reference Count:  45 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s00338-011-0754-2     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Coral reefs;Sea urchin;Predation;Echinometra mathaei;Tethering;Ecosystem function;KENYAN CORAL-REEF;ECHINOMETRA-MATHAEI;DIADEMA-ANTILLARUM;STRONGYLOCENTROTUS-DROEBACHIENSIS;ECHINOID BIOEROSION;FORAGING PATTERNS;STRUCTURING FORCE;CLIMATE-CHANGE;BEHAVIOR;RESILIENCE;Prednisolone,,

Here, the pelagic water column is divided into two layers namely, the upper layer and the lower layer. The zooplankton population makes a diel vertical migration (DVM) from lower portion to upper portion and vice-versa to trade-off between food source and fear from predator (Fish). Here, mathematical model has been developed and analyzed in a rigorous way. Apart from routine calculations like boundedness and positivity of the solution, local stability of the equilibrium points, we performed Hopf bifurcation analysis of the interior equilibrium point of our model system in a systematic way. It is observed that the migratory behavior of zooplankton plays a crucial role in the dynamics of the model system. Both the upward and downward migration rates of DVM leads the system into Hopf bifurcation. The upward migration rate of zooplankton deteriorates the stable coexistence of all the species in the system, whereas the downward migration rate enhance the stability of the system. Further, we analyze the non-autonomous version of the system to capture seasonal effect of environmental variations. We have shown that under certain parametric restrictions periodic coexistence of all the species of our system is possible. Finally, extensive numerical simulation has been performed to support our analytical findings.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  6     Total Times Cited:  6     Cited Reference Count:  49 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Included""}",10.1142/S1793524519500827     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Food chain model;DVM;Hopf bifurcation;limit cycle;periodic solution;global attractor;POSITIVE PERIODIC-SOLUTION;DIEL VERTICAL MIGRATION;ADAPTIVE SIGNIFICANCE;PREDATOR;ZOOPLANKTON;DAPHNIA;DELAY;AVAILABILITY;BEHAVIOR;PLANKTON,,

The harpy eagle Harpia harpyja is the largest living eagle, and is considered Near Threatened by the IUCN. Its main threats are persecution by humans and habitat loss. Predation patterns of this species have been the subject of several descriptive studies, each reflecting the idiosyncrasies of the study area. Systematizing these data permits a transition from descriptive treatments of harpy food habits to a predictive focus, based on defensive prey strategies and foraging theory. This generates information that can enhance management and conservation decisions. Literature data were summarized and standardized, allowing comparison between studies. Results indicate that harpy eagles feed mainly on sloths and other prey with passive antipredator strategies, with sloths accounting for 50% of prey items and biomass consumed. Large monkeys such as howlers (Alouatta spp.) and capuchins (Sapajus and Cebus spp.) are the next most important prey, but combined, primates form only similar to 20% of the consumed prey biomass. Predation seldom occurs on animals weighing more than 5 kg. This is positive from a conservation point of view, since sloths are not game species, precluding competition between harpy eagles and subsistence hunting.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  12     Total Times Cited:  12     Cited Reference Count:  93 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.3354/esr00700     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),BRAZILIAN ATLANTIC FOREST;BODY-SIZE;POPULATION-DENSITY;PREY PREFERENCES;EXTINCTION RISK;BEHAVIOR;DIET;HABITAT;FOOD;PRIMATE;Prednisolone,,

Whether or not individuals share a suitable shelter or, conversely, exclude conspecifics may depend on associated costs (resource partitioning, sexual harassment, disease or parasite contamination) and benefits (predation risk dilution, thermal resilience, information sharing). We performed two experiments on field caught wall lizards (Podarcis muralis), a highly territorial species, to investigate the relative roles of sex and body size in night sheltering. In the first experiment, random pairs of lizards were offered two identical shelters. Lizards either shared a shelter, or sheltered separately. In the second experiment, different random pairs of lizards were offered only one shelter so as to elicit a share or compete response. Body size and sex both appeared as significant drivers for sheltering patterns. Unexpectedly, wall lizards often chose to share shelters. When only one shelter (too small to accommodate two adult lizards) was available, many lizards rejected the sheltering option in preference for aggregation. Such aggregative behaviour was not sex dependant, and may reflect thermoregulatory or anti-predatory benefits. Our results nevertheless suggest that cooperative behaviour may exist in wall lizards.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  2     Total Times Cited:  2     Cited Reference Count:  64 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1163/1568539X-00003222     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),competition;cooperation;lacertid;night shelter;body size;sex;SOCIAL AGGREGATIONS;GROUPING BEHAVIOR;LIFE-HISTORY;EGERNIA;SKINK;EVOLUTION;SELECTION;ECOLOGY;AGGRESSION;GAME;Lizards;Mental Competency,,

We identify how defaunation, operating at a variety of scales, from the plot to the global level, affects biological systems along a gradient of processes ranging from plant physiology (vegetative and reproductive performance) and animal behavior (movement, foraging and dietary patterns) in the immediate term; to plant population and community dynamics and structure leading to disruptions of ecosystem functioning (and thus degrading environmental services) in the short to medium term; to evolutionary changes (phenotypic changes and population genetic structure) in the long-term.

Rival males compete for control of harems via ritualized displays or direct combat using weaponry. Contests for harems or the resources required by females can be settled based on asymmetries in fighting ability or resource ownership. Males that accurately assess a rival's fighting ability prior to engaging in potentially costly combat should be favoured by selection. Game theory and optimality models provide three models to explain how individuals decide to persist in or flee from a fight. These models are the energetic war of attrition, the sequential assessment model and the cumulative assessment model. Using staged contests in the laboratory, I tested predictions of these models using the Wellington tree weta, Hemideina crassidens, a sexually dimorphic insect native to New Zealand. Male H. crassidens use their enlarged mandibles as weapons in fights for access to adult females that reside in cavities in trees. My results supported a prediction common to each assessment model: contest duration was negatively correlated with the asymmetry in opponent's weapon size. The sequential assessment model of contest settlement was partially supported but the strongest support was for the cumulative assessment model. Predictions of the latter model were supported because: (1) fights are apparently settled based on own-size assessment; (2) fights occur in a single phase and escalate; and (3) contests involve physical combat and injury. I suggest that, in nocturnal species, cumulative assessment will generally be most applicable. (c) 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This paper analyses the optimal trade-off between food and predation. We are primarily interested in how an animal's decisions and its state change over time. Our models are very general. They can be applied to growth decisions, such as choice of habitat, in which case we might consider how the state variable size changes over an animal's lifetime. Equally our models are applicable to short-term foraging decisions, such as vigilance level, in which case we might consider how energy reserves vary over a day. We concentrate on two cases: (i) the animal must reach a fixed state, its fitness depending on when this is attained; (ii) the animal must survive to a fixed time, its fitness depending on its final state.        In case (i) minimization of mortality per unit increase of state is optimal under certain baseline conditions. In case (ii) behaviour is constant over time under baseline conditions (the 'Risk-spreading Theorem'). We analyse how these patterns are modified by complicating factors, e.g. time penalties, premature termination of the food supply, stochasticity in food supply or in metabolic expenditure, and state-dependence in the ability to obtain food, in metabolic expenditure and in predation risk. From this analysis we obtain a variety of possible explanations for why an animal should reduce its intake rate over time (i.e. show satiation).

Impacts to mule deer are of particular concern because some of the largest gas fields in the USA overlap critical winter ranges. Short-term studies of 2-3 years have shown that mule deer and other ungulates avoid energy infrastructure; however, there remains a common perception that ungulates habituate to energy development, and thus, the potential for a demographic effect is low. We used telemetry data from 187 individual deer across a 17-year period, including 2 years predevelopment and 15 years during development, to determine whether mule deer habituated to natural gas development and if their response to disturbance varied with winter severity. Concurrently, we measured abundance of mule deer to indirectly link behavior with demography. Mule deer consistently avoided energy infrastructure through the 15-year period of development and used habitats that were an average of 913 m further from well pads compared with predevelopment patterns of habitat use. Even during the last 3 years of study, when most wells were in production and reclamation efforts underway, mule deer remained >1 km away from well pads. The magnitude of avoidance behavior, however, was mediated by winter severity, where aversion to well pads decreased as winter severity increased. Mule deer abundance declined by 36% during the development period, despite aggressive onsite mitigation efforts (e.g. directional drilling and liquid gathering systems) and a 45% reduction in deer harvest. Our results indicate behavioral effects of energy development on mule deer are long term and may affect population abundance by displacing animals and thereby functionally reducing the amount of available habitat.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  46     Total Times Cited:  46     Cited Reference Count:  59 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/gcb.13711     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),"avoidance behavior;disturbance;indirect habitat loss;land-use planning;mitigation;HABITAT SELECTION PATTERNS;BEHAVIORAL-RESPONSES;PREDATION;CARIBOU;DISTURBANCE;MOVEMENTS;RISK;Habituation, Psychophysiologic",,

Here we explore the evolutionary consequences of a trade-off that arises naturally between mate acquisition and risk of predation and study evolution of the rate at which male prey search for mates in a population subject to a mate-finding Allee effect and exposed to either generalist or specialist predators. Since we show that the mate search rate determines the strength of the mate finding Allee effect, we can alternatively view this as evolution of the mate-finding Allee effect in prey. We contrast two different life histories and find that, predominantly, male prey either evolve towards the maximal mate search rate yielding the weakest possible mate-finding Allee effect (thus showing no adaptive response in mating behaviour to predation risk) or evolutionary bi-stability occurs. In the latter case, males evolve a relatively low mate search rate (hence a relatively strong mate-finding Allee effect, interpreted as an adaptive response of male prey to predation) when initially slow or the maximal mate search rate when initially fast. Disruptive selection does not occur in populations exposed to generalist predators but is possible when predators are specialists. The dimorphic phase, in which fast and conspicuous male prey coexist with slow and cryptic ones, is however but a transient in evolutionary dynamics as one branch goes extinct while the other evolves towards the maximal mate search rate.

In lotic ecosystems, interstitial spaces in the substrate are important refugia for small organisms. Some predators are ecosystem engineers that exhibit zoogeomorphic agency-the ability to modify the geomorphology of their environment. It is therefore possible that direct ecological effects of predators on prey may be realized through modifications to the prey's habitat, including the availability of refugia, by predators that are zoogeomorphic agents or via external stressors such as fine sediment loading. This study examined three research questions in a mesocosm study across a gradient of sediment-stress treatments: (1) What affects do predators (Pacifastacus leniusculus, invasive crayfish) and prey (Gammarus pulex, amphipods) have on the ingress of fine sediment into gravel substrates and therefore on available interstitial refugia? (2) Do prey taxa seek refuge from (invasive) predators in the form of vertical movement into subsurface sediments? and (3) How does fine sediment ingress influence predator-prey interactions and prey survival through predator avoidance behavior. Here, we provide direct evidence demonstrating that fine sediment ingress into gravel river beds can be facilitated by zoogeomorphic activity with P. leniusculus increasing the infiltration of fine sand particles (but not coarse sand) during foraging activities. Predator-prey interactions were found to be a primary factor mediating zoogeomorphic activity, with the isolation of crayfish from prey (G. pulex) leading to increased fine sand ingress. When present with signal crayfish, G. pulex displayed vertical avoidance behavior, entering subsurface substrates to evade predation by P. leniusculus. Coarse sand treatments resulted in higher predation rates of G. pulex, most likely due to clogging of interstitial pore spaces between gravels limiting the effectiveness of the prey's vertical avoidance behavior strategy. A new conceptual model that captures the interactions between predator, prey, zoogeomorphic processes and habitat availability is presented. This model highlights how predator-prey interactions can be strongly mediated by dynamic bi-directional interactions between organisms and the physical environment they inhabit as ecological and geomorphological processes are intrinsically linked.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  9     Total Times Cited:  9     Cited Reference Count:  91 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1002/ecs2.2545     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),amphipods;crayfish;ecosystem engineering;fine sediment;hyporheic zone;ingress;invasive species;lotic invertebrates;predator avoidance behavior;refuge;sediment transport;zoogeomorphology;CRAYFISH PACIFASTACUS-LENIUSCULUS;GAMMARUS SPP.

Birds were released at two sites in Scotland (not concurrently) from 1997 to 2003 and monitored via spring and autumn counts, night-time surveys and radio-telemetry. Some wild female partridges were caught and radio-tagged each spring for comparison with reared females. The survival rate of 520 captive-reared birds released in autumn until the following spring was poor (around 10% overall) and was not significantly different for radio-tagged and visibly-marked birds. Carrying a radiotag did not alter the body condition of the birds. The breeding-season survival rate of released hens averaged 30% and was not significantly different to that of 44% for wild hens. However, the power to detect significant differences was low due to the small number of survivors. The major cause of mortality throughout was predation (82 and 55% of losses at the two sites), with red foxes Vulpes vulpes and raptors being the most significant predators. Reared partridges at the study site with legal predator control had higher survival rates than those at the other site, but this was not true for wild hens as raptor predation compensated for declining mammalian predation rates (19% of deaths were due to raptors at the site without predator control, 56% at the site with predator control). We suggest that the vulnerability to predation of reared birds was most likely due to inappropriate antipredator behaviour or an increased risk of predation near to release pens. Of the partridges that survived long enough to breed, three times more wild hens reached incubation than reared hens. No reared hens raised chicks in their first breeding season whilst the only hen that survived long enough to breed in her second year raised 14 young. Captive-reared grey partridges could not be used to increase the species' range unless 1) the number surviving their first year increased, 2) the higher breeding rate of two-year-old females suggested here was ubiquitous, and unless 3) appropriate management was in place first.

It is proven that the pest adopts several mechanisms for overcoming the predation pressure. Two such techniques which are not well studied in the literature are group defence, anti-predator behaviour in prey. Anti-predator behaviour of prey is a counterattacking technique, in which adult prey attacks the juvenile predators to reduce the future predation pressure. From the existing experimental studies, it is observed that the anti-predator behaviour of the pest can have adverse effects on the biological control programmes. One of the ways to overcome the loss due to anti-predator behaviour is to cater the predators with some alternative food. In this current work, we have investigated this aspect in a dynamical system framework. This study uncovers many fascinating phenomena. It is found that the considered system displays rich dynamics and demonstrates various bifurcations such as saddle-node bifurcation, (supercritical and subcritical) Hopf bifurcation, homoclinic bifurcation and a Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation of co-dimension 2 are studied. Treating the anti-predator behaviour in prey as one of the control parameters, and by characterising the additional food supplied to the predators, the strategies for achieving the successful biological control are derived.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  12     Total Times Cited:  12     Cited Reference Count:  92 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Maybe""}",10.1007/s11071-019-04883-0     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Biological control;Pest;Predator;Additional food;Anti-predator behaviour;Hopf bifurcation;Homoclinic orbit;Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation;ALTERNATIVE FOOD;SUGAR CONCENTRATION;BIOLOGICAL-CONTROL;FEEDING FREQUENCY;PHYTOSEIID MITES;NATURAL ENEMIES;GROUP DEFENSE;CANNIBALISM;MODEL;RISK;Food Additives;Prednisolone,,

Disturbance due to hunting can lead to avoidance of wintering areas or have an impact on population dynamics owing to behavioural changes. We studied the impact of disturbance on 54 radio-tagged woodcocks under an experimental framework. The birds were allocated to the following three groups: simulated hunting disturbance (controlled disturbance; CD), hunted (H) and control (C). We studied the following four behavioural elements: space use, activity duration, number of commuting flights and date of spring migration departure. We found no differences in behavioural responses between the groups except for space use. A majority of CD birds used larger ranges during daytime than did H and C birds but did not change their nocturnal sites. To a large extent, this nocturnal site fidelity likely accounted for the weak disturbance effect, in so far as food intake was ensured. Our study underlines the importance of permanent meadows in the surroundings of forests to help this species to better withstand hunting disturbance.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  4     Total Times Cited:  4     Cited Reference Count:  71 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.2981/11-058     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),behaviour;Eurasian woodcock;experimental design;habitat management;hunting disturbance;Scolopax rusticola;space use;POPULATION CONSEQUENCES;BEHAVIORAL-RESPONSES;EXPERIMENTAL REFUGES;MIGRATORY WATERFOWL;ENERGY-EXPENDITURE;DANISH WETLANDS;PREDATION RISK;FOREST BIRDS;MANAGEMENT;WATERBIRDS,,

This phenotypic plasticity could be beneficial for stock enhancement because such plasticity suggests potential for change with adjustments to rearing protocols to achieve improved ecological competence. We examine how specific plastic responses can affect crustacean ecology through effects on predation, foraging, competition, and reproduction. For developing stock enhancement programmes, we recommend consideration of plastic phenotypic patterns before large-scale releases are initiated. Researchers can identify environmental factors that cue plasticity during hatchery rearing, determine if induced responses are ecologically influential after release into the wild, and examine the temporal scale on which phenotypic plasticity operates. Communal hatchery rearing at low-to-medium stocking densities with predator cues and natural substrates along with in situ conditioning, releases during periods of low predation risk, and coupled laboratory-field studies can contribute to improved ecological performance during stock enhancement. Finally, presentation of non-significant research results is needed to avoid bias towards hatchery-wild differences and help guide future conditioning programmes.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  6     Total Times Cited:  6     Cited Reference Count:  152 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1093/icesjms/fsaa043     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),conditioning;ecological competence;phenotypic plasticity;release strategy;stock enhancement;LOBSTER HOMARUS-AMERICANUS;RED KING CRAB;PARALITHODES-CAMTSCHATICUS TILESIUS;CLAW CLOSER MUSCLES;BENTHIC PHASE RED;WILD BLUE CRABS;JUVENILE RED;CALLINECTES-SAPIDUS;EUROPEAN LOBSTERS;ECOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES;Phenotype,,

Free-ranging animals, however, adjust energy intake in accordance with their energy reserves, a behavior known as state-dependent foraging. Further, links between life-history strategies and metabolic allometries cause energy intake and energy reserves to be more strongly coupled in small animals relative to large animals. Because GC and T3 may reflect energy intake or energy reserves, state-dependent foraging and body size may cause endocrine-energy relationships to vary among taxa and environments. To extend the utility of endocrine markers to large-bodied, free-ranging animals, we evaluated how state-dependent foraging, energy reserves, and energy intake influenced fecal GC and fecal T3 concentrations in free-ranging moose (Alces alces). Compared with individuals possessing abundant energy reserves, individuals with few energy reserves had higher energy intake and high fecal T3 concentrations, thereby supporting state-dependent foraging. Although fecal GC did not vary strongly with energy reserves, individuals with higher fecal GC tended to have fewer energy reserves and substantially greater energy intake than those with low fecal GC. Consequently, individuals with greater energy intake had both high fecal T3 and high fecal GC concentrations, a pattern inconsistent with previous documentation from captive animal studies. We posit that a positive relationship between GC and T3 may be expected in animals exhibiting state-dependent foraging if GC is associated with increased foraging and energy intake. Thus, we recommend that additional investigations of GC- and T3-energy relationships be conducted in free-ranging animals across a diversity of body size and life-history strategies before these endocrine markers are applied broadly to wildlife conservation and management.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  11     Total Times Cited:  11     Cited Reference Count:  92 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1002/eap.1608     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),conservation physiology;endocrinology;energy intake;energy reserves;glucocorticoids;large herbivore;moose (Alces alces);nutrition;ruminant;state-dependent foraging behavior;stress;triiodothyronine;WHITE-TAILED DEER;THYROID-HORMONE METABOLISM;FOOD AVAILABILITY;GROWTH-HORMONE;LIFE-HISTORY;PHYSIOLOGICAL STRESS;MAMMALIAN HERBIVORES;POPULATION PROCESSES;NUTRITIONAL STRESS;PREDATION RISK,,

Diminished anti-predator behavior is among the most-studied causes of indirect mortality during infection, particularly for systems in which a parasite's life-cycle requires transmission from prey to predator. Significantly less work has examined whether directly-transmitted parasites and pathogens also reduce anti-predator behaviors. Here we test whether the directly-transmitted bacterial pathogen, Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG), reduces responses to predation-related stimuli in house finches Haemorhous mexicanus. MG causes conjunctivitis and reduces survival among free-living finches, but rarely causes mortality in captivity, suggesting a role for indirect mechanisms. Wild-caught finches were individually housed in captivity and exposed to the following treatments: 1) visual presence of a stuffed, mounted predator (a Cooper's hawk Accipiter cooperii) or control object (a vase or a stuffed, mounted mallard duck Anas platyrhynchos), 2) vocalizations of the same predator and non-predator, 3) approach of a researcher to enclosures, and 4) simulated predator attack (capture by hand). MG infection reduced anti-predator responses during visual exposure to a mounted predator and simulated predator attack, even for birds without detectable visual obstruction from conjunctivitis. However, MG infection did not significantly alter responses during human approach or audio playback. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that predation plays a role in MG-induced mortality in the wild, with reduced locomotion, a common form of sickness behavior for many taxa, as a likely mechanism. Our results therefore suggest that additional research on the role of sickness behaviors in predation could prove illuminating.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  25     Total Times Cited:  26     Cited Reference Count:  59 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/jav.01058     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),MYCOPLASMA-GALLISEPTICUM INFECTION;SEASONAL-VARIATION;SICKNESS BEHAVIOR;PREDATION RISK;RESPONSES;DISEASE;POPULATION;BIRDS;PREY;VULNERABILITY;Prednisolone,,

The refuge used by species having a strong Allee effect may affect their predation and hence extinction risk.

In this paper, we have studied the impact of a constant prey refuge on the dynamics of a ratio-dependent predator-prey system with strong Allee effect in prey growth. The stability analysis of the model has been carried out, and a comprehensive bifurcation analysis is presented. It is found that if prey refuge is less than the Allee threshold, the incorporation of prey refuge increases the threshold values of the predation rate and conversion efficiency at which unconditional extinction occurs. Moreover, if the prey refuge is greater than the Allee threshold, situation of unconditional extinction may not occur. It is found that at a critical value of prey refuge, which is greater than the Allee threshold but less than the carrying capacity of prey population, system undergoes cusp bifurcation and the rich spectrum of dynamics exhibited by the system disappears if the prey refuge is increased further.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  13     Total Times Cited:  13     Cited Reference Count:  39 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Included""}",10.1007/s11538-018-0394-6     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Predator-prey system;Allee effect;Ratio dependent;Prey refuge;Bifurcation;GLOBAL DYNAMICS;BIFURCATIONS;STABILITY;Prednisolone,,

Objective: We examined correlations between anti-predator behaviour and morphology in threespine stickleback fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus) in four environments distinguished by their predation histories: marine/anadromous populations co-existing with native predatory fish (representative of the ancestral environment), and three freshwater environments with native, introduced, and no predatory fish, respectively. To determine whether morphological and behavioural defences reinforce one another (trait co-specialization) or whether they represent alternative strategies for defence (trait compensation), we related morphology of laboratory-reared stickleback to the intensity of their responses to a simulated predator attack, which had previously been assessed (Wund et al., 2015).        Methods: Eight aspects of stickleback morphology were measured, all of which loaded heavily and positively on a single principal component that accounted for 61.3% of the variation in traits. Pearson correlation was used to determine whether PC1 was associated with the intensity of anti-predator response.        Results: A weak negative correlation was observed between anti-predator behaviour and morphology overall. However, considering each predation environment separately revealed that populations from marine and freshwater environments containing native predatory fish displayed trait co-specialization (positive correlation) between armour and behaviour, while those from environments with recently introduced predatory trout displayed trait compensation (negative correlation). No correlation was observed in populations lacking these predators. Not all populations within the 'introduced predatory fish' category showed the same pattern of relationship, however, indicating that additional factors mediate the co-evolutionary dynamics of anti-predator behaviour and morphology. Results were similar whether we considered sizestandardized or unstandardized morphological traits.        Conclusion: Our results suggest that over the long term, the two types of defence co-evolve to reinforce one another, but within the first few decades of exposure to predatory fish, antipredator behaviour compensates for diminished morphological defences.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  2     Total Times Cited:  2     Cited Reference Count:  76 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",,anti-predator;behaviour;compensation;co-specialization;morphology;threespine stickleback;FRESH-WATER POPULATIONS;ANTIPREDATOR BEHAVIOR;3-SPINED STICKLEBACKS;ADAPTIVE DIVERGENCE;TRINIDADIAN GUPPIES;REVERSED SELECTION;RAPID EVOLUTION;PREDATION RISK;RESPONSES;LAKE,,

Bird behavior is represented in a spatially explicit agent-based model that tracks responses of individuals to predicted changes in local habitat quantity and quality. We apply this framework to the endangered California clapper rail (Rallus longirostris obsoletus) in the San Francisco Estuary, US, under a range of sea-level rise and conservation scenarios aimed at clapper rail recovery. The framework enables quantification of the relationship between critical habitat destruction and clapper rail population decline. The most influential factors that characterize the quality of tidal marsh habitat are salinity, which is a proxy for higher quality nesting environment and abundance of macroinvertebrates, and tidal conditions, which affect flood and predation threats. Results suggest that clapper rail viability should remain at the present level for moderate sea level rise. However, for a rise of 1.66 m, extinction risk increases from 0.01 to 0.36. The framework enables quantitative evaluation of proposed conservation efforts, and should complement existing theory and empirical inferences. Compared with sub-regional efforts, estuary-wide conservation is more effective in improving reproduction and dispersal success and accommodates a sea-level rise of an additional 10 cm before population falls below criticality. Should sea level rise to the predicted maximum, proposed conservation efforts are likely to be ineffective in preventing California clapper rail extinction by 2100. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Unfortunately, several native salmonid populations are threatened or at risk of extinction. Despite this, little is known about the behavior and survival of these fish as the juveniles transition from freshwater to the ocean. Our primary objectives were to estimate survival of juvenile steelhead migrating between trapping sites and the ocean and evaluate whether survival in the estuary varies temporally (within a year) or spatially (within and between estuaries) within the same distinct population segment. We also evaluated whether flow or fork length were correlated with survival and collected information on variables that have been demonstrated to affect smolt survival in other studies to lend insight regarding differences in survival estimates between basins. We compared run timing, migration rate, survival, condition factor, age composition and time of residence in the estuary for steelhead outmigrants from each basin and measured parasite loads in outmigrating steelhead to evaluate potential differences in parasite density and parasite community between basins. In 2009, we implanted acoustic transmitters in 139 wild steelhead smolts in two small rivers on the Oregon Coast. In general, only 40-50 % of the wild steelhead smolts tagged at upstream smolt traps were detected entering the ocean. The majority of mortality occurred in the lower estuary near the ocean. Wild steelhead smolts typically spent less than 1 day in the estuary in both basins. Using similar data from previous studies in the Nehalem and Alsea basins, we showed that survival appears to be negatively correlated with flow in most releases, and in 2009 fork length was not correlated with survival. Our observations provide baseline information on factors that could influence smolt survival through the estuary as well as smolt to adult survival in these basins, and emphasize the importance of monitoring smolt survival in the estuary.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  29     Total Times Cited:  30     Cited Reference Count:  46 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s10641-012-0080-8     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Survival;Smolt;Estuary;Acoustic;Telemetry;Flow;NANOPHYETUS-SALMINCOLA;MARINE SURVIVAL;CHINOOK SALMON;COLUMBIA RIVER;PACIFIC SALMON;MORTALITY;PREDATION;MIGRATION;FISH;PERSISTENCE;Oregon,,

Here we use a phylogenetic comparative analysis to test the association between several putative anti-predator traits and bird predation risk in an assemblage of caterpillar species. We synthesize eight years of field and laboratory study of a temperate forest community, including a four-year bird exclusion experiment that provided comparative measures of bird predation risk for 38 caterpillar species from a phylogenetic community. We then conducted a phylogenetic generalized least-squares and information-theoretic model selection analysis of warning signals (aposematism or mimicry), camouflage (crypsis or masquerade), and behavioral responses to physical attack as predictors of bird predation, while also accounting for putatively important effects of the abundance, mean body size, and phenology of caterpillar species. The most behaviorally specialized caterpillar species possessing warning signals experienced the lowest bird predation risk, supporting aposematism theory and highlighting the role of prey behavior in the visual signaling of predators. Among the camouflaged caterpillar species, those with the greatest latency to detection by human proxy predators experienced the lowest bird predation risk, supporting camouflage theory. Caterpillar behavioral responses to physical attack, however, predicted increased bird predation risk among camouflaged caterpillars. Although caterpillar abundance, body size, and phenology were expected to be important based on inference from optimal foraging theory and previous field observations, these factors had limited predictive power. This study provides methodologically unique evidence for the importance of morphological and behavioral components of primary, visual defenses of caterpillars against their avian predators in a natural community.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  18     Total Times Cited:  18     Cited Reference Count:  48 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/oik.01515     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),PARUS-MAJOR;EVOLUTION;BEHAVIOR;COLOR;DIET;FOOD;GREGARIOUSNESS;STRATEGIES;SELECTION;PATTERNS;Prednisolone,,

Here, we tested the effect of group size on the efficacy of predator recognition learning via injured conspecific cues or social learning, using fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) as our test species. First, minnows from three group sizes (one, two or four fish) were conditioned to recognize a novel rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) as risky through a single pairing of conspecific alarm cues with trout odour. They were then individually tested for the recognition of trout odour alone. No effect of group size was found on the learned response to trout odour, suggesting that group size does not interfere with the individual assessment of risk via alarm cues. During the conditioning, however, singletons displayed a stronger antipredator response compared to fish in groups, suggesting a context-dependent modulation of their antipredator response intensity due to a dilution effect. Fish that had the opportunity to learn to recognize a trout socially from either one or three experienced conspecifics also responded with the same intensity of antipredator response to the trout odour when tested alone. We hypothesize that the dilution of risk due to the increase of group size balanced the increase of tutor-to-observer ratio when observers directly interacted with tutor(s). This study highlights the potentially conflicting information that may be perceived by social individuals during both individual and social predation learning.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  4     Total Times Cited:  4     Cited Reference Count:  64 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s00265-015-1905-1     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Group size effect;Alarm cue learning;Dilution effect;Social learning;Pimephales promelas;CHEMICAL ALARM CUES;MINNOWS PIMEPHALES-PROMELAS;FATHEAD MINNOWS;ANTIPREDATOR BEHAVIOR;ACQUIRED PREDATOR;SHOAL SIZE;PREY INTERACTIONS;RISK-ASSESSMENT;OBSERVER RATIO;RECOGNITION;Learning;Prednisolone,,

We studied the use of anti-predator behavior by Western Sandpipers (Calidris mauri) at Bahia Santa Maria, northwestern Mexico, foraging in three habitats that differed in presumed predation danger. Brackish flats are completely open, making them theoretically less dangerous for feeding sandpipers than mangroves and cattail marshes, which have closer visual horizons. Western Sandpipers are sexually dimorphic, with females about 15% longer-billed and 10% heavier than males. We previously showed that male and female sandpipers differed in their habitat choice and relative body mass in ways consistent with differential responses to predation danger (Fernandez and Lank in Condor 108:547-557, 2006). Contrary to expectations, however, females were overrepresented in more dangerous habitats. Here, we examine differential usage across habitats and between the sexes of three anti-predator tactics-flock size, density within flocks, and vigilance rate-that may be used cumulatively to reinforce safety, or as trade-offs that compensate for levels of usage of each. We hypothesized, and found, that ordered differences occur among habitats, and that controlling for other factors, females were more cautious than males. For the most part, the use of these three tactics appeared to be cumulative, rather than compensatory. However, with respect to habitat use, birds appeared to compensate for the higher probability of mortality intrinsic to the use of higher-danger habitats by increasing the use of vigilance, foraging in tighter flocks, and maintaining lighter body weights (females only). Thus, both cumulative and compensatory processes operate among anti-predator tactics to determine the net level of safety and trade-off against other factors.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  6     Total Times Cited:  6     Cited Reference Count:  56 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s10336-010-0507-y     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Habitat quality;Local distribution;Predation danger;Sexual dimorphism;Shorebirds;REDSHANK TRINGA-TOTANUS;SPARROWHAWKS ACCIPITER-NISUS;PREDATION RISK;STOPOVER SITE;FLOCKING BEHAVIOR;RAPTOR PREDATION;SEMIPALMATED SANDPIPERS;MIGRATING SANDPIPERS;WINTERING POPULATION;NONBREEDING SEASON,,

Over the past two decades the number of resident individuals of the Ya Ha Tinda elk herd near Banff National Park has been increasing proportionally despite an overall population decline. We compared demographic rates of migrant and resident elk to test for demographic mechanisms partial migration. We determined adult female survival for 132 elk, pregnancy rates for 150 female elk, and elk calf survival for 79 calves. Population vital rates were combined in Leslie-matrix models to estimate demographic fitness, which we defined as the migration strategy-specific population growth rate. We also tested for differences in factors influencing risk of mortality between migratory strategies for adult females using Cox-proportional hazards regression and time-varying covariates of exposure to forage biomass, wolf predation risk, and group size. Despite higher pregnancy rates and winter calf weights associated with higher forage quality, survival of migrant adult females and calves were lower than resident elk. Resident elk traded high quality food to reduce predation risk by selecting areas close to human activity, and by living in group sizes 20% larger than migrants. Thus, residents experienced higher adult female survival and calf survival, but lower pregnancy and calf weights. Cause-specific mortality of migrants was dominated by wolf and grizzly bear mortality, whereas resident mortality was dominated by human hunting. Demographic differences translated into slightly higher (23%), but non-significant, resident population growth rate compared to migrant elk, suggesting demographic balancing between resident strategies during our study. Despite statistical equivalence, our results are also consistent with slow long-term declines in migrants because of high predation because of higher wolf-caused mortality in migrants. These results emphasize that migrants and residents will make different tradeoffs between forage and risk may affect the demographic balance of partially migratory populations, which may explain recent declines in migratory behavior in many ungulate populations around the world.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  92     Total Times Cited:  92     Cited Reference Count:  80 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/j.1600-0706.2011.19436.x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),MOOSE ALCES-ALCES;RED DEER POPULATIONS;BANFF-NATIONAL-PARK;CERVUS-ELAPHUS;RESOURCE SELECTION;DYNAMICS;STRATEGIES;EVOLUTION;SURVIVAL;BEHAVIOR;Prednisolone,,

To investigate the evolutionary basis of natal philopatry in a noncooperative species, the common goldeneye Bucephala clangula, we studied possible costs and benefits of simultaneous breeding of females and philopatric daughters. We did not find any fitness consequences of a daughter's breeding on their mother's breeding in terms of nest-site selection, body weight, clutch size, hatching date, or hatching success. Our results, therefore, did not support the assumption of the local resource competition hypothesis, that the natally philopatric sex should be more costly to a breeding parent. As possible benefits for daughters returning to their natal area, we tested inheritance of nest sites from mothers and explored whether daughters utilize the presence of their mother by parasitically sneaking into her mother's nest. Daughters' nest-site selection was not associated with the presence of their mothers. A comparison between daughters and control females revealed that daughters chose their nest site closer to their natal nest than expected by nest-site availability alone. Daughters could not expect to inherit a nest site from their mother, and we did not find other indications of cooperation between relatives either. The mother's clutch size did not increase in the year breeding with the daughter, indicating daughters do not parasitize their mother's nest. We suggest that benefits such as decreased nest predation risk associated with nesting close to the natal nest site may be important in the natal philopatric behavior of the species.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  21     Total Times Cited:  21     Cited Reference Count:  51 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1093/beheco/12.6.686     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Bucephala clangula;dispersal;kin competition;local resource competition;natal philopatry;LOCAL RESOURCE COMPETITION;SEX-RATIO VARIATION;BUCEPHALA-CLANGULA;NEST PARASITISM;DISPERSAL;BIRDS;HYPOTHESIS;POPULATION;EVOLUTION;MAMMALS;Bias (Epidemiology);Cost-Benefit Analysis,,

We examined the foraging and antipredator behaviour of rainbow darters, Etheostoma caeruleum, that were parasitized by glochidia larvae of freshwater mussels (Ptychobranchus occidentalis and Venustaconcha pleasii: Unionidae). Glochidia attach to the gills of the host and become encapsulated in host tissue. Over a period of days or weeks the larvae develop into free-living juveniles, which then leave the host. Parasitized darters increased ventilation rates (either early in the infestation or at the height of the infestation), were less active during foraging trials, lost more body size than nonparasitized darters and showed significantly weaker responses to predation risk (signalled by the presence of a chemical alarm cue). Therefore, even for a relatively short-term infection, parasitized darters may pay a cost in terms of decreased growth and decreased probability of survival.

However, the behavioural mechanisms behind the observed cases of coexistence and exclusion patterns between adult amphibians and fish are poorly understood. In the present study, we aimed at testing the hypothesis that adult newts display different feeding and space use behaviour in the presence of fish cues (i.e. access less food resources and use more shelters than when fish cues are absent). To achieve this we measured behavioural patterns in 100 adult Alpine newts (Mesotriton alpestris) in a replicated laboratory design (20 tanks x 7 replicates across time). Half of trials involved individuals in indirect (visual and olfactory) contact with goldfish (Carassius auratus), a non-predatory species for adult newts. In the presence of fish, significantly more newts hid under shelters than in their absence, but this difference decreased over time. A lower number of newts fed in comparison with controls. These results show that newts responded to fish presence even in the absence of direct contact, but the differences were small. Newts decreased vital activities such as exploration of open areas and feeding. They also adjusted shelter use over time, suggesting a process of habituation or a risk assessment in the absence of direct risk. These results reveal that exploring behavioural patterns can aid in understanding the causes of exclusion and coexistence patterns between fish and amphibians.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  28     Total Times Cited:  28     Cited Reference Count:  73 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/eth.12043     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),SENSITIVE PREDATOR-AVOIDANCE;CHEMICAL CUES;CARASSIUS-AURATUS;PREY INTERACTIONS;LARVAL NEWTS;TRADE-OFFS;WOOD FROG;RESPONSES;RISK;ANTIPREDATOR;Cues,,

This has not been confirmed in Mediterranean ecosystems. However, if feral dogs can predate upon wild Mediterranean ungulates, they can also do so upon livestock. Therefore, to more realistically understand human-wolf conflict in areas where wolves and feral dogs overlap, the possible role of the latter taking domestic prey should be considered. During a 6-month study period, we carried out daily observations of a pack of medium-sized dogs, where they were the only large-bodied carnivore capable of killing ungulates in a fenced estate in southern Spain. The estate contained sizeable populations of red deer, fallow deer and mouflons, but no livestock. We described feral dog predation patterns and depredatory impact. We found that dogs predated upon a total of 57 ungulates; fallow deer (47 %), red deer (37 %), and mouflon (16 %). Red deer adults were the least frequent prey, but dogs killed significantly more females and fawns of red and fallow deer. Mouflons were attacked indistinctly. Our results suggest that dogs in our study exhibited a kill pattern similar to Iberian wolves. Therefore, in areas where wolves and feral dogs coexist, a significant proportion of livestock predation could be falsely attributed to the wild canid. In addition, the presence of feral dogs may be a cause of risk in big game hunting estates.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  5     Total Times Cited:  6     Cited Reference Count:  51 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.25225/fozo.v65.i2.a8.2016     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),fallow deer;feral dogs;mouflon;red deer;wildlife damage;FOX VULPES-VULPES;CANIS-LUPUS;RED FOX;AVAILABILITY DATA;ATLANTIC FOREST;FOOD-HABITS;CONSERVATION;BEHAVIOR;POPULATIONS;COMPETITION;Humanities;Humanism;Humans;Dogs;Spain,,

Dynamics of any local population depends upon attributes of the local habitat. Although, use of refuge habitat by prey population can reduce their risk of predation, refuge use may also involve cost such as increased interspecific and intraspecific competition within the refuge patch. Surveys in the Sunderban mangrove ecosystem show that two detritivorous prey fishes Liza parsia and Liza tade coexist in nature by using refuges with the presence of the predator fish population Lates calcarifer. In view of such observations in mind, a three component model conceiving of two competing prey and one predator is considered in the present study with the inclusion of Holling type-II response function incorporating a fraction of prey refuge. The geographic position of these refuge patches tend to determine the population of prey residing in these patches which ultimately leads to the interspecific competition inclusion between prey. Here, we have differentiated the geographic position of the refuge patch into five different cases, for example, disjoint refuge patch (no competition between refuge prey population), partially overlapping refuge patch (competition between non-refuge and partially refuge prey population), only one prey refuge patch (competition between one prey population entirely and non-refuge prey population of the other) and common refuge patch (competition between both refuge and non-refuge prey in and out of the common patch). Equilibrium abundance of each population and the stability criterion are absolutely motivated by the interspecific competition strategies by both prey due to their patch selection. Mathematical results and numerical results support these hypothesis. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

We hypothesized that migratory pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) would experience greater survival compared to residents by moving longer distances to avoid severe winter weather and access higher quality forage. We used a Bayesian time-to-event approach to analyze the fates of 175 radio-collared adult female pronghorn monitored over 8 biological years (2004-2011) in the Northern Sagebrush Steppe ecosystem. Annual survivorship of migratory pronghorn was 7% higher on average compared to residents but not statistically different. Migratory pronghorn had higher survivorship in summer and winter compared to residents, and few mortalities were observed during the short autumn and spring migration periods. Mortality risk for both movement tactics intensified under more severe winter weather; winter weather severity alone best explained annual pronghorn mortality risk. The top model predicted survival rates to decline on average by 56% over the range of observed winter climatic conditions. To minimize human impacts to pronghorn during extreme climatic events, we recommend working with transportation departments and land managers to enhance pronghorn crossings of roads and railroads, and landholders to modify fences to wildlife-friendly standards.

Without Allee effect, the model has a unique globally asymptotically stable equilibrium point under some conditions. With Allee effect on prey, the model has none, one or two positive equilibria. Moreover, we prove the existence of parameter subsets for which the model can have Hopf bifurcation. And we find that when the model exhibits two positive equilibria there is a separatrix curve that separates the behavior of trajectories of the system, implying that the model is highly sensitive to the initial conditions. One of the most interesting findings is that Allee effect can increase the risk of ecological extinction. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Indirect effects, via interactions with targeted species, may also occur for species that are not themselves targeted by fishing. In some temperate rocky reef ecosystems, indirect effects have caused profound changes in community structure, notably the restoration of predator-urchin-macroalgae trophic cascades. Yet, indirect effects on small benthic reef fishes remain poorly understood, perhaps because of behavioral associations with complex, refuge-providing habitats. Few, if any, studies have evaluated any potential effects of marine reserves on habitat associations in small benthic fishes. We surveyed densities of small benthic fishes, including some endemic species of triplefin (Tripterygiidae), along with fine-scale habitat features in kelp forests on rocky reefs in and around multiple marine reserves in northern New Zealand over 3years. Bayesian generalized linear mixed models were used to evaluate evidence for (1) main effects of marine reserve protection, (2) associations with habitat gradients, including complexity, and (3) differences in habitat associations inside versus outside reserves. No evidence of overall main effects of marine reserves on species richness or densities of fishes was found. Both richness and densities showed strong associations with gradients in habitat features, particularly habitat complexity. In addition, some species exhibited reserve-by-habitat interactions, having different associations with habitat gradients inside versus outside marine reserves. Two species (Ruanoho whero and Forsterygion flavonigrum) showed stronger positive associations with habitat complexity inside reserves. These results are consistent with the presence of a behavioral risk effect, whereby prey fishes are more strongly attracted to habitats that provide refuge from predation in areas where predators are more abundant. This work highlights the importance of habitat structure and the potential for fishing to affect behavioral interactions and the interspecific dynamic attributes of community structure beyond simple predator-prey consumption and archetypal trophic cascades.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  4     Total Times Cited:  4     Cited Reference Count:  62 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1002/ece3.2406     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Bayesian hierarchical modeling;behavior;habitat association;indirect effects;multivariate generalized linear mixed models;no-take marine reserves;risk effects;small benthic fishes;temperate rocky reef;Tripterygiidae;MEDIATED INDIRECT INTERACTIONS;PREDATOR-PREY INTERACTIONS;NORTHEASTERN NEW-ZEALAND;SNAPPER PAGRUS-AURATUS;PROTECTED AREAS;REEF FISH;TROPHIC CASCADES;MIXED MODELS;KEY FEATURES;CORAL-REEFS;Military Personnel,,

These potentially negative effects become even more problematic when dealing with threatened or endangered species, such as the Mojave Desert tortoise (Copherus agassizii). We addressed three concerns regarding use of dogs trained to locate desert tortoises in the wild. First, we looked at the potential for dogs to attract native and non-native predators to sites at a greater rate than with human visitation alone by comparing presence of predator sign before and after visitation by dogs and by humans. We found no significant difference in predator sign based upon type of surveyor. Second, we looked at the difference in risk of predation to desert tortoises that were located in the wild by humans versus humans with wildlife-detector dogs. Over a 5-week period, during which tortoises were extensively monitored and a subsequent period of 1 year during which tortoises were monitored monthly, there was no predation on, nor sign of predator-inflicted trauma to tortoises initially encountered either by humans or wildlife-detector dogs. Third, we looked at movement patterns of tortoises after encounter by either humans or wildlife-detector dogs. Movement of desert tortoises was not significantly different after being found by a human versus being found by a wildlife-detector dog. Based upon these initial results we conclude that use of trained wildlife-detector dogs to survey for desert tortoises in the wild does not appear to increase attraction of predators, increase risk of predation, or alter movement patterns of desert tortoises more than surveys conducted by humans alone.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  6     Total Times Cited:  7     Cited Reference Count:  45 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1894/PAS-03.1     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),TORTOISE GOPHERUS-AGASSIZII;YELLOWSTONE-NATIONAL-PARK;CENTRAL MOJAVE DESERT;CANIS-FAMILIARIS;SCENT-MARKING;FERAL DOGS;COYOTE;PREDATION;LATRANS;RESPONSES;Humanities;Humanism;Humans;Dogs,,

We here demonstrate how common biologging data can be used to detect individual variation in behavioural predictability in the wild and reveal the coexistence of highly predictable individuals along with unpredictable individuals within the same population.        We repeatedly quantified two behaviours-daily movement distance and diurnal activity-in 62 female brown bears Ursus arctos tracked across 187 monitoring years. We calculated behavioural predictability over the short term (50 consecutive monitoring days within 1 year) and long term (across monitoring years) as the residual intra-individual variability (rIIV) of behaviour around the behavioural reaction norm. We tested whether predictability varies systematically across average behavioural types and whether it is correlated across functionally distinct behaviours, that is, daily movement distance and amount of diurnal activity.        Brown bears showed individual variation in behavioural predictability from predictable to unpredictable individuals. For example, the standard deviation around the average daily movement distance within one monitoring year varied up to fivefold from 1.1 to 5.5 km across individuals. Individual predictability for both daily movement distance and diurnality was conserved across monitoring years. Individual predictability was correlated with behavioural type where individuals which were on average more diurnal and mobile were also more unpredictable in their behaviour. In contrast, more nocturnal individuals moved less and were more predictable in their behaviour. Finally, individual predictability in daily movement distance and diurnality was positively correlated, suggesting that individual predictability may be a quantitative trait in its own regard that could evolve and is underpinned by genetic variation.        Unpredictable individuals may cope better with stochastic events and unpredictability may hence be an adaptive behavioural response to increased predation risk. Coexistence of predictable and unpredictable individuals may therefore ensure adaptable and resilient populations.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  11     Total Times Cited:  11     Cited Reference Count:  69 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/1365-2656.13406     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),animal personality;behavioural syndrome;double hierarchical model;movement;residual intra&#8208;individual variability;Ursus arctos;LONG-TERM;ANIMAL PERSONALITY;BROWN BEARS;PLASTICITY;EVOLUTIONARY;FLEXIBILITY;SPECIALISTS;PATTERNS;LIFE;REPEATABILITY,,

These exchanges can be particularly important in marginal habitats as they ensure the persistence of populations that are often most vulnerable to natural occurrences or anthropogenic activities. Medium-sized mammals can be particularly susceptible to changes in the landscape and their absence can be an indicator of habitat degradation. In this study, 6 pacas (Cuniculus paca), medium-sized mammals that are an important prey of large felids and a popular game species for hunters in Belize, were radiotracked in the Central Belize Corridor. Home range estimates for these were larger than those documented for pacas inhabiting broadleaf forests of Panama and Costa Rica. When broadleaf habitats were inaccessible due to flooding, pacas selected a savannah habitat with dense vegetation over more open grass savannahs. Knowledge of how pacas and other wildlife use the landscape in the wildlife corridor will allow more effective management by guiding the development of adequate regulations for hunting and resource exploitation.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  7     Total Times Cited:  7     Cited Reference Count:  54 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1093/jmammal/gyw179     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),corridor;home range;human-influenced;marginal habitat;prey species;telemetry;HOME-RANGE;SPACE-USE;DASYPROCTA-LEPORINA;POPULATION-DENSITY;SYMPATRIC JAGUARS;PREDATION RISK;MAMMALS;AGOUTI;PATTERNS;GRADIENT,,

We examined the distribution of a non-territorial apex carnivore relative to foraging habitat to assess the effect of two types of interference: competitive asymmetries in predatory ability and conspecific predation risk. Location Beaufort Sea, Canada. Methods The quality of foraging habitat was modelled using resource selection functions to relate the locations of seals killed by polar bears (Ursus maritimus) to attributes of the sea ice. We used estimated seal biomass as a sample weight to reflect the energetic return of different sizes of kills. To test the effect of sample weighting, locations at which polar bears were captured were used to compare habitat quality modelled with kills weighted equally and kills weighted by their biomass. The distributions of different demographic classes of polar bears were then compared with the general predictions of unequal-competitor models. Results Polar bear distribution was correlated with the quality of the foraging habitat as determined by the kill biomass model (r(s) = 0.90, P = 0.04), but not in the unweighted design (P = 0.75). No difference was detected in use of the highest-quality foraging habitat by subadults and adults. Females with cubs-of-the-year used lower-quality foraging habitat relative to the rest of the population. Main conclusions Weighting the habitat model with biologically relevant information improved its fit to species distribution, and suggested that density of use alone was insufficient to define habitat quality. Intraspecific competition had a varying influence on the distribution: unequal competitors coexisted, while the avoidance of conspecific predation risk resulted in semi-truncation.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  38     Total Times Cited:  38     Cited Reference Count:  66 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/geb.12112     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),resource selection;ideal free distribution;sample weight;polar bear;species distribution models;predator-prey;Conspecific predation;unequal competitors;SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS;IDEAL FREE DISTRIBUTION;BEARS URSUS-MARITIMUS;POLAR BEARS;PHOCA-HISPIDA;HABITAT SELECTION;BREEDING HABITAT;RINGED SEAL;PREDATORS;BEHAVIOR,,

In order for responses to stressors to be correctly interpreted, it is critical that measurements are taken on wild animals using minimally invasive techniques. Studies investigating wild animal responses to stressors often measure either a single physiological or behavioural variable, but whether such responses are comparable and concordant remains uncertain. We investigated this question in a pilot study that measured responses of wild-caught urban brown and black rats (Rattus norvegicus, Rattus rattus) to fur-based olfactory cues from a predator, the domestic cat (Felis catus); a novel herbivore, the koala (Phascolarctos cinereus); and a familiar herbivore and competitor, the common brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula). Physiological responses, measured by assaying faecal glucocorticoid metabolites, were compared to behavioural responses observed via video recordings. We found that physiological and behavioural responses to stressors were expressed concordantly. There was no sizeable physiological response observed, and the behavioural response when considered across the night was negligible. However, the behavioural response to the predator and competitor cues changed across the observation period, with activity increasing with increasing hours of exposure. Our results indicate that responses of wild rodents to cues are nuanced, with stress responses modulated by behaviour changes that vary over time according to the severity of the perceived threat as animals gather further information. If the physiological response alone had been assessed, this moderated response may not have been evident, and in terms of wildlife management, vital information would have been lost.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  3     Total Times Cited:  3     Cited Reference Count:  111 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s00114-020-01716-8     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Stress response;Predator avoidance;Corticosterone;Faecal glucocorticoid;Non-invasive monitoring;Wildlife;PREDATION RISK;ADRENOCORTICAL ACTIVITY;ANTIPREDATOR BEHAVIOR;FERAL CATS;SHIP RATS;CORTICOSTERONE;CONSERVATION;THREAT;BLOOD;FEAR;Rodentia,,

Current actions to reduce it are far from effective and fail to prevent population declines of many endangered species, pressing the need for innovative anti-poaching solutions. Here, we propose and test a poacher early warning system that is based on the movement responses of non-targeted sentinel animals, which naturally respond to threats by fleeing and changing herd topology. We analyzed human-evasive movement patterns of 135 mammalian savanna herbivores of four different species, using an internet-of-things architecture with wearable sensors, wireless data transmission and machine learning algorithms. We show that the presence of human intruders can be accurately detected (86.1% accuracy) and localized (less than 500 m error in 54.2% of the experimentally staged intrusions) by algorithmically identifying characteristic changes in sentinel movement. These behavioral signatures include, among others, an increase in movement speed, energy expenditure, body acceleration, directional persistence and herd coherence, and a decrease in suitability of selected habitat. The key to successful identification of these signatures lies in identifying systematic deviations from normal behavior under similar conditions, such as season, time of day and habitat. We also show that the indirect costs of predation are not limited to vigilance, but also include (1) long, high-speed flights; (2) energetically costly flight paths; and (3) suboptimal habitat selection during flights. The combination of wireless biologging, predictive analytics and sentinel animal behavior can benefit wildlife conservation via early poacher detection, but also solve challenges related to surveillance, safety and health.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  49 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1038/s41598-021-83800-1     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),ENERGY LANDSCAPES;DISTURBANCE;RESPONSES;HUMANS;FEAR;Animal Shells;Animals;Movement,,

Remarkably, for diverse animal species, including humans, spontaneous patterns of waiting times show random 'burstiness' that appears scale-invariant across a broad set of scales. However, a general theory linking this phenomenon across the animal kingdom currently lacks an ecological basis. Here, we demonstrate from tracking the activities of 15 sympatric predator species (cephalopods, sharks, skates and teleosts) under natural and controlled conditions that bursty waiting times are an intrinsic spontaneous behaviour well approximated by heavy-tailed (power-law) models over data ranges up to four orders of magnitude. Scaling exponents quantifying ratios of frequent short to rare very long waits are species-specific, being determined by traits such as foragingmode (active versus ambush predation), body size and prey preference. A stochastic-deterministic decision model reproduced the empirical waiting time scaling and species-specific exponents, indicating that apparently complex scaling can emerge from simple decisions. Results indicate temporal power-law scaling is a behavioural 'rule of thumb' that is tuned to species' ecological traits, implying a common pattern may have naturally evolved that optimizes move-wait decisions in less predictable natural environments.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  30     Total Times Cited:  30     Cited Reference Count:  44 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1098/rspb.2013.2997     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),movement ecology;foraging strategy;search;random walk;intermittence;human dynamics;LEVY WALKS EVOLVE;SEARCH PATTERNS;MOVEMENT;DYNAMICS;FLIGHT;SUCCESS;BODY;Prednisolone,,

Bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) are polygynous ungulates that exhibit extreme sexual dimorphism and segregate into ram and ewe herds outside of the rutting season. Four major hypotheses for sexual segregation were tested in a population of desert bighorn (O. c. mexicana) at the Red Rock Wildlife Area, New Mexico, from 1999-2001. We collected data on the size, composition, and location of ram and ewe groups during the summer period of segregation. Activity budgets were recorded for males in ram herds and females in ewe herds, and foraging selectivity was measured for males and females in mixed groups during early rut. Habitat was evaluated by measuring forage availability, ruggedness, and visibility at sites utilized by ram and ewe groups. Ram herds utilized areas with more available forage compared with ewe sites, while ewe groups preferred more rugged terrain than that used by ram groups. Ewe groups occurred much closer to free water sources than did ram groups. Bighorns in ram and ewe groups did not differ in foraging time or selectivity, nor did time spent moving, reclining, or ruminating differ between the sexes as predicted by the 'activity budget hypothesis'. The results support the predictions of the 'reproductive strategy-predation risk hypothesis', which proposes that males seek more abundant forage in order to build up body condition needed to maximize mating success (even if exposing themselves to greater predation risk), while females choose rugged terrain that minimizes predation risk to themselves and their offspring (even if sacrificing forage abundance). Female bighorns chose sites that provided access to water, also predicted by the 'reproductive strategy-predation risk hypothesis', indicating that lactation-related water requirements may constrain the movements of ewe groups and contribute to patterns of sexual segregation in desert bighorn.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  70     Total Times Cited:  72     Cited Reference Count:  56 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1163/156853903321671497     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),MOUNTAIN LION PREDATION;SIZE DIMORPHISM;BODY-SIZE;HABITAT;CALIFORNIA;PATTERNS;RUMINANTS;SELECTION;BEHAVIOR;QUALITY;Sheep,,

Group-foraging nutmeg mannikins engaged in a producer-scrounger game search for their own food (play producer) by hopping with the head down and search for others' food discoveries (play scrounger) by hopping with the head up. If the scrounger tactic is compatible with antipredatory vigilance, then an increase in antipredatory vigilance should lead to the detection of more joining opportunities, and hence to more joining by foragers. We tested this prediction as well as the extent to which stationary birds use head up exclusively for antipredatory purposes and hopping birds use head up for foraging purposes only. We observed three flocks of nutmeg mannikins searching for hidden clumps of food in an indoor aviary. We used a 2 x 2 factorial design in which both the distance to a safe refuge and the food distribution were manipulated. The use of head up by stationary and eating birds increased significantly with increased distance to cover. Distance to cover, however, had no effect on the use of the scrounger tactic or on the level of joining. We found no evidence of compatibility between the scrounger tactic and antipredatory vigilance.

Consequently, the organism's reproductive value is an important component of most antipredator decision problems. In this paper reproductive value is considered as an asset in need of protection. The ''asset-protection principle'' states that the larger the current reproductive asset, the more important it becomes to protect it. Because reproductive value is usually age and condition dependent, optimal antipredator behavior also often depends on these variables. I use a uniform modeling technique (dynamic programming) to address a variety of issues related to antipredator behavior.

By fusing simulated and real animal behavior, we isolated predator effects while controlling for confounding factors. Prey with a tendency to be attracted toward, and to align direction of travel with, near neighbors tended to form mobile coordinated groups and were rarely attacked.

State-space modeling is useful for analysing movement trajectories, particularly with hidden Markov models (HMM). Yet importantly, the ontogeny of underlying (unobservable) behavioural states revealed by the HMMs has rarely been verified in the field. Methods Using hidden Markov models of individual movement from animal location, biotelemetry, and environmental data, we explored multistate behaviour and the effect of associated intrinsic and extrinsic drivers across life stages. We also decomposed the activity budgets of different movement states at two general and caching phases. The latter - defined as the period following a kill which likely involves the caching of uneaten prey - was subsequently confirmed by field inspections. We applied this method to GPS relocation data of a caching predator, Persian leopard Panthera pardus saxicolor in northeastern Iran. Results Multistate modeling provided strong evidence for an effect of life stage on the behavioural states and their associated time budget. Although environmental covariates (ambient temperature and diel period) and ecological outcomes (predation) affected behavioural states in non-resident leopards, the response in resident leopards was not clear, except that temporal patterns were consistent with a crepuscular and nocturnal movement pattern. Resident leopards adopt an energetically more costly mobile behaviour for most of their time while non-residents shift their behavioural states from high energetic expenditure states to energetically less costly encamped behaviour for most of their time, which is likely to be a risk avoidance strategy against conspecifics or humans. Conclusions This study demonstrates that plasticity in predator behaviour depending on life stage may tackle a trade-off between successful predation and avoiding the risks associated with conspecifics, human presence and maintaining home range. Range residency in territorial predators is energetically demanding and can outweigh the predator's response to intrinsic and extrinsic variables such as thermoregulation or foraging needs. Our approach provides an insight into spatial behavior and decision making of leopards, and other large felids in rugged landscapes through the application of the HMMs in movement ecology.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  6     Total Times Cited:  6     Cited Reference Count:  49 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1186/s40462-020-0195-z     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Caching behaviour;Hidden Markov models;Life-stage;Multistate animal movement;Panthera pardus saxicolor;Range residency;Satellite telemetry;Viterbi algorithm;PERSIAN LEOPARD;MOVEMENT MODELS;ANIMAL MOVEMENT;BEHAVIOR;PATTERNS;TEMPERATURE;SIZE;Decision Making;Prednisolone,,

Consequently, kokanee populations are almost universally sampled during the dark phase of the moon (i.e., the new moon), presumably to optimize capture efficiency. However, it is unclear if this sampling precaution is necessary to avoid bias in kokanee catch data related to the moon phase. We used experimental gill nets to sample kokanee populations in two thermally stratified reservoirs during three distinct moon phases (i.e., new, first quarter, and full) to understand the relative effects of moon phase and other ambient light variables on total catch and average size of captured kokanee. The total catch of kokanee differed significantly between populations but was not significantly affected by moon phase, secchi depth, or net depth. The average size of kokanee sampled from both populations increased significantly with moon illuminance and likely reflects behavior associated with predatorprey dynamics. Results from this case study suggest that the effect of moon phase and other ambient light variables on gill-net catch composition of kokanee is likely population-specific and is governed in part by population parameters such as abundance, growth rate, and size-structure. As such, investigators should be cognizant of-or perhaps standardize gill-net samples to-ambient light variables when indexing populations of kokanee and other pelagic fishes that undertake diel vertical migrations, especially when size indices are examined.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  28 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1002/nafm.10765     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),DIEL VERTICAL MIGRATION;JUVENILE SOCKEYE-SALMON;PREY CONSUMPTION;FORAGING MODEL;LAKE;ZOOPLANKTON;BEHAVIOR;GROWTH;RESERVOIRS;TURBIDITY;Moon,,

Large carnivores are subject to harvest around the world; however, few studies examine whether habitat use is different between harvested and unharvested carnivore populations. We examined the effects of harvest on gray wolf (Canis lupus) use of pup-rearing habitat. We predicted that in comparison to an unharvested population of wolves, wolves subject to harvest would use less suitable pup-rearing habitat (i.e., sites with no standing water source and dense vegetation with no open areas) and locate pup-rearing sites in areas with lower human activity. We also predicted that wolves would use less suitable pup-rearing habitat following breeder turnover. Finally, we predicted that field surveys using a method for monitoring an unharvested wolf population would detect fewer active pup-rearing sites and document fewer detections of scat, tracks, and howls of a harvested wolf population. We tested whether a habitat model for predicting pup-rearing sites used by an unharvested wolf population accurately predicted sites used by a harvested wolf population. To examine the effect of human activity, we calculated the road density within a 500-m buffer around sites used by an unharvested and harvested population of wolves. We also evaluated the habitat suitability of pup-rearing sites following the death of a breeder. Finally, we conducted field surveys of a harvested wolf population with a monitoring technique used for unharvested wolf populations, and compared detections of pup-rearing sites, scats, tracks, and howls between the unharvested and harvested wolf populations. Harvest did not affect wolf use of pup-rearing habitat. Wolves subject to harvest used highly suitable habitat (i.e., areas with standing, ephemeral water) to raise pups, road density near pup-rearing sites did not differ between harvested and unharvested wolf populations, and breeder turnover did not result in packs choosing less suitable pup-rearing habitat. Finally, field surveys successfully detected pup-rearing sites of wolves subject to harvest but documented fewer detections of scats and tracks, likely because of a decrease in wolf density. Wolves subject to harvest chose highly suitable habitat to raise pups, indicating that such habitat provides optimal resources in a landscape where harvest is a dominant source of mortality. In areas where such habitat is limited, it is important to consider how environmental changes affect the availability of suitable habitat.

This might stem from the octopus' ability to respond to influences such as predation pressure by adjusting its activity pattern. To test the hypothesis that a predatory threat could alter activity cycles, six octopuses were each held in a partitioned tank with a potential predator for a week. After we had determined the circadian activity of each undisturbed subject for two days, a nocturnal (moray eel, Muraena helena) and a diurnal fish (triggerfish, Balistes carolinensis) were alternately introduced into the second compartment of the tank for seven days. Each of these periods was then followed by a four-day period without eel or triggerfish. During the experiment, subjects had visual and chemical access but no physical contact. Octopuses showed an increase in activity in the presence of both species, but this increase was only significantly negatively correlated with the activity of the triggerfish. Attacks on the barrier by the octopus and the triggerfish decreased throughout the week, but this was not true for the octopus and the moray eel. We concluded that O. vulgaris can use temporal spacing of activity to respond to potential predators. This ability might be responsible for conflicting reports of activity patterns of O. vulgaris.

A combined RSF model therefore may be used to predict the relative probability of resource selection by Dall's sheep in WRST regardless of sex or reproductive status.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  5     Total Times Cited:  6     Cited Reference Count:  90 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1093/jmammal/gyw135     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),alpine ungulate;Dall's sheep;habitat selection;Ovis;reproductive status;resource selection function;sexual segregation;PREDATION-RISK-FACTORS;SEXUAL SEGREGATION;RESOURCE SELECTION;BIGHORN SHEEP;OVIS-DALLI;POPULATION-DENSITY;FORAGING BEHAVIOR;ALPINE UNGULATE;TAILED DEER;SOAY SHEEP;Sheep;Alaska;Ecosystem,,

The influence of tidal currents and water turbidity on individual movement behavior were investigated during the spawning migration of the threatened delta smelt, Hypomesus transpacificus, in the northern San Francisco Estuary, California, USA. Water current velocities and turbidity levels were measured concurrently with delta smelt occurrence at sites in the lower Sacramento River and San Joaquin River as turbidity increased due to first-flush winter rainstorms in January and December 2010. The presence/absence of fish at the shoal-channel interface and near the shoreline was quantified hourly over complete tidal cycles. Delta smelt were caught consistently at the shoal-channel interface during flood tides and near the shoreline during ebb tides in the turbid Sacramento River, but were rare in the clearer San Joaquin River. The apparent selective tidal movements by delta smelt would facilitate either maintaining position or moving upriver on flood tides, and minimizing advection down-estuary on ebb tides. These movements also may reflect responses to lateral gradients in water turbidity created by temporal lags in tidal velocities between the near-shore and mid-channel habitats. This migration strategy can minimize the energy spent swimming against strong river and tidal currents, as well as predation risks by remaining in turbid water. Selection pressure on individuals to remain in turbid water may underlie population-level observations suggesting that turbidity is a key habitat feature and cue initiating the delta smelt spawning migration.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  23     Total Times Cited:  23     Cited Reference Count:  45 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s12237-014-9877-3     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Selective tidal movements;Tidal currents;Turbidity;Migration;Endangered species;San Francisco Estuary;LOW-SALINITY ZONE;LIFE-HISTORY;SOCKEYE-SALMON;STREAM TRANSPORT;ATLANTIC SALMON;FISH;CALIFORNIA;EVOLUTION;COSTS;POPULATIONS,,

We used nest survival data for the Dusky Flycatcher Empidonax oberholseri to examine several factors that may influence nesting success. Our prediction was that the number of nest initiations would be positively associated with period nest survival. We used a model selection framework and found that nesting success was a function of clutch size and a cubic effect of age. Clutches with one, two, three, and four eggs had period survival rates of 0, 0.05, 0.33, and 0.49, respectively. Daily survival rates decreased from the onset of egg-laying and increased during the later stages of incubation before remaining relatively constant through the later portions of the nestling stage. Model-selection criterion provided support for a date effect on daily survival (i.e., daily nest survival declined across the nesting season) although the 95% confidence interval for the estimate included zero. We found that the majority of nest initiations occurred early in the nest season and declined across the season as period nest survival declined. Our prediction concerning nest survival was partially supported. In addition, we found substantial positive associations between clutch size and nest survival. While low daily survival rates for clutches with one or two eggs suggested that individuals may have reduced reproductive effort in response to nest predation risk, we did not find strong evidence that individuals reduced their clutch sizes in subsequent nest attempts. Alternative predictions, including the preferential settlement of higher quality individuals (e.g., those with the ability to lay full clutches to replace depredated nests) into high-quality habitat and differences in behavior patterns (e.g., number of visits to provision nestlings), may provide more consistent explanations for these patterns.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  9     Total Times Cited:  9     Cited Reference Count:  71 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s10336-008-0353-3     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Clutch size;Dusky Flycatcher;Nest success;Nest survival;Temporal variation;THROATED BLUE WARBLERS;HABITAT SELECTION;PREDATION RISK;REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS;SEASONAL DECLINE;SITE SELECTION;LIFE-HISTORY;TERRITORY SIZE;SONG SPARROWS;FOOD,,

In this study, we equipped 25 dominant Eurasian beavers (Castor fiber) with GPS units to study spatial movement patterns both on land and in water in relation to territory size, resource availability, the number of neighbours, season, and the beavers' age. We show a territory size dependent trade-off between territorial behaviours and foraging distances: Beavers in larger territories moved greater distances each night, thereby spending more time patrolling, and stayed closer to the shoreline when being on land (i.e. when foraging). Inversely, in smaller territories beavers patrolled less and foraged further away from the shoreline. These results suggest that individuals trade-off the costs of patrolling larger territories against the benefits of foraging closer towards the shoreline. Smaller territories might be more prone to resource depletion, thus, making foraging further from the shoreline a strategy to ensure sustainable resource use. Further, older beavers spent more time on land and close to territory borders compared to younger ones, suggesting a behavioural change with age possibly due to increased experience and boldness.

We collected information on seals killed by polar bears (n = 650) and hunting attempts on ringed seal (Pusa hispida) lairs (n = 1396) observed from a helicopter during polar bear mark-recapture studies in the eastern Beaufort Sea in spring in 1985-2011. We investigated how temporal shifts in ringed seal reproduction affect kill composition and the intraspecific vulnerabilities of ringed seals to polar bear predation.        Principal Findings: Polar bears primarily preyed on ringed seals (90.2%) while bearded seals (Erignathus barbatus) only comprised 9.8% of the kills, but 33% of the biomass. Adults comprised 43.6% (150/344) of the ringed seals killed, while their pups comprised 38.4% (132/344). Juvenile ringed seals were killed at the lowest proportion, comprising 18.0% (62/344) of the ringed seal kills. The proportion of ringed seal pups was highest between 2007-2011, in association with high ringed seal productivity. Half of the adult ringed seal kills were >= 21 years (60/121), and kill rates of adults increased following the peak of parturition. Determination of sex from DNA revealed that polar bears killed adult male and adult female ringed seals equally (0.50, n = 78). The number of hunting attempts at ringed seal subnivean lair sites was positively correlated with the number of pup kills (r(2) = 0.30, P = 0.04), but was not correlated with the number of adult kills (P = 0.37).        Conclusions/Significance: Results are consistent with decadal trends in ringed seal productivity, with low numbers of pups killed by polar bears in spring in years of low pup productivity, and conversely when pup productivity was high. Vulnerability of adult ringed seals to predation increased in relation to reproductive activities and age, but not gender.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  38     Total Times Cited:  39     Cited Reference Count:  63 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1371/journal.pone.0041429     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),PHOCA-HISPIDA PUPS;RINGED SEAL;URSUS-MARITIMUS;BREEDING HABITAT;PREDATION RISK;HUDSON-BAY;SERUM UREA;BEHAVIOR;ECOLOGY;SVALBARD,,

Whether it is generally most advantageous to defend early or late during such encounters is an open theoretical question. We model conditions under which a prey species might evolve early or late defenses in response to predation. Adapting a two-prey, one-predator Rosenzweig-MacArthur system of differential equations, we analyze the effects of modified antipredator defenses (and their associated costs) on the ability of a new prey type to invade the one-prey, one-predator limiting system at equilibrium. We show that the outcome, in terms of invasion potential, is crucially dependent on the ratio of the prey's proportional population growth rate to the cost of predator encounters.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  23     Total Times Cited:  24     Cited Reference Count:  34 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1086/675903     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),defense timing;invasion analysis;predator-prey model;cost/benefit ratio;predation sequence;predation cycle;INDUCIBLE DEFENSES;PREY MODEL;FITNESS CONSEQUENCES;TRAIT COMPENSATION;LIFE-HISTORY;BEHAVIOR;SYSTEMS;RISK;PLASTICITY;AVOIDANCE;Prednisolone,,

For mathematical simplicity, theories of anti-predator vigilance have generally assumed that animals initiate scans with a constant probability for each unit of time spent feeding. Initiating scans in such a fashion would produce a wide distribution of intervals between scans. Because so much variation was assumed by theory, observations of variation have received little consideration. We show that the original theories of vigilance contain a conceptual discrepancy between the assumed predator and anti-predator tactics. Modified versions of the theory allow variation only under restrictive circumstances that seem unlikely to apply in nature. Plausible reasons for the observed variation in interscan interval are that theories of vigilance assume the wrong predator tactics or the wrong details of predator detection. These possibilities lead to testable predictions about how distributions of interscan intervals should change under different threat and detection conditions.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  52     Total Times Cited:  53     Cited Reference Count:  31 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1034/j.1600-048X.2002.330204.x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),GROUP-SIZE;ACCIPITER-NISUS;RISK;PREDATION;BEHAVIOR;CHAOS;RANDOMNESS;SEQUENCES;TIME;Prednisolone,,

They have to provide very strong advantages to have been selected and generalized in the course of evolution. Auto-organized groups are usually assumed to provide facilitated encounters of reproduction partners, improved protection against predation, better foraging efficiency, and hydrodynamic gains. However, present theories regarding their evolutionary advantages do not provide an unambiguous explanation to their universality. In particular, the mechanisms commonly proposed to explain grouping provide little support to the formation of very large groups that are common in the sea (e.g. Rieucau et al., 2014). From literature review, data analysis and using a simple mathematical model, I show that large auto-organized groups appear at high population density while only small groups or dispersed individuals remain at low population density. Following, an analysis of tuna tagging data and simple theoretical developments show that large groups are likely to expose individuals to a dramatic decrease of individual foraging success and simultaneous increase of predatory and disease mortality, while small groups avoid those adverse feedbacks and provide maximum foraging success and protection against predation, as it is usually assumed. This would create an emergent density-dependent regulation of marine populations, preventing them from outbursts at high density, and protecting them at low density. This would be a major contribution to their resilience and a crucial process of ecosystems dynamics. A two-step evolutionary process acting at the individual level is proposed to explain how this apparently suicidal behaviour could have been selected and generalized. It explains how grouping would have permitted the emergence of extremely high fecundity life histories, despite their notorious propensity to destabilize populations. The potential implications of the ""grouping feedback"" on population resilience, ecosystem stability and the persistence of marine biodiversity are discussed. The risk of harvesting marine species with fishing gears that enable catching dispersed individuals (such as longline, gillnet, trawl or using fishing aggregative devices for instance) is underlined. Finally, tropical tunas are used to exemplify the potential importance of schooling in shaping complex life histories and species interaction. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

While ectothermic top predators may compensate by increasing foraging, ectothermic prey may be unable to increase foraging because of increased predation risk from ectothermic predators. We examined how the diurnal drift behavior (i.e., the downstream movement associated with foraging) of the mayfly Baetis, an ectothermic herbivore, responds to changing temperature in the implied presence and absence of trout, an ectothermic predator. In an experiment replicated at the catchment scale, water temperature and trout presence strongly interacted to affect the diurnal drift of Baetis from artificial channels lacking periphyton over a water temperature range of 4.2-14.8 A degrees C. In fishless streams, daytime drift increased with increasing water temperature, likely because of increased metabolic demand for food. However, in trout-bearing streams, daytime drift decreased with increasing water temperature. Our interpretation is that the perceived threat of trout rose with increasing water temperature, causing mayflies to reduce foraging despite heightened metabolic demand. These results suggest that anticipated increases in stream temperature due to climate change may further escalate divergence in structure and process between fishless and trout-bearing streams. Similar dynamics may occur in other ecosystems with ectothermic predators and prey living below their thermal optima.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  5     Total Times Cited:  5     Cited Reference Count:  38 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s00442-014-2955-1     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Invertebrate drift;Metabolic demand;Baetidae;Climate change;Invasive species;Foraging;STREAM;FISH;PREDATION;DRIFT;PERIODICITY;ECOLOGY;GROWTH;Temperature;Trout,,

The H&J mating theory and SPT predict adaptive behavior of individuals accepting and rejecting potential mates without recourse to scenarios for the evolution of sex differences via anisogamy or parental investment. Sex-neutral models begin with individuals, not sexes. Null models assume no pre-existing sex-specific adaptations. H&J's mating theory and the SPT are discrete time absorbing Markov models that count the times individuals enter states such as receptivity, mating, latency to onset to receptivity, and death. H&J's model and the SPT are analytical solutions for the variance in mating success and the variance in reproductive success, as well as for the fraction of potential mates that are acceptable as mates to a given individual when potential mates differ in the fitness that they would confer to a given mating partner. In H&J's model, there are only two qualities of mates; in the SPT, there are n qualities of mates, where n = the number of potential mates in the population. Thus, both models predict mating failures and multiple mating for both sexes under similar or different demographic circumstances, including the fitness background (the fitness distribution of the pool of potential mates) under which individuals make reproductive decisions. In addition, we conducted numerical experiments using DYNAMATE (c), a dynamic, agent-based (object-oriented) simulation program that tracks dynamically the fate and interactions of all individuals in a single population over a reproductive season. DYNAMATE embodies the analytical solutions of the SPT as rules that determine individually adaptive reproductive decisions. With DYNAMATE we studied how moment-to-moment changes in demographic circumstances change individual behavior and trajectories of mating opportunities under the rules of the SPT that determined for each individual each of its adaptive (fitness enhancing) reproductive decisions. The models demonstrate that the pathways to life-long virginity and multiple mating reside in: (1) variation in individual lifespan; (2) variation in encounters with potential mates; (3) adaptive acceptance or rejection of potential mates as actual mates, which in the case of rejection of all encountered potential mates, results in life-long virginity, a fitness trap; (4) opposite-sex acceptances or rejections of potential mates as mates; and/or (5) some combination of (1)(4). The models make quantitative predictions about life-long failures to mate. Results are consistent with the conclusions that the paradoxical twin riddles of females failing to mate or mating multiply can occur without any appeal to or requirement for pre-existing fixed sex differences in choosy or indiscriminate behavior. It may be that the twin riddles of polyandry and female mating failures are only puzzling because the assumptions from parental investment and anisogamy theories about the fixed nature of female mating behavior are wrong.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  11     Total Times Cited:  11     Cited Reference Count:  77 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/eea.12023     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),multiple inseminations;cost of reproduction;demographic stochasticity;mating theory;switch point theorem;sexual conflict;OPERATIONAL SEX-RATIO;FEMALE MATE CHOICE;DECREASE OFFSPRING VIABILITY;PREDATION RISK;REPRODUCTIVE ASYNCHRONY;SELECTION;PREFERENCES;PARASITES;CONSTRAINTS;SUCCESS,,

In species with complex life cycles, such as pond-breeding amphibians, the selection of a suitable wetland is crucial. While the traditional view of amphibian ecology suggests strong site fidelity and low vagility, more recent research highlights mechanisms involving active site choice through avoidance behaviour and bet-hedging strategies in heterogeneous environments. The introduction of fish to the aquatic environment is one of the factors that may alter site selection and lead to local dispersal. In this context, we investigated the habitat choice of Alpine newts, Ichthyosaura alpestris, in networks of fish (Carassius auratus) and fishless aquatic patches. Using a laboratory design consisting of aquaria divided into two water tanks connected by a terrestrial platform, we assessed newt distribution and movement between patches. During the breeding period, we compared the reproductive success of individuals in two types of networks. We found that newts escaped fish by rapidly changing aquatic patches and then aggregating in safe aquatic patches that were free of fish. In the fish network, newts maintained reproduction, but the high local abundance resulted in decreased sexual activity and egg production and increased use of the terrestrial habitat. However, in the fishless network, newts moved between aquatic patches several times, exhibited more courtship behaviour and laid more eggs than they did in the fish networks. Our results showed both adaptive habitat switching due to environmental risks in the fish network and habitat supplementation (i.e. use of alternative resources) in the fishless network. Such studies on movement behaviour and habitat selection have conservation implications in showing that the persistence of native species in invaded networks depends on the rescue effect, with immigration to fish-free habitats potentially preventing local extinction.

Oncorhynchus mykiss tend to drift-forage in higher velocity habitat than other salmonids, yet their presence in streams with seasonally low velocity and drift suggests behavioral flexibility. We combined 3D videogrammetry with measurements of invertebrate drift and stream hydraulics to investigate the drivers of O. mykiss foraging mode and movement during the seasonal recession in a California stream. From May to July (2016), foraging movement rate increased as prey concentration and velocity declined; however, movement decreased in August as pools became low and still. In May, 80% of O. mykiss were drift-foraging, while by July, over 70% used search or benthic-foraging modes. Velocity and riffle crest depth were significant predictors of foraging mode, while drift concentration was a poor univariate predictor. However, top-ranked additive models included both hydraulic variables and drift concentration. A drift-foraging bioenergetic model was a poor predictor of foraging mode. We suggest that infall and benthic prey, as well as risk aversion, may influence late-summer foraging decisions.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  2     Total Times Cited:  2     Cited Reference Count:  78 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1139/cjfas-2020-0398     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),TROUT SALVELINUS-FONTINALIS;LENGTH-MASS RELATIONSHIPS;JUVENILE COHO SALMON;RAINBOW-TROUT;STEELHEAD TROUT;TERRESTRIAL INVERTEBRATES;FEEDING SALMONIDS;PREDATION RISK;BROWN TROUT;GROWTH-RATE;California,,

Movements of individuals in response to hunting disturbance may expose geese to reduced feeding opportunities and higher predation risks, which can have consequences on the population level. Thus geese should use habitats that provide access to food and minimize encounters with hunters. Our study focused on differences in the proportion of hunting-free area used and in the total area used by individuals, size of water bodies used by birds, and flight distance between roosting and feeding areas, during two periods before and after the start of the hunting season. In south Bohemia (Czech Republic), in 2012, 2014 and 2015, we attached seventeen GPS/GSM-transmitters to moulting Greylag Geese Anser anser. We analysed data from nine transmitters, recording two or twelve logs per day, using minimum convex polygons home range estimates and Wilcoxon matched pairs test. We showed that shortly after the opening of the hunting season, individual Greylag Geese used a significantly larger area and increased their roosting-feeding flight distances. These changes in local movements are likely linked with the start of hunting activity which relates to increased human disturbance in the study area. In the post-breeding season, this may broadly affect the birds' energetic costs and ability to accumulate sufficient reserves for the upcoming autumn migration. However, we did not find a significant difference in the proportion of hunting-free (protected) areas used during our study periods. This result, together with the observed decrease in numbers of Greylag Geese in south Bohemia in the second half of August, may be evidence of a lack of larger disturbance-free refuges in the study area.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  3     Total Times Cited:  3     Cited Reference Count:  25 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.5253/arde.v104i1.a5     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),geese;hunting disturbance;GPS/GSM-transmitters;Minimum Convex Polygons (MCP);KERNEL METHODS;DISTURBANCE;Seasons,,

Sepioteuthis sepioidea, observed by snorkellers near the shore in early morning/late afternoon, produced an average of eight moves of over 1 m per hour, apparently mostly antipredator behaviours. Close approaches by herbivorous parrotfish elicited no response in 74% of encounters; otherwise, squid produced agonistic zebra stripes or startle-mantle-dots skin patterns. Predatory bar jack fish caused flight but not zebra displays, and squid usually paled and fled quickly (66%) from snapper. The speed of approach was the best predictor for flight and display responses to snapper, but for bar jack and parrotfish, the relative fish size and distance were the predictors for escalated responses. Paired dorsolateral mantle dots were produced when squid approached the sea bottom or hunted outside the group and in reaction to fish approaches; 56% of these were to the very common parrotfish. Reactive pairs of spots were selected from four possible mantle locations and they were significantly likely to be directional towards fish, presumably as startle/warning, but not directed towards conspecifics as indicators of predator presence. Thus the evasion techniques of the cephalopods and their ability to produce different display patterns on the skin show how an intelligent animal modifies an otherwise simple decision about which pairs of spots to select from four possible mantle locations and whether to flee from potentially dangerous animals.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  15     Total Times Cited:  15     Cited Reference Count:  51 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1080/10236244.2010.526760     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),squid;Sepioteuthis sepioidea;behaviour;vigilance;antipredator responses;SEPIOTEUTHIS-SEPIOIDEA;PREDATION RISK;BODY PATTERNS;CUTTLEFISH;BEHAVIOR;AVOIDANCE;CRYPSIS;Caribbean Region,,

Receptive individuals readily formed pairs in the laboratory and the latency to formation of precopulatory pairs was decreased under threat of predation. In addition, females and,under conditions of extreme danger, males that formed pairs were significantly smaller when under the threat of predation. Amphipods distinguished between chemical stimuli (aquarium water) from predatory and nonpredatory fishes and between chemical cues from fish predators (trout) that had recently eaten conspecific amphipods vs. those fed a control diet of pelleted commercial fish food. These data indicate that chemical stimuli associated with predators can influence reproductive behavior of amphipods. The results also suggest the hypotheses that: 1. search time may be costly in terms of probability of predation; and 2. small pairs may be safer from predation than larger pairs.

Biol.,32,3,585-592,"HOLOMUZKI, JR and HATCHETT, LA",,English,,,"1.  We examined whether long-term exposure to chemical cues of predatory longear sunfish (Lepomis megalottis) affected growth and rates of leaf processing by the isopod, Lirceus fontinalis, an important facultative shredder in low-order streams in the eastern United States, and whether isopods habituated to sunfish chemicals.        2.  Long-term (24 days) exposure to fish chemicals did not affect growth or the extent of leaf processing by isopods in the laboratory.  Thus, chemical cues alone may not be important in triggering long-term predator avoidance behaviours that could potentially reduce fitness or affect community processes like litter breakdown.        3.  Isopods exposed to fish chemicals for 3, 9 and 15 days were significantly more active than individuals unexposed to fish chemicals, when transferred to another environment with fish chemicals.  This result, coupled with results of the growth experiment, suggests that isopods habituate to fish chemical stimuli and that time to habituation is c. 3 days or less.  Because fish chemicals can mislead prey about predator presence, and hence be a non-threatening stimulus, they are probably important in eliciting only short-term antipredatory behaviours by isopods.

We extend this modeling approach to include searcher responses to noisy sensory data. We explore the consequences of incorporating such sensory measurements into search behavior using simulations of a visual-olfactory predator in search of prey. Our results show that including even a simple response to noisy sensory data can dominate other features of random search, resulting in lower mean search times and decreased risk of long intervals between target encounters. In particular, we show that a lack of signal is not a lack of information. Searchers that receive no signal can quickly abandon target-poor regions. On the other hand, receiving a strong signal leads a searcher to concentrate search effort near targets. These responses cause simulated searchers to exhibit an emergent area-restricted search behavior similar to that observed of many organisms in nature.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  42     Total Times Cited:  42     Cited Reference Count:  26 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1073/pnas.1202686109     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),biological search;foraging;movement ecology;plume tracking;search algorithm;OLFACTORY SEARCH;LEVY;CONTEXT;STRATEGIES;PATTERNS;BEHAVIOR;Decision Making,,

Animal responses are manifold (immediate and/or delayed, short and/or long-lasting, with numerous behaviors affected) so that comprehensive studies are few. Here, we contrasted days with low or high tourism or hunting pressures to assess direct (daytime) and indirect (nighttime) responses of 66 GPS-collared Mediterranean mouflon Ovis gmelini musimon x Ovis sp. from the Caroux-Espinouse massif (southern France) in terms of movement, habitat use and daily activity. We took advantage of the fact that both human activities occurred during different periods and with different intensities in 3 contiguous areas (among which a protected area without hunting and with limited tourism) to compare their influence on mouflon behavior. Mouflon response to tourism was limited to the area where tourism pressure was intense with a decrease in diurnal activity compensated during nighttime by an increase of nocturnal activity. Hunting had marked consequences in the two hunted areas, with a similar shift in activity between day and night, a decrease in movement sinuosity during daytime by females and an increase in nocturnal use of the best foraging habitats by males, all suggesting an increase in foraging activities during nights following disturbance. The diurnal activity of mouflon living in the protected area was also modified during hunting period, but without nocturnal compensation. These findings revealed that the impact of hunting was higher than tourism, with several components of animal behavior affected. This calls for further research on hunting side-effects in terms of disturbance, especially as it occurs during both the adverse climatic season and the breeding period. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We evaluate the role of these factors in maintaining the Puerto Rican Parrot (Amazona vittata) in a prolonged bottleneck from 1973 through 2000 despite intensive conservation efforts. We first conduct a risk analysis, then examine evidence for the importance of specific processes maintaining the bottleneck using the multiple competing hypotheses approach, and finally integrate these results through a sensitivity analysis of a demographic model using life-stage simulation analysis (LSA) to determine the relative importance of genetic, demographic, environmental, and catastrophic processes on population growth. Annual population growth has been slow and variable (1.0 +/- 5.2 parrots per year, or an average lambda = 1.05 +/- 0.19) from 16 parrots (1973) to a high of 40-42 birds (1997-1998). A risk analysis based on population prediction intervals (PPI) indicates great risk and large uncertainty, with a range of 22-83 birds in the 90% PPI only five years into the future. Four primary factors (reduced hatching success due to inbreeding, failure of adults to nest, nest failure due to nongenetic causes, and reduced survival of adults and juveniles) were responsible for maintaining the bottleneck. Egg-hatchability rates were low (70.6% per egg and 76.8% per pair), and hatchability increased after mate changes, suggesting inbreeding effects. Only an average of 34% of the population nested annually, which was well below the percentage of adults that should have reached an age of first breeding (41-56%). This chronic failure to nest appears to have been caused primarily by environmental and/or behavioral factors, and not by nest-site scarcity or a skewed sex ratio. Nest failure rates from nongenetic causes (i.e., predation, parasitism, and wet cavities) were low (29%) due to active management (protecting nests and fostering captive young into wild nests), diminishing the importance of nest failure as a limiting factor. Annual survival has been periodically reduced by catastrophes (hurricanes), which have greatly constrained population growth, but survival rates were high under non-catastrophic conditions. Although the importance of factors maintaining the Puerto Rican Parrot bottleneck varied throughout the 30-year period of study, we determined their long-term influence using LSA simulations to correlate variation in demographic rates with variation in population growth (lambda). The bottleneck appears to have been maintained primarily by periodic catastrophes (hurricanes) that reduced adult survival, and secondarily by environmental and/or behavioral factors that resulted in a failure of many adults to nest. The influence of inbreeding through reduced hatching success played a much less significant role, even when additional effects of inbreeding on the production and mortality of young were incorporated into the LSA. Management actions needed to speed recovery include (1) continued nest guarding to minimize the effects of nest failure due to nongenetic causes; (2) creating a second population at another location on the island-a process that was recently initiated-to reduce the chance that hurricane strikes will cause extinction; and (3) determining the causes of the low percentage of breeders in the population and ameliorating them, which would have a large impact on population growth.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  41     Total Times Cited:  42     Cited Reference Count:  103 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1890/07-0018.1     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Amazona vittata;conservation;demographic model;demography;endangered species hatching failure;extinction;hurricane effects;Luquillo Experimental Forest;population bottleneck;Puerto Rican Parrot;sensitivity analysis;INBREEDING DEPRESSION;GENETIC-FACTORS;HURRICANE HUGO;ENVIRONMENTAL STOCHASTICITY;DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS;CONSERVATION GENETICS;DECLINING POPULATION;AMAZONA PARROTS;ISLAND ENDEMICS;SURVIVAL RATES;Hispanic Americans,,

The shape parameters describing positional distribution along the x-axis (mean, standard deviation (SD) and skewness) were differentiated according to source and time order (i.e., food first or predator first) of stimuli. Behavioral states were expressed by primary (mean and SD of x-coordinates) and secondary (skewness of x-coordinates) affectedness, and were addressed by specificity of individual response to stimuli. Even after adjusting spatial location and movement range in primary affectedness, secondary affectedness still occurred owing to a residual effect of the stimulus according to asymmetry of the positional distribution (e.g., away from the predator). Predator (as initial or secondary stimulus) produced stronger affectedness than food given as initial stimulus. Even after removal of initial stimulus, it still influenced affectedness of test organisms in the subsequent phases, implying memory effect of initial stimulus. Quantification of stress based on expression of behavioral state changes is feasible and could provide insight for monitoring based on indicator organism behavior under stressful conditions.

In spite of the fundamental differences between SD, a covariate that may not have any biological effect, and AD, a measure related to the behaviour of the animal, it is common to use SD as a proxy for AD when AD is hard to measure (e.g. in species that do not exhibit distinguishable alert postures). However, the relationship between SD and AD or FID may not have any biological reasons, but may instead simply result from a mathematical artefact because of the constraints SD = AD = FID. Under such constrains, the homoscedasticity assumption is violated, and thus, the classical null hypothesis of linear regression (slope = 0) is invalid. In this study, we first show that using SD as a proxy for AD can strongly affect the results on FID. Using data from FID tests on alpine marmots (Marmota marmota), a linear mixed model with AD as a covariate, suggested that the interaction between previous activity and AD had an effect on FID, while this effect was not detected when SD replaced AD as the covariate in the analysis. We then propose that the actual statistical test of the relationship between SD, AD and FID should be based on a null hypothesis that incorporates the constraint SD = AD = FID = 0 and generate 95% CI of simulated slopes obtained from random values under this constraint. This null hypothesis can be rejected if the observed slope of the relationship between two of these variables is outside the 95% CI. We demonstrated that, for alpine marmots, the observed slope of the relationship between AD and SD was within the 95% CI of the simulated slopes. The absence of a statistically significant biological effect in the relationship between SD and AD raises important questions on the outcome of relationship between SD and FID. In Alpine marmot flight, decision should be studied separating the effect of SD on AD and the effect of AD on FID.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  46     Total Times Cited:  48     Cited Reference Count:  52 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/eth.12006     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),BLACK-TAILED DEER;PREDATION RISK;HUMAN DISTURBANCE;ESCAPE BEHAVIOR;LIMITED ATTENTION;TOLERANCE;BIRDS;COST;METAANALYSIS;RESPONSES;Mathematics,,

In this study, we conducted habitat choice experiments to determine how water temperature influences habitat preference for three common species of coral reef damselfish (Pomacentridae) that differ in their levels of habitat specialisation. The lemon damselfish Pomacentrus moluccensis, a habitat specialist, consistently selected complex coral habitat across all temperature treatments (selected based on local average seasonal temperatures naturally experienced insitu: ambient winter 22 degrees C; ambient summer 28 degrees C; and elevated 31 degrees C). Unexpectedly, the neon damselfish Pomacentrus coelestis and scissortail sergeant Abudefduf sexfasciatus, both of which have more generalist habitat associations, developed strong habitat preferences (for complex coral and boulder habitat, respectively) at the elevated temperature treatment (31 degrees C) compared to no single preferred habitat at 22 degrees C or 28 degrees C. The observed shifts in habitat preference with temperature suggest that we may be currently underestimating the vulnerability of some habitat generalists to climate change and highlight that the ongoing loss of complex live coral through coral bleaching could further exacerbate resource overlap and species competition in ways not currently considered in climate change models.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  11     Total Times Cited:  11     Cited Reference Count:  111 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/gcb.14166     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),behaviour;climate change;coral reefs;damselfish;habitat association;marine fish;resource specialisation;warming;REGION-WIDE DECLINES;CLIMATE-CHANGE;PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY;LONG-TERM;DEPENDENT BIOGEOGRAPHY;ELEVATED-TEMPERATURE;FITNESS CONSEQUENCES;THERMAL TOLERANCE;COMPETITION;PREDATION,,

A major question is what processes generate this variation. Here we apply multi-year manipulations of perceived predation levels (PPL) in an avian predator-prey system, identifying phenotypic plasticity in phenology as a key component of alternative behavioral strategies with equal fitness payoffs. We show that under low-PPL, faster (versus slower) exploring birds breed late (versus early); the pattern is reversed under high-PPL, with breeding synchrony decreasing in conjunction. Timing of breeding affects reproductive success, yet behavioral types have equal fitness. The existence of alternative behavioral strategies thus explains variation in phenology and plasticity in reproductive behavior, which has implications for evolution in response to anthropogenic change.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  21     Total Times Cited:  21     Cited Reference Count:  50 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1038/s41467-019-09138-5     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),LIKELIHOOD RATIO TESTS;CLUTCH SIZE;EXPLORATORY-BEHAVIOR;GREAT TITS;PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY;GENETIC-VARIATION;REACTION NORMS;RISK;SYNCHRONY;SELECTION;Prednisolone,,

We evaluated the isotopic niche of an apex carnivore, the cougar (Puma concolor), over broad spatiotemporal scales and in a region characterized by rapid landscape change. We detected a shift in resource use, from near complete specialization on native herbivores in wildlands to greater use of exotic and invasive species by cougars in contemporary urban interfaces. We show that 25 years ago, cougars inhabiting these same urban interfaces possessed diets that were intermediate. Thus, niche expansion followed human expansion over both time and space, indicating that an important top predator is interacting with prey in novel ways. Thus, though human-dominated landscapes can provide sufficient resources for apex carnivores, they do not necessarily preserve their ecological relationships.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  28     Total Times Cited:  29     Cited Reference Count:  36 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1038/srep39639     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),LARGE CARNIVORE;MOUNTAIN LIONS;LANDSCAPE;URBANIZATION;MESOPREDATOR;INTERFACE;RISK;Humanities;Humanism;Humans;Prednisolone,,

We use two predator-prey systems, one with a fixed carrying capacity and one in which the carrying capacity is an emergent property compounded of an intrinsic growth rate and a susceptibility to crowding. We consider prey evolution in both systems and link the evolving parameters by a trade-off which requires that prey with higher per capita growth experience a greater risk of predation. We find that the two approaches for representing the carrying capacity can lead to markedly different evolutionary behaviour. In particular, the possibility of exhibiting evolutionary branching requires an emergent carrying capacity. This is significant, since evolutionary branching is regarded as a possible mechanism by which sympatric speciation may occur.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  34     Total Times Cited:  35     Cited Reference Count:  19 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",,adaptive dynamics;carrying capacity;evolutionary branching;speciation;LOGISTIC EQUATION;DYNAMICS,,

However, for some animals-especially ones that spend long periods of time feeding-there are costs if a group chooses to move on before their nutritional needs are satisfied. If the conflict between feeding and keeping up with a group becomes too large, it may be advantageous for some groups of animals to split into subgroups with similar nutritional needs. We model the costs and benefits of splitting in a herd of cows using a cost function that quantifies individual variation in hunger, desire to lie down, and predation risk. We model the costs associated with hunger and lying desire as the standard deviations of individuals within a group, and we model predation risk as an inverse exponential function of the group size. We minimize the cost function over all plausible groups that can arise from a given herd and study the dynamics of group splitting. We examine how the cow dynamics and cost function depend on the parameters in the model and consider two biologically-motivated examples: (1) group switching and group fission in a herd of relatively homogeneous cows, and (2) a herd with an equal number of adult males (larger animals) and adult females (smaller animals).

In recent years, their natural environment is being intensively altered by the construction of offshore wind farms in many coastal areas. These constructions form artificial reefs influencing local biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. It has been demonstrated that Atlantic cod is present in the vicinity of these constructions. However, empirical data concerning the diel activity and feeding behaviour of Atlantic cod in the vicinity of these artificial reefs is lacking. Atlantic cod has a flexible diel activity cycle linked to spatio-temporal variations in food availability and predation risk. In this study we integrated acoustic telemetry with stomach content analysis to quantify diel activity and evaluate diel feeding patterns at a windmill artificial reef (WAR) in the Belgian part of the North Sea. Atlantic cod exhibited crepuscular movements related to feeding activity; a 12 h cycle was found and the highest catch rates and stomach fullness were recorded close to sunset and sunrise. It is suggested that the observed diel movement pattern is related to the prey species community and to predation pressure. Foraging at low ambient light levels (i.e. at dusk and dawn) probably causes a trade-off between foraging success and reducing predation pressure.

We examine the mistaken identity hypothesis, which posits that non-copulatory cannibalism occurs because females do not recognize conspecific males as potential mates. This hypothesis predicts indiscriminate predatory behavior by females towards conspecific males and heterospecific prey. This prediction remains largely unexamined. We tested this prediction in the praying mantis Mantis religiosa (Mantodea: Mantidae) through two behavioral experiments. In experiment 1, we presented targets in isolation to females: dead conspecific males or dead common prey items from the field (grasshopper Chrysochraon dispar). In experiment 2, we presented simultaneous live targets to females: conspecific males and grasshoppers. In both experiments, we varied female mating status (virgin vs. mated). Results indicate some degree of attack discrimination by the females. In experiment 1, the females were significantly more likely to strike at the grasshoppers, and showed a shorter latency to strike at grasshoppers. In experiment 2, females tended to preferentially strike at the grasshoppers, although this result fell short of statistical significance. Female discrimination between the males and grasshoppers may be explained, in part, by the size difference between the males and grasshoppers. Female mating status did not affect the occurrence or latency to strike in either experiment. These results fail to strongly support the prediction of indiscriminate predatory behavior by females, while contributing to a broader taxonomic assessment of the mistaken identity hypothesis.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  2     Cited Reference Count:  59 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s10164-016-0458-8     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Attack discrimination;Mistaken identity;Sexual cannibalism;Praying mantis;Mantis religiosa;AGGRESSIVE SPILLOVER HYPOTHESIS;STAGMOMANTIS-LIMBATA MANTODEA;MALE MATING-BEHAVIOR;SEXUAL CANNIBALISM;TENODERA-ARIDIFOLIA;DEFENSIVE BEHAVIOR;MALE SACRIFICE;SIZE;COURTSHIP;RISK;Discrimination (Psychology),,

For example, birds can increase body mass in response to lower availability and/or predictability of food and decrease body mass in response to increased predation danger. Birds also demonstrate an ability to maintain body mass across a range of food qualities. Although the adaptive significance of mass regulation has received a great deal of theoretical and empirical attention, the mechanisms by which birds achieve this have not. Several non-exclusive mechanisms could facilitate mass regulation in birds. Birds could regulate body mass by adjusting food intake (dieting), activity, baseline energetic requirements (basal metabolic rate), mitochondrial efficiency or assimilation efficiency. Here, we present the results of two experiments in captive red knots (Calidris canutus islandica) that assess three of these proposed mechanisms: dieting, activity and up-and down-regulation of metabolic rate. In the first experiment, knots were exposed to cues of predation risk that led them to exhibit presumably adaptive mass loss. In the second experiment, knots maintained constant body mass despite being fed alternating high-and low-quality diets. In both experiments, regulation of body mass was achieved through a combination of changes in food intake and activity. Both experiments also provide some evidence for a role of metabolic adjustments. Taken together, these two experiments demonstrate that fine-scale management of body mass in knots is achieved through multiple mechanisms acting simultaneously.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  71 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1242/jeb.231993     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Activity;Diet;Food quality;Mass loss;Mass regulation in birds;DISTANCE MIGRANT SHOREBIRD;AFFECTS FORAGING DECISIONS;BASAL METABOLIC-RATES;TIT FAT RESERVES;PREDATION RISK;ENERGY-EXPENDITURE;DEPENDENT PREDATION;SMALL BIRDS;INCREASE;BEHAVIOR,,

Here we detail our experiences in capturing, immobilizing, and placing GPS collars on six olive baboons (Papio anubis) in four groups and 12 vervet monkeys (Chlorocebus pygerythrus) in five groups in Kenya. We captured baboons with cage traps and vervets with box traps, immobilized them, and attached GPS collars that were to be worn for 1 year. Adverse consequences from the trapping effort included incidental death of two nonsubjects (an adult female and her dependent infant), temporary rectal prolapse in one baboon, superficial wounds on the crown of the head in two vervets, and failure to recapture/remove collars from two baboons and two vervets. Obvious negative effects from wearing collars were limited to abrasions around the neck of one vervet. A possible, and if so, serious, adverse effect was greater mortality for collared adult female vervets compared with known uncollared adult female vervets, largely due to leopard (Panthera pardus) predation. Collared animals could be more vulnerable to predation because trapping favors bolder individuals, who may also be more vulnerable to predation, or because collars could slow them down or make them more noticeable to predators. Along with recommendations made by others, we suggest that future studies diversify trapping bait to minimize the risk of rectal prolapse, avoid capturing the first individuals to enter traps, test the movement speeds of collared versus noncollared animals, include a release system on the collars to avoid retrapping failure, and publish both positive and negative effects of capturing, immobilizing, and collaring.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  3     Total Times Cited:  3     Cited Reference Count:  71 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1002/ajp.22997     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),adverse effects of collars;biotelemetry;Global Positioning Systems;positive outcomes;primates;MONKEYS CERCOPITHECUS-AETHIOPS;CHACMA BABOONS;GPS TECHNOLOGY;SAMPLING BIAS;NATIONAL-PARK;WILD;MORTALITY;PRIMATES;BEHAVIOR;PREDATION;Papio,,

African lion (Panthera leo) populations have decreased significantly in recent decades with an estimated 23 000 lions left in Africa. Successful conservation efforts rely on a sound understanding of how animals utilize their surrounding habitat. We used movement data from GPS collars to investigate patterns and drivers of seasonal space use by free-roaming lions in the Greater Mapungubwe Transfrontier Conservation Area (GM-TFCA). We developed individual and population-level resource utilization functions (RUF) from 2008 to 2015. RUFs relate non-uniform space use within a home range to landscape metrics in a multiple regression framework. We identified six landscape features hypothesized a priori to be good predictors of lion space use: land use, land cover, elevation, terrain ruggedness, distance to human settlements and rivers. Only elevation during the dry season was a significant factor detected for lion space use ((beta) over cap +/- S.E.) (-0.278 +/- 0.107. CI = -0.4881, -0.0676). Across seasons, lions varied in their avoidance of human settlements, but 12 of 18 (67%) individuals selected areas within their home ranges that were farther from human settlements. Lions moved randomly across the landscape independent of vegetation type regardless of season. In season-specific analyses, some lions avoided human settlements (dry season: 45%, [n = 10] utilized areas farther from settlements; wet season: 50% [n = 9]). The lack of avoidance of settlements by some lions in our study also confirms that individual variation among lions can lead to human-wildlife conflicts. Perhaps the most critical observation from our study is that individual lions acted very differently as they used the landscape, which suggests the need for management plans to be landscape and case-specific.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  2     Total Times Cited:  2     Cited Reference Count:  70 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.3957/056.048.023001     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),African lion;Botswana;carnivore;Panthera;resource utilization;savanna;space use;RESOURCE SELECTION;NATIONAL-PARK;HUNTING SUCCESS;EXTINCTION RISK;PREY;LANDSCAPE;BEHAVIOR;POPULATIONS;AUTOCORRELATION;PREDATORS,,

We compare predictions for solitary and social provisioners, and for three foraging currencies. When distinct food patches with identical food parameters are considered, fewer provisioners use the farther patches. The rate of decline in number of provisioners depends on the currency used. With net rate of energy intake (net energy gain over time), the rate of decline is relatively small under a wide range of realistic parameter values and distances; with efficiency (net energy gain over energy cost) and empirically derived energetic costs, the rate of decline is much higher. With lifetime fitness (lifetime food delivery under predation risk), outcomes depend on the ratio of mortality risk during flight and during food collection at the patch. With all currencies, there is a difference between the optimal spatial distribution of solitary and social provisioners, with a larger proportion of social provisioners being farther from the central place. The optimal distribution of solitary provisioners in a two dimensional field of uniformly distributed food such as a flowering meadow is such that the density of solitary provisioners (number per unit area) declines monotonically with distance, and provisioner number peaks at half the maximum area used.

Bioenergetics model results, however, sometimes conflict with common assumptions. Previous studies plus ""Wisconsin model"" bioenergetics simulations lead to four conclusions that conflict with some management assumptions. The first conclusion is that food consumption is at least as important as temperature in explaining growth; we cannot understand temperature effects without understanding food consumption. Second, at natural food consumption rates, there is no ""optimal temperature for growth""; growth peaks in model results are artifacts of food consumption assumptions, and growth peaks in laboratory studies are (apparently) artifacts of ad libitum feeding. Third, effects of temperature on growth can be stronger during cooler seasons than in summer; traditional temperature criteria are not useful for managing such effects. Fourth, salmonid populations that are adapted to survive higher temperatures may be more, not less, vulnerable to temperature effects on growth due to their higher metabolic rates. Temperature-growth relations observed under ad libitum feeding seem risky for managing wild populations. Model predictions of growth need to carefully consider assumptions about food consumption. For predicting effects of increased temperature, the traditional assumption that consumption is a constant fraction of maximum consumption rate appears especially uncertain and incautious, with its hidden assumption that consumption increases with temperature; assuming a constant ration is simpler and more cautious. Growth can be predicted more reliably with feeding models and individual-based population models that consider how consumption and energetic costs depend on processes such as habitat selection, competition, and adaptive behaviors involving tradeoffs between food intake and predation risk. Two research needs are clear: empirical observations for parameterizing and testing the Wisconsin model comprehensively under natural conditions (which we lack despite the extensive energetics literature), and methods for predicting salmonid food production responses to temperature and flow regimes.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  1     Total Times Cited:  1     Cited Reference Count:  43 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1002/tafs.10338     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),RAINBOW-TROUT;BIOENERGETICS MODEL;THERMAL TOLERANCE;FOOD-CONSUMPTION;CUTTHROAT TROUT;RATION;STREAM;SELECTION;Temperature,,

Optimal foraging theory assumes that foraging behavior has evolved to maximize fitness and provides a conceptual framework in which environmental quality is often assumed to be fixed. Another more mechanistic conceptual framework comes from the successive contrast effects (SCE) approach in which the conditions that an individual has experienced in the recent past alter its response to current conditions. By regarding foragers' estimation of resource patches as subjective future value assessments, SCE may be integrated into an optimal foraging framework to generate novel predictions. We released Allenby's gerbils (Gerbillus andersoni allenbyi) into an enclosure containing rich patches with equal amounts of food and manipulated the quality of the environment over time by reducing the amount of food in most (but not all) food patches and then increasing it again. We found that, as predicted by optimal foraging models, gerbils increased their foraging activity in the rich patch when the environment became poor. However, when the environment became rich again, the gerbils significantly altered their behavior compared to the first identical rich period. Specifically, in the second rich period, the gerbils spent more time foraging and harvested more food from the patches. Thus, seemingly identical environments can be treated as strikingly different by foragers as a function of their past experiences and future expectations.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  9     Total Times Cited:  9     Cited Reference Count:  46 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s00265-014-1785-9     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Bayesian foraging;Successive contrast effects;Experience;Learning;Missed opportunity cost;Optimal foraging theory;PATCH-USE;PREDATION RISK;CONTRAST;INFORMATION;BEHAVIOR;DENSITY;GERBILS;CHOICE;GAMES;DIET,,

Here, we (i) outline a framework for how interactions among large mammalian herbivores, carnivores and environmental variation influence herbivore habitat occupancy in tropical savannahs. We then (ii) use a Bayesian hierarchical model to analyse camera trap data to quantify spatial patterns of habitat occupancy for lions and eight common ungulates of varying body size across an approximately 1100 km(2) landscape in the Serengeti ecosystem. Our results reveal strong positive associations among herbivores at the scale of the entire landscape. Lions were positively associated with migratory ungulates but negatively associated with residents. Herbivore habitat occupancy differed with body size and migratory strategy: large-bodied migrants, at less risk of predation and able to tolerate lower quality food, were associated with high NDVI, while smaller residents, constrained to higher quality forage, avoided these areas. Small herbivores were strongly associated with fires, likely due to the subsequent high-quality regrowth, while larger herbivores avoided burned areas. Body mass was strongly related to herbivore habitat use, with larger species more strongly associated with riverine and woodlands than smaller species.

In the degenerate systems of Lotka-Volterra, there is a continuum of types of consumer and resource based on variation of a single trait (characteristic, or preference). The consumers experience competition for a continuum of resource types. This non-local interaction system is modeled with partial differential-integral equations and shows spontaneous self-structuring of the consumer population that depends on the degree of interaction degeneracy between resource and consumer, but does not mirror the distribution of resource. We also show that the classical Verhulst (i.e. logistic) single population model can be generalized to a degenerate model, which shows qualitative behavior similar to that in the degenerate Lotka-Volterra model.

We compared the escape behavior of Anolis lizards during simulated predator approaches on trees in both urban and forest habitats and on artificial structures (i.e., cement walls and metal posts) in urban areas. We found that urban lizards were less wary on trees, likely due at least in part to habituation to humans. In contrast, lizards on cement walls showed greater wariness, which may reflect a behavioral modification when escaping because of poor locomotor performance on this substrate. In both habitats, lizards modulated escape responses in ways consistent with their performance abilities on the various substrates. Escape by jumping decreased when lizards used wider and more isolated perches, which are characteristic of urban sites. Urban lizards squirreled (i.e., moved to the opposite side of a structure) more on wider trees and metal posts, and sprinted more but never jumped from cement walls. These behavioral responses for predator escape are consistent with the structural habitat changes caused by urbanization. Urban habitats had larger diameter trees, sparser ground vegetation, and many artificial structures. We found that urban lizards showed behavioral modulations because of exposure to humans as well as the locomotor constraints of using some artificial structures, such as cement walls. The ability of urban lizards to alter their escape responses and adjust to novel features of the habitat may be important traits of species able to colonize and persist in urban areas.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  11     Total Times Cited:  11     Cited Reference Count:  68 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s11252-019-00845-x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Anolis cristatellus;Anole;Artificial substrates;Habituation;Flight-initiation distance;Structural habitat;FLIGHT INITIATION DISTANCE;TROPICAL LIZARD;RISK-ASSESSMENT;PERCH DIAMETER;URBAN;HABITAT;PERFORMANCE;MORPHOLOGY;HABITUATION;LOCOMOTION;Lizards,,

If such a currency exists, then it is tempting to argue that the selective forces that have shaped the evolution of foraging behaviour have been understood. We review previous work on currencies for the foraging behaviour of an animal that maximizes total energy gained. In many circumstances, it is optimal to maximize a suitably modified form of efficiency. We show how energy gain, predation and damage can be combined in a single currency based on reproductive value. We draw attention to the idea that hard work may have an adverse effect on an animal's condition. We develop a model of optimal foraging over a day when a forager's state consists of its energy reserves and its condition. Optimal foraging behaviour in our model depends on energy reserves, condition and time of day. The pattern of optimal behaviour depends strongly on assumptions about the probability that the forager is killed by a predator. If condition is important, no simple currency characterizes foraging behaviour, but behaviour can be understood in terms of the maximization of reproductive value. It may be optimal to adopt a foraging option that results in a rate of energy expenditure that is less than the rate associated with maximizing efficiency.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  60     Total Times Cited:  61     Cited Reference Count:  73 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/1365-2656.12096     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),condition;constraint;daily routine;efficiency;energy expenditure;foraging;net rate;SMALL BIRDS;ENERGY-EXPENDITURE;DIET OPTIMIZATION;OXIDATIVE STRESS;DYNAMIC-MODEL;TIME;PARENT;WINTER;STATE;RISK,,

Chordates have two basic modes of development, indirect and direct. Species with indirect development, which includes most fishes and amphibians, have a complex life cycle with a free-swimming larva that is typically a growth stage, followed by a metamorphosis into the adult form. Species with direct development, which is an evolutionarily derived developmental mode, develop directly from embryo to the juvenile without an intervening larval stage. Among the best studied species with complex life cycles are the amphibians, especially the anurans (frogs and toads). Amphibian tadpoles are exposed to diverse biotic and abiotic factors in their developmental habitat. They have extensive capacity for developmental plasticity, which can lead to the expression of different, adaptive morphologies as tadpoles (polyphenism), variation in the timing of and size at metamorphosis, and carry-over effects on the phenotype of the juvenile/adult. The neuroendocrine stress axis plays a pivotal role in mediating environmental effects on amphibian development. Before initiating metamorphosis, if tadpoles are exposed to predators they upregulate production of the stress hormone corticosterone (CORT), which acts directly on the tail to cause it to grow, thereby increasing escape performance. When tadpoles reach a minimum body size to initiate metamorphosis they can vary the timing of transformation in relation to growth opportunity or mortality risk in the larval habitat. They do this by modulating the production of thyroid hormone (TH), the primary inducer of metamorphosis, and CORT, which synergizes with TH to promote tissue transformation. Hypophysiotropic neurons that release the stress neurohormone corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) are activated in response to environmental stress (e.g., pond drying, food restriction, etc.), and CRF accelerates metamorphosis by directly inducing secretion of pituitary thyrotropin and corticotropin, thereby increasing secretion of TH and CORT. Although activation of the neuroendocrine stress axis promotes immediate survival in a deteriorating larval habitat, costs may be incurred such as reduced tadpole growth and size at metamorphosis. Small size at transformation can impair performance of the adult, reducing probability of survival in the terrestrial habitat, or fecundity. Furthermore, elevations in CORT in the tadpole caused by environmental stressors cause long term, stable changes in neuroendocrine function, behavior and physiology of the adult, which can affect fitness. Comparative studies show that the roles of stress hormones in developmental plasticity are conserved across vertebrate taxa including humans.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  4     Total Times Cited:  4     Cited Reference Count:  233 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.ynstr.2021.100301     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Developmental plasticity;Corticotropin-releasing factor;Glucocorticoid;Thyroid hormone;Metamorphosis;Amphibian;CORTICOTROPIN-RELEASING-FACTOR;WHOLE-BODY CORTICOSTERONE;PREDATION RISK-ASSESSMENT;WESTERN SPADEFOOT TOAD;FACTOR CRF FAMILY;THYROID-HORMONE;XENOPUS-LAEVIS;PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY;AMPHIBIAN METAMORPHOSIS;GLUCOCORTICOID-RECEPTOR,,

Animals can certainly behave as though they are optimistic or pessimistic with respect to specific motivations, as documented by an extensive range of examples in the literature. However, in surveying such examples we find that these terms are often poorly defined and are liable to lead to confusion. Furthermore, when considering behaviour within the framework of optimal decision theory using appropriate currencies, it is often misleading to describe animals as optimistic or pessimistic. There are two common misunderstandings. First, some apparent cases of biased behaviour result from misidentifying the currencies and pay-offs the animals should be maximising. Second, actions that do not maximise short-term pay-offs have sometimes been described as optimistic or pessimistic when in fact they are optimal in the long term; we show how such situations can be understood from the perspective of bandit models. Rather than describing suboptimal, unrealistic behaviour, the terms optimism and pessimism are better restricted to informal usage.

This is not uncommon in family groups of diverse taxa, where the dependent offspring compete for the limited resources provided by their parents. Killing a nest mate can relax the level of competition, and cannibalism provides a direct nutritional benefit. However, nest-mate killing bears the risk of reducing indirect fitness if the victim is related (i.e., siblicide), imposing selection on kin-recognition abilities. Based on this hypothesis, we predicted that first instar juveniles (nymphs) of the European earwig (Forficula auricularia) kill and cannibalize unrelated nest mates earlier and more often than related nest mates and that cannibalism has a direct nutritional benefit in terms of survival. We tested these predictions experimentally by establishing related and unrelated pairs of nymphs and recorded survival, aggregation behavior, and cannibalistic outcomes in the absence of alternative food sources. In order to obtain expected survival probabilities of victims and survivors in the absence of any interaction, we simulated virtual nymph pairs based on survival data of singly held control individuals. As predicted, victims lived for less time and survivor for longer than expected from the simulated survival distributions, demonstrating nest-mate killing and cannibalism. Furthermore, unrelated individuals were killed significantly earlier and were more often cannibalized than related individuals. The survival patterns of victims and survivors were quantitatively consistent with the expectations of Hamilton's rule. Our study shows that earwig nymphs recognize kin and adjust their nest-mate killing and cannibalistic behavior as predicted under the hypothesis of kin-selected siblicide and cannibalism.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  44     Total Times Cited:  46     Cited Reference Count:  47 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1093/beheco/arp184     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Forficula auricularia;Hamilton's rule;intraspecific predation;kin recognition;sibling rivalry;FORFICULA-AURICULARIA;SIBLING CANNIBALISM;SUBSOCIAL SPIDER;GENETIC KIN;RECOGNITION;EVOLUTION;POPULATIONS;COMPETITION;CONFLICT;LIFE,,

Ectotherms engage in behavioral thermoregulation to optimize body temperatures, however, thermoregulatory effort varies across species, over time, and among habitats. Classic cost-benefit models of ectothermic thermoregulation postulate that ectotherms should increase thermoregulatory effort when the benefits of thermoregulatory behavior outweigh the costs (Huey and Slatkin, 1976). However, alteration of habitat via land management may lead to unforeseen shifts in microclimate that change associated costs and benefits. In light of anthropogenic impacts on natural habitats, thermoregulatory effort should be examined in cases where land management results in environmental temperatures that deviate from the preferred temperature range of a given species.        2. We examined how habitat management alters microclimates and influences activity time, thermoregulatory behavior, and thermal physiology in a lizard (Sceloporus woodi) whose range has been significantly reduced due to habitat loss. We compared populations from two ecologically distinct habitats: longleaf pine and sand pine scrub, which have very different management histories. Daily surveys were conducted in each habitat type while environmental temperatures were recorded simultaneously with biophysical models.        3. Thermal performance curves differed between populations such that physiological performance was optimized in each environment. Longleaf pine habitat had greater thermal opportunity because cooler microclimates were available on arboreal perches. In longleaf pine habitat, lizards were able to stay active longer and thermoregulate more effectively. Regardless of habitat, thermoregulatory effort of S. woodi increased when thermal quality of habitat was low. However, when unfavorably high temperatures were experienced, the thermoregulatory effort increased significantly.        4. Our results demonstrate that ectotherms can afford to imprecisely thermoregulate when habitat thermal quality is poor due to cooler environmental temperatures. However under unfavorably hot environmental temperatures, lizards must precisely regulate body temperature in spite of any costs. These results further demonstrate that habitat management has major implications on species-specific thermal opportunity, thermoregulatory behavior, and thermal physiology, such that shifts in thermoregulatory behavior may lead to higher energetic costs, enhanced predation risk, and constrained activity times.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  17     Total Times Cited:  17     Cited Reference Count:  82 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/1365-2435.13123     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),adaptation;habitat management;lizard;operative temperature;thermal performance curve;thermal physiology;thermoregulation;FLORIDA SCRUB LIZARD;COST-BENEFIT MODEL;CLIMATE-CHANGE;SPRINT SPEED;LAND-USE;BEHAVIORAL THERMOREGULATION;PHYSIOLOGICAL PERFORMANCE;INTRASPECIFIC VARIATION;OPERATIVE TEMPERATURE;SCELOPORUS-WOODI;Ecosystem,,

Seals use these fjords in peak numbers during the critical periods of pupping, breeding, and molting when visits by tour ships also peak. Documented and suspected declines of harbor seals in fjords with rising vessel traffic underscore the need to better understand possible impacts, particularly in areas where ship visits have risen substantially in the past 2 decades. We examined the interruption of haul-out bouts of harbor seals due to approaching cruise ships in Disenchantment Bay, Alaska. We conducted observations from cruise ships and focused on disturbance of seals as evidenced by seals flushing into the water from the floating ice on which they rested. We investigated rate of flushing in relation to vessel distance, approach angle, group size, and seal type (mother, pup, or other). Using a survival-regression analysis, we found that the risk of disturbing harbor seals increased when ships approached within 500 m; seals approached as close as 100 m were 25 times more likely to enter the water than seals 500 m from a ship. Seals were 4 times more prone to enter the water when ships were approaching directly rather than passing abeam. Seals responded similarly regardless of group size or seal type. Energetic models indicated a potential to disrupt energy balance and cause thermal stress in disturbed pups if they spent >50% of their time in ice-chilled water. Studies at non-glacial sites suggest that pups spend 40-70% of their time in the water. Voluntary guidelines for approaching seals in Alaska recommend that cruise ships approach >= 91 m (100 yards), a distance at which we show 90% of seals would flush into the water. Our findings indicate a need to develop regulations to maintain a 500-m separation between cruise ships and seals in all Alaskan glacial fjords.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  32     Total Times Cited:  33     Cited Reference Count:  53 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.2193/2008-192     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Alaska;cruise ships;disturbance;energetics;harbor seal;haul-out behavior;Phoca vitulina;predation;survival analysis;thermoregulation;PHOCA-VITULINA-RICHARDSI;SEASONAL-CHANGES;GLACIER BAY;BEHAVIOR;MASS;HAUL;PERFORMANCE;CONSTRAINTS;METABOLISM;LACTATION,,

In this study we present a mathematical analysis on a widely occurring type of prey defense whose behavior has not been established in exact terms. The study model considers prey whose average immunity to predators is enhanced by predator abundance. This case, known as inducible defenses, has been reported for a wide array of species. Our results reveal a rich dynamic behavior, in which the predator-prey system exhibits either one, two or three positive equilibrium points, with up to two attractors.

The present imprecise model is constructed, in part, by modifications to the Lotka-Volterra model with appropriate biology parameters taken as intervals. The Holling type II functional response is considered instead of the Holling Type I functional response, along with the predators' interaction with themselves. Using a linear parametric representation of the interval, we can represent the imprecise model in a parametric form precisely. Next, we analyse the mathematical properties of the proposed model, like finding equilibrium with various stability conditions and investigating several bifurcations of the system. The justifications of all analytical results for our system are illustrated numerically with the interval-valued data of parameters, and the simulated results are express graphically. Finally, we conclude our work with suggestions and analyse the biological significance of our findings through numerical evaluations.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  44 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1140/epjp/s13360-021-02308-9     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),OPTIMAL HARVESTING POLICY;FOOD-CHAIN MODEL;SYSTEM;FEAR;Prednisolone,,

In Ostariophysi species, club cells in the epidermis are believed to contain cues related to alarm substance; however, the function of club cells, primarily as reservoirs of alarm substance has been debated. Here, I describe an alarm response in the Japanese rice fish Oryzias latipes (medaka), a member of the order Beloniformes. The response to alarm substance (Schreckreaction) in medaka is characterized by bouts of immobility and an increase in cortisol levels within minutes of exposure to conspecific skin extract. Histological analysis, however, suggests that club cells are either rare or absent in the medaka epidermis. In addition to describing an uncharacterized behavior in a vertebrate popular for genetic and developmental studies, these results support the hypothesis that the primary function of epidermal club cells may be unrelated to a role as alarm substance cells. The existence of similar behavioral responses in two evolutionarily distant but well established laboratory models, the zebrafish and the medaka, offers the possibility of comparative analyses of neural circuits encoding innate fear.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  10     Total Times Cited:  10     Cited Reference Count:  55 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1038/srep36615     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),PREDATION RISK;RESPONSES;SUBSTANCE;ZEBRAFISH;CORTISOL;FISHES;CUES;COMMUNICATION;EVOLUTION;ODORANTS,,

It is the last category that is the focus of this review: group living as protection from predation. The drivers of group life in the face of danger are at the same time diverse and interlinked, with much potential for confusion between concepts. Here we review these concepts, using the dilution effect as a starting point. We construct a mathematical model that allows us to examine various features of the dilution effect and their connection to ecology. We also show the importance of including a time scale when modelling the dilution effect and how this translates into more realistic estimation of the fitness consequences of a diluted predation risk. The central role of the dilution effect in creating safety in numbers is underlined by showing how it may affect life-history evolution and result in the emergence of gregarious life-history strategies, even among sessile organisms limited in their abilities to exhibit behavioural responses to predation. Finally, we review the other central processes underpinning group protection from predation: the satiation effect, selfish herding, the confusion effect and group vigilance.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  61     Total Times Cited:  61     Cited Reference Count:  86 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s00265-016-2075-5     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Selfish herding;Predator-prey interactions;Predation rate;Stochastic process;Group formation;Life-history evolution;GROUP-SIZE;PREDATION RISK;FUNCTIONAL-RESPONSE;SHOAL SIZE;EVOLUTION;BEHAVIOR;VIGILANCE;BENEFITS;DENSITY;ADVANTAGES,,

Despite the ubiquity of phenotypic variation within natural populations, its effects on the dynamics of ecological communities are not well understood. Here, we use a quantitative genetics framework to examine how phenotypic variation in a predator affects the outcome of apparent competition between its two prey species. Classical apparent competition theory predicts that prey have reciprocally negative effects on each other. The addition of phenotypic trait variation in predation can marginalize these negative effects, mediate coexistence, or generate positive indirect effects between the prey species. Long-term coexistence or facilitation, however, can be preceded by long transients of extinction risk whenever the heritability of phenotypic variation is low. Greater heritability can circumvent these ecological transients but also can generate oscillatory and chaotic dynamics. These dramatic changes in ecological outcomes, in the sign of indirect effects, and in stability suggest that studies which ignore intraspecific trait variation may reach fundamentally incorrect conclusions regarding ecological dynamics.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  106     Total Times Cited:  107     Cited Reference Count:  69 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",,apparent competition;genetic variation;heritability;phenotypic variation;predator-prey interaction;quantitative genetics;ENEMY-FREE-SPACE;APPARENT COMPETITION;INTRASPECIFIC COMPETITION;ECOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES;STABILIZING SELECTION;PREY INTERACTIONS;POLYGENIC TRAITS;RAPID EVOLUTION;HABITAT USE;DYNAMICS;Genetic Variation;Phenotype;Prednisolone,,

However, we have a poor understanding of animals' capability to select an appropriate flight trajectory. We investigated whether eastern gray squirrels would adjust their flight trajectory based on the relative locations of the squirrel, the approaching threat, and potential refuges. We used a person running toward a focal squirrel (N = 122) as the threat and considered the three trees nearest the squirrel and taller than 8m to be potential refuges. Squirrels were strongly affected by the angle (theta) formed by the locations of person, squirrel, and the three nearest trees. A squirrel was less likely to run to the nearest tree (Tree 1) when theta(1) was relatively acute, but also less likely to run to Tree 1 when theta(2) was obtuse, making Tree 2 a more attractive refuge. A squirrel was more likely to run to Tree 1 if it was close and if Tree 2 was relatively far. Subtle differences in the effects of theta(1) vs. theta(2) on squirrel refuge choice support the idea that squirrels prefer a nearby refuge. Squirrels were more likely to select Trees 2 and 3 rather than Tree 1 only when theta(2) was obtuse (105 degrees). In contrast, most squirrels chose to run to Tree 1 when theta(1) was >65 degrees; thus squirrels were more likely to choose Tree 1 even when doing so required running at least partly toward the approaching threat. The decisions made by focal squirrels provide evidence that this species' assessment of risk is highly nuanced. A great deal of variation has been reported in responses to predators within species. While part of the variation may be due to strategic unpredictability on the part of the prey, part of it may also be due to differences in flight trajectory and refuge preferences that have not been well-studied.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  3     Total Times Cited:  3     Cited Reference Count:  48 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.3389/fevo.2019.00066     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),fight initiation;flight trajectory;refuge;escape angle;squirrels;INITIATION DISTANCE;ESCAPE DECISIONS;RISK-ASSESSMENT;PREDATOR BEHAVIOR;LIFE-HISTORY;REFUGE;RESPONSES;DIRECTION;URBAN;PREY;Sciuridae,,

Alternatively, according to evolutionary game theory models, nonterritorial males should settle in the vicinity of high-quality sites and 'choose' to delay breeding until these habitats are vacant for them ('male player' hypothesis). However, nonterritorial male spatial distribution has not been experimentally tested. If the defeated male hypothesis is true (1) deterioration of high-quality sites should increase the number of nonterritorial males in a population and (2) vacated low-quality territories should be taken over by new territorial males. If the male player hypothesis is true, a similar manipulation should (1) decrease the number of nonterritorial males and (2) vacated low-quality territories should not be taken over. We performed two types of field experiment to test these hypotheses: male removal and patch quality manipulation. Our study species was the territorial damselfly Calopteryx splendens; males of this species exhibit both territorial and nonterritorial behaviour. Our results suggest that deterioration of highquality habitats significantly reduced the number of nonterritorial males. The proportion of take-overs of the high-quality territories was significantly higher than that of low-quality territories. Our study supports the assumptions of the male player hypothesis and indicates that nonterritorial damselflies are more sensitive to habitat quality changes than territorial ones. Because nonterritorial individuals exist in most populations of territorial taxa, a better understanding of their settlement rules may be relevant for population dynamics and modelling.

New method: The utility of a robotically controlled laser for use in a predator-prey-like (PPL) paradigm was explored for use in rats. This involved the construction of a robotic two-dimensional gimbal to dynamically position a laser beam in a behavioral test chamber. Custom software was used to control the trajectory and final laser position in response to user input on a console. The software also detected the location of the laser beam and the rodent continuously so that the dynamics of the distance between them could be analyzed. When the animal or laser beam came within a fixed distance the animal would either be rewarded with electrical brain stimulation or shocked subcutaneously.        Results: Animals that received rewarding electrical brain stimulation could learn to chase the laser beam, while animals that received aversive subcutaneous shock learned to actively avoid the laser beam in the PPL paradigm. Mathematical computations are presented which describe the dynamic interaction of the laser and rodent.        Comparison with existing methods: The robotic laser offers a neutral stimulus to train rodents in an open field and is the first device to be versatile enough to assess distance between predator and prey in real time.        Conclusions: With ongoing behavioral testing this tool will permit the neurobiological investigation of predator/prey-like relationships in rodents, and may have future implications for prosthetic limb development through brain-machine interfaces.

The cumulative effects of disturbances may negatively affect caribou habitat use, survival, and population dynamics. Thus, there is a need to evaluate the impact of various human disturbances, especially those that cause direct mortality (e.g., sport hunting). We evaluated the relative importance of caribou and hunter habitat selection and landscape characteristics on caribou vulnerability to sport hunting in northern Quebec, Canada. We used resource selection functions to describe habitat selection of 223 caribou and 87 hunters. We then characterized >169,000 caribou harvest sites recorded over 17 years according to the relative probability of co-occurrence of caribou and hunters, the relative probability of occurrence of hunters only, or the characteristics of the landscape (e.g., distance to human infrastructures, elevation, land cover type). Landscape characteristics better explained caribou vulnerability to sport hunting than habitat selection of caribou and hunters, or their co-occurrence. Caribou were more vulnerable in proximity to hunting infrastructures (e.g., roads, outfitter camps) than elsewhere, but caribou strongly avoided roads. Caribou were also more vulnerable on frozen lakes than in other land cover types. Lakes were, however, avoided by caribou and not selected by hunters. Harvest was more likely in smoother terrain, even if caribou and hunters did not select for this characteristic. We demonstrated caribou were more vulnerable in areas with good accessibility (near roads) or where caribou were easily detectable (lakes, smoother terrain), which also represents areas that were either avoided or not selected by caribou or hunters. This discrepancy between harvest distribution and behaviors of caribou and hunters suggests that harvest may be an opportunistic event where visibility and accessibility increased chances of success for hunters. Managers could use this information to manipulate hunting success according to population estimates and harvest quota by establishing minimal distance to risky areas within which hunting would be prohibited. (c) 2016 The Wildlife Society.        We demonstrated that accessibility to the hunting areas, mainly defined by roads and outfitter camps, and visibility are the main factors increasing caribou vulnerability to sport hunting. We recommend that future studies on cumulative impacts consider roads as a human disturbance causing avoidance and as a potential source of mortality due to the increase in accessibility for hunters.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  12     Total Times Cited:  13     Cited Reference Count:  60 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1002/jwmg.21203     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),game species vulnerability;human disturbances;northern Quebec;Rangifer tarandus;resource selection functions;sport hunting;WHITE-TAILED DEER;PREDATION RISK;HABITAT SELECTION;ROE DEER;SPACE-USE;BEHAVIORAL-RESPONSE;RESOURCE SELECTION;WOODLAND CARIBOU;ROADS;ELK;Sports,,

Experience allows offspring to modify responses to specific threats and also leaves them vulnerable during the learning period. However, antipredator behaviors used at one stage of a predator encounter may compensate for deficiencies at another stage, a phenomenon that may reduce the overall risk of young that are vulnerable at one or more stages. Few studies have examined age differences in the effectiveness of antipredator behaviors across multiple stages of a predator encounter. In this study, we examined age differences in the antipredator behaviors of California ground squirrels (Otospermophilus beecheyi) during the detection, interaction, and attack stages of Pacific rattlesnake (Crotalus oreganus) encounters. Using free-ranging squirrels, we examined the ability to detect free-ranging rattlesnakes, snake-directed behaviors after discovery of a snake, and responses to simulated rattlesnake strikes. We found that age was the most important factor in snake detection, with adults being more likely to detect snakes than pups. We also found that adults performed more tail flagging (a predator-deterrent signal) toward snakes and were more likely to investigate a snake's refuge when interacting with a hidden snake. In field experiments simulating snake strikes, adults exhibited faster reaction times than pups. Our results show that snake detection improves with age and that pups probably avoid rattlesnakes and minimize time spent in close proximity to them to compensate for their reduced reaction times to strikes.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  17     Total Times Cited:  17     Cited Reference Count:  70 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s00265-015-1957-2     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Antipredator;Experience;Development;Ontogeny;Pursuit-deterrent signal;Snake;SPERMOPHILUS-BEECHEYI;ALARM-CALL;PREDATOR FACILITATION;TIMBER RATTLESNAKES;FORAGING BEHAVIOR;TAIL;ADULT;VIGILANCE;RESPONSES;JUVENILE;California,,

One of the greatest changes brought by urbanization has been an increase in anthropogenic noise, with negative consequences for the natural behavior of animals. Small mammals are particularly vulnerable to urbanization and noise, despite some species having successfully occupied urban environments. To understand some of the traits that have enabled small mammals to deal with the consequences of urbanization, we compared the behavioral responses of urban and rural greater white-toothed shrews, Crocidura russula, to different sound stimuli. A total of 32 shrews, 16 from each habitat, were exposed in captivity to four sound treatments: silence, tawny owl calls, traffic noise, and white noise. Urban and rural shrews showed different behaviors, with urban animals being more active, feeding more frequently, and using less torpor than rural individuals. However, responses to sound treatments were similar in both populations: urban and rural shrews exhibited a slight decrease in activity and feeding behavior, as well as more fleeing responses, when exposed to traffic noise or white noise, but not to owl calls. These results suggest urbanization induces long-term changes in the general activity of C. russula, but the short-term behavioral response to sound disturbance remains similar in rural and urban populations.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  2     Total Times Cited:  2     Cited Reference Count:  78 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s11252-020-01079-y     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Heterothermy index;Nocturnal activity;Risk perception;Soricidae;Urbanization;Urban noise;NOISE EXPOSURE;TRAFFIC NOISE;SMALL MAMMALS;DAILY TORPOR;URBANIZATION;HABITUATION;PREDATION;WILDLIFE;IMPACTS;BATS,,

Territoriality imposes spatial structure on social interactions: if spatial heterogeneity in habitat quality leads to clustering of high- and low-quality territories, and if consistently more aggressive individuals are more likely to obtain higher-quality territories, the resulting clusters of territory holders of similar aggression are likely to influence a wide array of social dynamics in territorial species, particularly when aggressive behaviour is consistently associated with variation in other behaviours, such as boldness. Using 8 years of historical nesting data in a northeastern population of song sparrows, we here determine (1) whether historical nesting success (defined both as clutch size and survival) is spatially clustered; and (2) whether aggression or boldness in first-year territorial males is correlated with the historical clutch size or nest survival of each male's territory. We found significant clustering of both predation risk and large clutch sizes, even when controlling for the identities of historical territory owners. The aggressive behaviour of new territorial males was correlated with historical clutch size, but not with historical nest survival; in contrast, boldness was not correlated with either historical clutch size or nest survival. Thus, spatial variation in habitat quality is correlated with territorial aggression, but territory holders may either prioritize or be unable to assess all variables contributing to territory quality. In addition, a boldness-aggression syndrome does not necessarily result in both behaviours covarying with territory quality. (C) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

In many studies, the impact of human activities on wildlife is assessed through census counts, i.e. by estimating population sizes or densities, but also the social organisation of gregarious species can be affected. Using seven species of ungulates occurring in the Akagera Ecosystem, we compared grouping patterns (i.e. group sizes and compositions) of different group types (e.g. bachelor, all-female and mixed-sex groups) between sites situated inside a protected area, i.e. Lake Mburo National Park in Uganda and the adjacent Ankole Ranching Scheme (ARS), an unprotected area with intense human pursuit. Differences in group sizes were detectible in only a few cases, e.g. bachelor group size in common eland Tragelaphus oryx pattersonianus increased in the ARS, which may be advantageous due to increased vigilance. However, we found pronounced differences in group compositions in numerous species and for different group types, for example, in eland and waterbuck Kobus ellipsiprymnus defassa (i.e. in all group types), and topi Damaliscus lunatus jimela, oribi Ourebia ourebi and warthog Phacochoerus aetiopicus (all-female and mixed-sex groups). We discuss that continuous monitoring of grouping patterns of these (and other) species may be a valuable approach to detect 'subtle' effects of human nuisance even before an overall population decline can be observed.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  8     Total Times Cited:  9     Cited Reference Count:  87 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.2981/11-025     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),African ungulates;domestic livestock;game ranching;poaching;social organisation;Akagera Ecosystem;VIGILANCE BEHAVIOR;HABITAT SELECTION;AGE-DETERMINATION;PREDATION;COMPETITION;LIONS;RISK;SEX;CONSERVATION;DEMOGRAPHY;Humans;Humanities;Humanism,,

While many studies have linked migratory ungulate declines to migration disruption or loss, very few have explored the underlying factors that determine whether a population perishes or persists. In some cases, populations undergo severe declines and extirpation after migration loss; however, others appear able to persist as residents. We predict that to persist, populations must replace the traditional benefits of migration by altering the foraging strategies they employ as residents within one seasonal range. We propose the alternative foraging strategies (AFS) hypothesis as a framework for identifying various behavioral strategies that populations may use to cope with migration loss. We tested the hypothesis using the formerly migratory Teton bighorn sheep population in northwest Wyoming, which ceased migrating over 60 yr ago, but has persisted as a resident population. We used global positioning system data to evaluate winter and summer habitat selection and seasonal elevational movements for 28 adult female bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) from 2008 to 2010. Resource selection functions revealed that bighorn sheep employ winter foraging strategies to survive as residents by seeking out rugged, high-elevation, windswept ridgelines. Seasonal movement analyses indicated that bighorn sheep undergo a newly documented ""abbreviated migration"" strategy that is closely synchronized with vegetation green-up patterns within their one range. Bighorn sheep descend 500 m in elevation and travel up to 10 km in spring, gaining access to newly emergent forage approximately 30 d before it appears on their high-elevation winter and summer ranges. Our findings indicate that the Teton bighorn sheep population has persisted due to its habitat selection, AFS, and unique movement patterns, which allow migration loss to be mediated to some extent. The identification of AFS and the habitats that support them can help reveal the underlying benefits of migration and conserve populations in the face of future migration loss.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  14     Total Times Cited:  14     Cited Reference Count:  61 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1002/ecs2.1855     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),abbreviated migration;alpine;alternative foraging strategies;bighorn sheep;Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem;habitat selection;migration;normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI);Ovis canadensis;phenology;ungulate;Wyoming;BIGHORN SHEEP;HABITAT SELECTION;LARGE HERBIVORES;REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS;TEMPERATE UNGULATE;AUTUMN NUTRITION;PREDATION RISK;MULE DEER;ELK HERD;POPULATIONS;Mountaineering,,

Optimality of a diet could vary based on the age, sex, size, predation risk, or foraging experience of the predator. This study tested the effects of a predator's age and foraging experience by observing prey capture attempts and success rate, and by calculating diet profitability for adult and neonate Sceloporus jarrovii and adult Sceloporus virgatus. Prey availability was assessed in order to determine prey preference and profitability. Neonates showed an increased number of prey capture attempts, but success rate was similar for neonates and adults of both species. Total diet profitability of neonates was lower than adults of either species, which could be a result of poor prey choice or gape limitation (although body size showed no direct effect). Overall, the diets of all three groups were less profitable than would be expected based on the types of prey in the environment, although this is likely due to low availability (from the lizard's perspective) of highly profitable items.

We studied how the escape behaviour of tree lizards (Urosaurus ornatus) varied across a disturbance gradient. We also considered how sex, body temperature, and perch temperature affected their escape decisions. Both sexes exhibited similar response patterns; however, lizards in the most-disturbed habitat, as well as cooler (body or perch temperature) lizards, initiated escape earlier (but did not flee further) than other animals. Increased wariness as indicated by earlier escape suggests that frequently-disturbed, more-open localities may be stressful habitats for species like U. ornatus. In addition, because cooler temperatures limit locomotor performance capacity, escape decisions should also depend on a species' thermal ecology. Overall, we stress the importance of multi-population approaches for capturing the variety of ways species adaptively respond to the threat of predation across habitat gradients.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  2     Total Times Cited:  2     Cited Reference Count:  77 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1163/1568539X-00003586     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),antipredator behaviour;habitat heterogeneity;optimal escape theory;prescribed fire;thermal ecology;Urosaurus ornatus;FLIGHT-INITIATION DISTANCE;PREDATION RISK-FACTORS;ANTIPREDATOR BEHAVIOR;SCELOPORUS-VIRGATUS;REFUGE USE;PERFORMANCE;DIRECTION;RESPONSES;COSTS;SEX;Lizards;Temperature,,

Self-organizing map (SOM) trained with parameters revealed that stop duration, stop number, and x- and y-coordinates played major roles in determining variations in movement. Behavior patterns (e.g., rightward movement to food) were identifiable in different clusters in association with parameters responding to sources and order of stimuli. Distribution shapes obtained from the SOM were suitable for identifying responses of test organisms. Acceleration intermittency in movement data in different distribution shapes addressed data structure variation caused by sources and order of stimuli. The order of stimuli was influential in determining the behavioral states in the following courses of stimulus provision (i.e., addition of secondary stimulus and removal of the initial stimulus).

Few studies have, however, examined whether the human hippocampus plays a similar role. We developed a novel decision-making paradigm to examine neural activity when participants made approach/avoidance decisions under conditions of high or absent approach-avoidance conflict. Critically, our task required participants to learn the associated reward/punishment values of previously neutral stimuli and controlled for mnemonic and spatial processing demands, both important issues given approach-avoidance behavior in humans is less tied to predation and foraging compared to rodents. Participants played a points-based game where they first attempted to maximize their score by determining which of a series of previously neutral image pairs should be approached or avoided. During functional magnetic resonance imaging, participants were then presented with novel pairings of these images. These pairings consisted of images of congruent or opposing learned valences, the latter creating conditions of high approach-avoidance conflict. A data-driven partial least squares multivariate analysis revealed two reliable patterns of activity, each revealing differential activity in the anterior hippocampus, the homolog of the rodent ventral hippocampus. The first was associated with greater hippocampal involvement during trials with high as opposed to no approach-avoidance conflict, regardless of approach or avoidance behavior. The second pattern encompassed greater hippocampal activity in a more anterior aspect during approach compared to avoid responses, for conflict and no-conflict conditions. Multivoxel pattern classification analyses yielded converging findings, underlining a role of the anterior hippocampus in approach-avoidance conflict decision making.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  49     Total Times Cited:  49     Cited Reference Count:  46 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1915-15.2015     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),approach-avoidance conflict;decision making;functional magnetic resonance imaging;hippocampus;memory;PARTIAL LEAST-SQUARES;POSTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX;MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX;VENTRAL HIPPOCAMPUS;FEAR EXPRESSION;SPATIAL MEMORY;ANXIETY;LESIONS;MECHANISMS;SYSTEMS;Humanities;Humanism;Humans;Hippocampus;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Decision Making,,

Vigilance can involve either scanning for predators (antipredator vigilance) or watching conspecifics (social vigilance). From observations of marked Gunnison's prairie dogs, Cynomys gunnisoni (Sciuridae), living under natural conditions at Valles Caldera National Preserve, New Mexico, U.S.A., we compared results from the two most common sampling methods used by behavioural ecologists to measure vigilance: focal sampling (i.e. observing an individual for a specific amount of time and recording the amount of time spent vigilant) and scan sampling (i.e. observing all individuals in an area at a single moment and recording whether each individual at that moment is vigilant or nonvigilant). Information from different individuals and from the same individuals over time both revealed that estimates of vigilance from scan sampling were consistently and significantly higher than estimates from focal sampling. These differences probably resulted because nonvigilant behaviours were more difficult to detect in scan samples than in focal samples. Our results have important implications for behavioural ecologists who want to make intraspecific or interspecific comparisons of vigilance.

In this paper, we examine a host-parasite model with an additional predator and show that the predator changes the evolutionary behaviour of the host. We find that the hosts maximize their levels of resistance at intermediate predation rates, where the cost of infection and the risk of exposure to disease are both high. We show that this effect is heightened when parasites are highly virulent and when there is strong selective predation. We also show that the potential for evolutionary branching increases with the predation rate for regions where the susceptible and infected hosts coexist with the predator. Hence, our results reveal that there are considerable impacts of adding predators to a population. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Since their foraging behavior and acoustics differ among populations ('ecotypes'), we hypothesized that other cetaceans can eavesdrop on KW sounds and adjust their behavior according to the KW ecotype. We performed playback experiments on long-finned pilot whales (Globicephala melas) in Norway using familiar fish-eating KW sounds (fKW) simulating a sympatric population that might compete for foraging areas, unfamiliar mammal-eating KW sounds (mKW) simulating a potential predator threat, and two control sounds. We assessed behavioral responses using animal-borne multi-sensor tags and surface visual observations. Pilot whales barely changed behavior to a broadband noise (CTRL-), whereas they were attracted and exhibited spyhops to fKW, mKW, and to a repeated-tonal upsweep signal (CTRL+). Whales never stopped nor started feeding in response to fKW, whereas they reduced or stopped foraging to mKW and CTRL+. Moreover, pilot whales joined other subgroups in response to fKW and CTRL+, whereas they tightened individual spacing within group and reduced time at surface in response to mKW. Typical active intimidation behavior displayed to fKW might be an antipredator strategy to a known low-risk ecotype or alternatively a way of securing the habitat exploited by a heterospecific sympatric population. Cessation of feeding and more cohesive approach to mKW playbacks might reflect an antipredator behavior towards an unknown KW ecotype of potentially higher risk. We conclude that pilot whales are able to acoustically discriminate between familiar and unfamiliar KW ecotypes, enabling them to adjust their behavior according to the perceived disturbance type.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  5     Total Times Cited:  5     Cited Reference Count:  100 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s10071-019-01282-1     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Globicephala melas;Acoustic playbacks;Killer whale ecotypes;Heterospecific sound discrimination;Multi-sensor tags;Cetacean behavioral responses;ORCINUS-ORCA;GLOBICEPHALA-MELAS;MARINE MAMMALS;FORAGING BEHAVIOR;ALARM CALLS;ACOUSTIC BEHAVIOR;HUMPBACK WHALE;PREDATION RISK;RESPONSES;ECHOLOCATION;Discrimination (Psychology),,

Understanding individual variation in venom resistance is key to unlocking basic mechanisms by which antagonistic coevolution can sustain variation in traits under selection. For prey, the opposing challenges of predator avoidance and resource acquisition often lead to correlated levels of risk and reward, which in turn can favor suites of integrated morphological, physiological and behavioral traits. We investigate the relationship between risk-sensitive behaviors, physiological resistance to rattlesnake venom, and stress in a population of California ground squirrels. For the same individuals, we quantified foraging decisions in the presence of snake predators, fecal corticosterone metabolites (a measure of ""stress""), and blood serum inhibition of venom enzymatic activity (a measure of venom resistance). Individual responses to snakes were repeatable for three measures of risk-sensitive behavior, indicating that some individuals were consistently risk-averse whereas others were risk tolerant. Venom resistance was lower in squirrels with higher glucocorticoid levels and poorer body condition. Whereas resistance failed to predict proximity to and interactions with snake predators, individuals with higher glucocorticoid levels and in lower body condition waited the longest to feed when near a snake. We compared alternative structural equation models to evaluate alternative hypotheses for the relationships among stress, venom resistance, and behavior. We found support for stress as a shared physiological correlate that independently lowers venom resistance and leads to squirrels that wait longer to feed in the presence of a snake, whereas we did not find evidence that resistance directly facilitates latency to forage. Our findings suggest that stress may help less-resistant squirrels avoid a deadly snakebite, but also reduces feeding opportunities. The combined lethal and non-lethal effects of stressors in predator-prey interactions simultaneously impact multiple key traits in this system, making environmental stress a potential contributor to geographic variation in trait expression of toxic predators and resistant prey.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  4     Total Times Cited:  4     Cited Reference Count:  102 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.3390/toxins12100617     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),"antipredator defense;boldness;integrated phenotype;trade-offs;Otospermophilis beecheyi;Crotalus o;oreganus;SPERMOPHILUS-BEECHEYI;PHENOTYPIC INTEGRATION;ANTIPREDATOR BEHAVIOR;OTOSPERMOPHILUS-BEECHEYI;CORRELATIONAL SELECTION;ANIMAL PERSONALITY;ANTISNAKE DEFENSES;AGE-DIFFERENCES;GARTER SNAKE;PREDATOR;Stress, Physiological;Crotalid Venoms;California;Venoms",,

The primary objective was to quantify survivorship of yellow perch yolk-sac fry exposed to two different temperature declines (4 and 8 degrees C) and compare survivorship to that of perch fry under ambient temperatures representative of natural conditions. Behaviour of yolk-sac fry following temperature declines was also qualitatively assessed. Mean survival in the control, 4, and 8 treatment tanks was 90, 91 and 97%, respectively, and no significant differences in percent survival were observed between the control and the 4 treatment (ts=0.10; df=7; P=0.93), the control and 8 treatment (ts=1.85; df=7; P=0.11) or the 4 and 8 treatments (ts=1.33; df=7; P=0.22). Observations of yellow perch eggs and fry behaviour following temperature declines differed among treatments. Any remaining eggs in the control treatment and 4 treatments continued to hatch during the experiment, and fry were documented swimming throughout the water column in all tanks. However, in the 8 treatment, any eggs that had not hatched remained inactive and all fry within all 8 treatment tanks ceased swimming activity and settled to the bottom of the tanks once the temperature reached 3.9 degrees C. Fry remained at the bottom of the tanks for the entire 48h simulated cold-front. Fry resumed swimming activity once water temperatures began to increase (by approximately 6 degrees C). Results indicated that drops in temperature (i.e. cold fronts) similar to or greater than those found in small impoundments did not cause direct mortality of yellow perch during the yolk-sac fry (post-hatch larvae) stage. Although an acute drop in temperature may not induce sudden high mortality, it may be a sub-lethal stressor, leading to increased starvation or predation risk.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  7     Total Times Cited:  7     Cited Reference Count:  25 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/jai.12115     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),SOUTH-DAKOTA;CLIMATOLOGICAL VARIABLES;TEMPERATURE;POPULATION;DYNAMICS;LARVAE;LAKE;ABUNDANCE;GROWTH;Cold Temperature,,

However, it is unknown to what extent tadpoles can induce such behavioral and morphological plasticity in response to introduced predators. Lowland Leopard Frogs (Rana yavapaiensis) are native to Arizona and are currently declining because of a variety of factors including introduced predators such as the Green Sunfish (Lepomis cyanellus). We reared Lowland Leopard Frog tadpoles in the presence of tadpole-fed Green Sunfish or in control tanks and tested whether Lowland Leopard Frog tadpoles alter their behaviors or body shape in response to the visual and chemical cues of this predator. We found that tadpoles reared in the presence of Green Sunfish were 90% less active and had significantly different body shapes (including 5% deeper tail fins, 3% larger tail muscle height, and 3% smaller tail muscle area) than tadpoles reared in control tanks. In a subsequent survival experiment with sunfish predators, however, the survival rates did not differ between the two groups of tadpoles. Thus, our results suggest that Lowland Leopard Frog tadpoles perceive Green Sunfish as potential predators, but the induced morphological changes and the experience of prior exposure do not confer a survival advantage.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  6     Total Times Cited:  6     Cited Reference Count:  47 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1670/08-081R1.1     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),INDUCED PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY;BEHAVIORAL-RESPONSES;CHEMICAL CUES;TAIL SHAPE;ALARM CUES;TADPOLES;PREDATORS;SELECTION;RISK;FISH,,

However, anthropogenic chemicals might interrupt this natural chemical information flow, with potential impacts on predator-prey interactions. Our goal was to explore how Buccaneer (R) Plus, a common herbicide similar to Round-up (R) (active ingredient glyphosate). affected the interactions between intraguild predators. The wolf spider Pardosa milvina (Hentz, 1844) is numerically dominant in agricultural systems across the eastern United States, and often falls prey to or competes with the larger wolf spider, Hogna helluo (Walckenaer, 1837) and/or the carabid beetle, Scarites quadriceps (Chaudoir, 1843). We tested the effects of chemical cues from these intraguild predators and exposure to herbicide on the activity, emigration, and survival of P. milvina using a full-factorial laboratory experiment. Both predator cues and herbicide led to a decrease in movement by P. milvina. However, although H. helluo cues alone decreased movement, S. quadriceps cues only decreased movement when combined with herbicide. These results indicate that predation risk and herbicide application likely interact in complex ways to affect the movement of a major arthropod predator in agricultural systems, and thus may have complex effects on the food web.

To examine acoustic differences in relation to these variables, we extracted a suite of acoustic parameters from digitized calls and applied discriminant function analyses. The barks constitute a graded continuum, ranging from a tonal, harmonically rich call into a call with a more noisy, harsh structure. Tonal barks are typically given when the signaler is at risk of losing contact with the group or when a mother and infant have become separated (contact barks). The harsher variants are given in response to large predators (alarm barks). However, there are also intermediate forms between the two subtypes which may occur in both situations. This finding is not due to an overlap of individuals' distinct distributions but can be replicated within individuals. Within the alarm bark category, there are significant differences between calls given in response to mammalian carnivores and those given in response to crocodiles. Again, there are intermediate variants. Both alarm call types are equally different from contact barks, indicating that the calls vary along different dimensions. Finally, there are consistent, significant differences among different individuals' calls. However, individual identity in one call type cannot directly be inferred from knowledge of the individuals' call characteristics in the other. In sum, the barks of female baboons potentially provide rich information to the recipients of these signals. The extent to which baboons discriminate between alarm and contact barks, and classify calls according to context and/or acoustic similarity will be described in a subsequent paper.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  120     Total Times Cited:  120     Cited Reference Count:  60 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1046/j.1439-0310.2001.00630.x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),CALIFORNIA GROUND-SQUIRRELS;MACAQUES MACACA-SYLVANUS;BARBARY MACAQUES;ALARM CALLS;SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS;NONHUMAN-PRIMATES;VOCAL REPERTOIRE;VOCALIZATIONS;BEHAVIOR;SIGNALS;Papio,,

Hermit crabs were buried at varying depths (2, 4, and 6 cm), and in two orientations (shell aperture up and aperture down). Hermit crab weight, shell weight, shell shape, aperture orientation, and depth of burial were analyzed to determine their influence on shell abandonment and survival. We found a significant number of hermit crabs that abandoned their shells when compared with the control group. Aperture orientation strongly influenced shell abandonment, with 73.2% of hermit crabs that abandoned their shells doing so from an aperture up position. None of the other variables significantly affected shell abandonment behavior. However, shell weight, shell abandonment, aperture orientation, and depth of burial were all found to be significant factors in the survival of P. samuelis when buried. Although abandoning the shell significantly increases the chances of surviving a sedimentation event, such as flooding, this behavior likely puts the crab at increased risk of both predation and being buried in a subsequent event if flooding persists in the short term. Hermit crabs are underrepresented in the fossil record. Especially rare are in situ specimens. We suggest one possible reason for this paucity is that, whether the hermit crab survives the burial event or not, if it abandons the shell, the body and shell are less likely to be found fossilized together.

However, human-modified habitat can be a source of both increased risk and increased food availability, particularly for large carnivores. Assessing preferential use of the landscape is important for managing wildlife and can be particularly useful in transitional habitats, such as at the wildland-urban interface. Preferential use is often evaluated using resource selection functions (RSFs), which are focused on quantifying habitat preference using either a temporally static framework or researcher-defined temporal delineations. Many applications of RSFs do not incorporate time-varying landscape availability or temporally-varying behavior, which may mask conflict and avoidance behavior.MethodsContemporary approaches to incorporate landscape availability into the assessment of habitat selection include spatio-temporal point process models, step selection functions, and continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) models; in contrast with the other methods, the CTMC model allows for explicit inference on animal movement in continuous-time. We used a hierarchical version of the CTMC framework to model speed and directionality of fine-scale movement by a population of cougars inhabiting the Front Range of Colorado, U.S.A., an area exhibiting rapid population growth and increased recreational use, as a function of individual variation and time-varying responses to landscape covariates.ResultsWe found evidence for individual- and daily temporal-variability in cougar response to landscape characteristics. Distance to nearest kill site emerged as the most important driver of movement at a population-level. We also detected seasonal differences in average response to elevation, heat loading, and distance to roads. Motility was also a function of amount of development, with cougars moving faster in developed areas than in undeveloped areas.ConclusionsThe time-varying framework allowed us to detect temporal variability that would be masked in a generalized linear model, and improved the within-sample predictive ability of the model. The high degree of individual variation suggests that, if agencies want to minimize human-wildlife conflict management options should be varied and flexible. However, due to the effect of recursive behavior on cougar movement, likely related to the location and timing of potential kill-sites, kill-site identification tools may be useful for identifying areas of potential conflict.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  11     Total Times Cited:  11     Cited Reference Count:  76 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1186/s40462-018-0140-6     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Animal movement;Hierarchical model;Individual variation;Population-level;Predation;Telemetry;Wildland-urban interface;ANIMAL MOVEMENT;HABITAT-SELECTION;RESOURCE SELECTION;MOUNTAIN LION;SPATIAL MEMORY;SPACE MODELS;HOME-RANGE;PATTERNS;LANDSCAPE;CONSTRAINTS,,

Decoration occurs frequently in some taxa but infrequently in others. Some data indicate that decoration is a morphologically flexible phenotype that facilitates feeding and/or protects against biotic and abiotic forces. Yet decoration is not taxonomically ubiquitous. Other data suggest that decorating could be energetically costly.        Questions: How do feeding, energy expenditure, and mortality risk interact to exert selective pressure on decorating phenotypes? Could energetic costs associated with decorating theoretically limit the behaviour's selective advantage and account for its patchy taxonomic distribution?        Methods: Build a model of decoration's effect on reproductive potential using energy intake, energy expenditure, and mortality risk as parameters. Analytically find the upper bound of permissible energetic costs. From existing literature, estimate parameter values for energetics, reproduction, and mortality of the green sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis, and analyse them using graphical and numerical methods to determine the probable influence of energy cost on decoration in this animal.        Conclusions: Physiologically realistic energetic costs can constrain the parameter space in which decorating is selectively advantageous. This appears to be true even for costs far below the theoretical upper limit. Thus the evolution of decoration should be more sensitive to energetic costs than to the other parameters that we modelled. Sensitivity to energetic costs may explain (at least in part) decoration's patchy taxonomic distribution.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  27     Total Times Cited:  29     Cited Reference Count:  80 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",,camouflage;covering;defence;ornamentation;masking;predation;reproductive potential;selection;GREEN SEA-URCHIN;DIOPATRA-CUPREA BOSC;STRONGYLOCENTROTUS-DROEBACHIENSIS;COVERING BEHAVIOR;PARACENTROTUS-LIVIDUS;CADDIS LARVAE;ANTIPREDATORY DEVICES;FOOD AVAILABILITY;PREY SPECIFICITY;MAJIDAE,,

Yet, few studies have considered how they are mediated due to substantial challenges in quantifying behavior over appropriate temporal and spatial scales. Here, we employ high-resolution sonar imaging to track the motion and interactions among predatory fish and their schooling prey in a natural environment. In particular, we address the relationship between predator attack behavior and the capacity for prey to respond both directly and through collective propagation of changes in velocity by group members [2-6]. To do so, we investigated a large number of attacks and estimated per capita risk during attack and its relation to the size, shape, and internal structure of prey groups. Predators were found to frequently form coordinated hunting groups, with up to five individuals attacking in line formation. Attacks were associated with increased fragmentation and irregularities in the spatial structure of prey groups, features that inhibit collective information transfer among prey. Prey group fragmentation, likely facilitated by predator line formation, increased (estimated) per capita risk of prey, provided prey schools were maintained below a threshold size of approximately 2 m(2). Our results highlight the importance of collective behavior to the strategies employed by both predators and prey under conditions of considerable informational constraints.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  148     Total Times Cited:  151     Cited Reference Count:  30 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.cub.2012.04.050     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),GROUP-SIZE;STARLING FLOCKS;PREDATION RISK;MARINE INSECT;BEHAVIOR;FISH;DILUTION;AVOIDANCE;DISTANCE;SHOALS,,

We develop a state-dependent, dynamic game model(6) of foraging by a pair of animals, in which each individual chooses between resting or foraging during a series of consecutive periods, so as to maximize its own individual chances of survival(6,7). We find that, if there is an advantage to foraging together(1,2,8), the equilibrium behaviour of both individuals becomes highly synchronized. As a result of this synchronization, differences in the energetic reserves of the two players spontaneously develop, leading them to adopt different behavioural roles. The individual with lower reserves emerges as the 'pace-maker' who determines when the pair should forage, providing a straightforward resolution to the problem of group coordination. Moreover, the strategy that gives rise to this behaviour can be implemented by a simple 'rule of thumb'(9) that requires no detailed knowledge of the state of other individuals.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  230     Total Times Cited:  232     Cited Reference Count:  30 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1038/nature01630     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),DECISION-MAKING;PREDATION;RISK;BEHAVIOR;SEGREGATION;STRATEGIES;POSITION;RUTILUS;MODEL,,

Therefore, understanding the mechanisms shaping vigilance behavior provides relevant insights on factors influencing individual fitness. We investigated the role of extrinsic and intrinsic factors on vigilance behavior in Mediterranean mouflon (Ovis gmelini musimonxOvis sp.) in a study site spatially and temporally contrasted in human pressures. Both sexes were less vigilant in the wildlife reserve compared to surrounding unprotected areas, except for males during the hunting period. During this period, males tended to be less strictly restricted to the reserve than females what might lead to a pervasive effect of hunting within the protected area, resulting in an increase in male vigilance. It might also be a rutting effect that did not occur in unprotected areas because males vigilance was already maximal in response to human disturbances. In both sexes, yearlings were less vigilant than adults, probably because they traded off vigilance for learning and energy acquisition and/or because they relied on adult experience present in the group. Similarly, non-reproductive females benefited of the vigilance effort provided by reproductive females when belonging to the same group. However, in the absence of reproductive females, non-reproductive females were as vigilant as reproductive females. Increasing group size was only found to reduce vigilance in females (up to 17.5%), not in males. We also showed sex-specific responses to habitat characteristics. Females increased their vigilance when habitat visibility decreased (up to 13.8%) whereas males increased their vigilance when feeding on low quality sites, i.e., when concomitant increase in chewing time can be devoted to vigilance with limited costs. Our global approach was able to disentangle the sex-specific sources of variation in mouflon vigilance and stressed the importance of reserves in managing and conserving wild sheep populations.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  16     Total Times Cited:  17     Cited Reference Count:  83 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1371/journal.pone.0082960     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),PREDATION RISK;GROUP-SIZE;OVIS-GMELINI;BIGHORN SHEEP;BEHAVIOR;AGE;POPULATION;PREY;GAME;ELK;Humanities;Humanism;Humans;Social Environment,,

We first establish the criteria for Hopf, Turing, double-Hopf, and Turing-Hopf bifurcations, and determine the stable and unstable regions of the positive equilibrium. For Turing-Hopf bifurcation, by analyzing the normal form truncated to the third order, we derive that, with strong nonlocal interaction, the system exhibits the tristable phenomena, that is, the coexistence of a stable spatially nonhomogeneous periodic orbit and two nonconstant stable steady states, as well as the existence of periodic orbits with two spatial wave frequencies induced by the nonlocal interaction. The main analytical difficulty arises from the nonlocal interaction that prevents the direct application of formulas for the coefficients of the normal form. Biologically, the emerging spatiotemporal patterns suggest that the global intraspecific competition can promote the coexistence of the prey and predator by allowing the prey maintain a critical total population size, which may provide an alternative approach in explaining the group formation of some prey species under the risk of predation. Some coexistence patterns are destabilized by introducing another prey species with local intraspecific competition, leading to the coexistence of two preys and one predator, namely, the prey with nonlocal interaction is concentrated at a single spatial location, and the other prey is distributed uniformly in the rest of the habitat. Accordingly, the predator is forced to change its behavior as well.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  4     Total Times Cited:  4     Cited Reference Count:  31 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/sapm.12444     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),nonlocal predator-prey model;normal form;spatiotemporal pattern;Turing-Hopf bifurcation;HOPF-BIFURCATION;MODEL;DYNAMICS;STABILITY;EQUATIONS;Prednisolone,,

Behavioral syndromes, on the other hand, appear as consistent individual variation in behavior that is both repeatable for individuals within a functional context (e.g., consistent voracity toward prey) and correlated across contexts (e.g., high voracity toward prey and high levels of boldness toward enemies). Thus, adaptive plasticity and syndromes represent two extremes of a behavioral plasticity continuum upon which most behavioral phenotypes fall. We tested for both adaptive plasticity and behavioral syndromes in the western black widow spider, Latrodectus hesperus. We measured behavior in three contexts: startle, startle+prey, and startle+mate, and found (1) classic behaviorally plastic responses to predation risk, (2) high repeatability of behavior within contexts, and (3) evidence of a correlation between startle+prey and startle+mate contexts, indicative of a behavioral syndrome. As relative behavioral plasticity may vary across populations, we also compared urban and desert populations to test whether spiders from these habitats exhibit different behaviors and/or behavioral syndromes. While we found that urban males used in mating trials courted urban females significantly more than desert females, we found no other differences in the behavior of urban and desert black widows. Thus, black widows, regardless of habitat, are characterized by both context-specific behavioral plasticity and across-context correlations, presenting a phenotypic complexity that is likely exhibited, to varying degrees, by most organisms.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  12     Total Times Cited:  14     Cited Reference Count:  44 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/eth.12297     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),behavioral plasticity;behavioral syndromes;human-induced rapid environmental change;Latrodectus hesperus;LATRODECTUS-HESPERUS;PERSONALITY-TRAITS;SEXUAL CANNIBALISM;FISHING SPIDER;EVOLUTIONARY;POPULATIONS;CONSEQUENCES;PREDATION;BOLDNESS;BIOLOGY,,

In previous work, we found that pairs of stickleback fish prefer to synchronize their trips out of cover to look for food [5], possibly because this reduces perceived predation risk [6]. To create a degree of conflict over group coordination, we trained individual fish to expect food at one of two alternative, exposed locations and paired individuals with different expectations. Compared with isolated individuals, members of a pair showed a significantly increased tendency to alternate between foraging sites, together taking turns to visit first one individual's favored site and then the other individual's. Using a Markov-chain model to infer the individual rules underlying their joint behavior, we found that fish respond to a partner that breaks the pattern of alternation by themselves reverting to less regular behavior. Our results confirm theoretical predictions that conflict over group coordination can be resolved by taking turns [7-10] and show that, in this system, the pattern of alternation is actively monitored and maintained.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  35     Total Times Cited:  36     Cited Reference Count:  24 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.cub.2009.11.045     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),BEHAVIORAL SYNDROMES;GASTEROSTEUS-ACULEATUS;STICKLEBACK;LEADERSHIP;GAMES;EVOLUTION;ORIGINS,,

Although the mechanisms of how groups collectively make decisions have been extensively researched, the response of within-group dynamics to ecological conditions is virtually unknown, despite adaptation to the environment being a cornerstone in biology. We investigate how within-group interactions during exploration of a novel environment are shaped by predation, a major influence on the behavior of prey species. We tested guppies (Poecilia reticulata) from rivers varying in predation risk under controlled laboratory conditions and find the first evidence of differences in group interactions between animals adapted to different levels of predation. Fish from high-predation habitats showed the strongest negative relationship between initiating movements and following others, which resulted in less variability in the total number of movements made between individuals. This relationship between initiating movements and following others was associated with differentiation into initiators and followers, which was only observed in fish from high-predation rivers. The differentiation occurred rapidly, as trials lasted 5 min, and was related to shoal cohesion, where more diverse groups from high-predation habitats were more cohesive. Our results show that even within a single species over a small geographical range, decision-making in a social context can vary with local ecological factors.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  50     Total Times Cited:  50     Cited Reference Count:  60 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1126/sciadv.1602682     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),GUPPIES POECILIA-RETICULATA;ANIMAL GROUPS;BEHAVIOR;RISK;POPULATIONS;PERSONALITY;INDIVIDUALS;LEADERSHIP;SIZE;Prednisolone,,

Additionally, the selfish herd hypothesis was first put forward by Hamilton ( 1971). He proposed that in order to reduce its risk of predation, an individual should approach its nearest neighbor, reducing its risk at the expense of those around it. Despite extensive empirical support, the selfish herd hypothesis has been criticized on theoretical grounds: approaching the nearest neighbor does not result in the observed dense aggregations, and the nearest neighbor in space is not necessarily the one that can be reached fastest. Increasingly complex movement rules have been proposed, successfully producing dense aggregations of individuals. However, no study to date has made a full comparison of the different proposed movement rules within the same modeling environment. Further, ecologically relevant parameters, such as the size and density of a population or group and the time it takes a predator to attack, have thus far been ignored. Here, we investigate the reduction in risk for animals aggregating using different strategies and demonstrate the importance of ecological parameters on risk reduction in group-living animals. We find that complex rules are most successful at reducing risk in small, compact populations, whereas simpler rules are most successful in larger, low-density populations, and when predators attack quickly after being detected by their prey.

As wolf pups pass this entire period at either the den or rendezvous sites, their selection by wolf packs may affect pup survival and recruitment. Rendezvous sites are important for pup survival as they are used during summer and early autumn, when intense human activity may increase pup mortality. Adult wolves and pups can be killed by livestock guarding dogs during summer and intentionally or accidentally during large game hunting in autumn. This study describes factors related to rendezvous site selection in order to enhance their protection and management. We studied the rendezvous site selection of 30 wolf packs in central and northern Greece between 1998 and 2010, after locating 35 sites using the simulated howling survey method and telemetry. We considered a series of environmental and anthropogenic predictors of wolf rendezvous site selection at two spatial scales. At the landscape-population scale, wolves selected rendezvous sites below 1,200 m asl, with large inter-site distance (mean, 12.9 km), and avoided partially forested or open habitats, indicating preference for covered, spaced areas with seasonally stable resources. At the home range scale, wolves selected rendezvous sites away from forest roads and villages, close to water sources, and in areas with low forest fragmentation, indicating avoidance of human presence and disturbance. In the summer of 2011, we used an ensuing resource selection model (RSF, AUC = 0.818) to successfully locate seven new rendezvous sites outside our previous survey area, verifying the utility of prediction maps (all new sites were at areas with 0.8-1 model probability). Rendezvous prediction maps can be used to reduce field effort when monitoring wolf populations, assess livestock predation risk, design protected areas, and reduce human disturbance on reproductive wolf packs.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  33     Total Times Cited:  34     Cited Reference Count:  63 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s10344-013-0746-3     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Wolf;Homesite;Rendezvous site;Human activity;Forest fragmentation;Prediction maps;WOLVES CANIS-LUPUS;CARIBOU;FOREST;DENS;TERRITORIES;DEPREDATION;DISTURBANCE;PARAMETERS;MOVEMENTS;BEHAVIOR;Greece,,

We examined sublethal effects of consecutive exposures of malathion, an organophosphate insecticide used for mosquito abatement, on the behavior of blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus). We measured righting time (i.e., time to return upright when placed upside down), eyestalk reflexes, foraging ability, and response to predation risk in three malathion treatments of 50 A mu g/L that varied in duration: (1) static exposure for 96 h followed by a second exposure for 96 h, (2) static exposure for 96 h followed by transfer to pesticide-free water for 96 h, (3) control without malathion for 192 h. Malathion significantly increased crabs' righting time 45 +/- 23%, but righting time was not different from controls after crabs were placed in malathion-free water for 96 h. Normal eyestalk reflexes significantly declined 50 +/- 15% in adults and 75 +/- 40% in juveniles. Malathion affected foraging ability; blue crabs sought food more frequently, even in the presence of alarm cues from injured crabs but were less able to locate food after malathion exposure. Thus malathion, at environmentally occurring concentrations, interfered with blue crabs' neuromuscular function, inhibited their ability to forage, and caused them to ignore predation risk when foraging. However, two exposures to malathion did not increase mortality nor further impair behavior, and behavior was not different than controls crabs when placed in seawater without insecticides for 96 h, suggesting sublethal impairment from malathion was reversible.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  4     Total Times Cited:  4     Cited Reference Count:  45 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s00244-018-0536-8     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),FOOD-CONSUMPTION;MALATHION;DIAZINON;GROWTH;ATRAZINE;LETHAL;Pesticides;Organophosphates,,

To determine when to produce defenses, prey collect information and evaluate the costs and benefits of defense induction. Resource availability can affect prey ability and willingness to incur defense costs. When resources are scarce, defenses may suffer disproportionate decreases in energy allocation if defenses would further reduce prey access to resources or if resources are needed to maintain metabolic functions. We tested the effects of predation risk and resource availability on plastic defenses in eastern oysters Crassostrea virginica and present novel findings that oysters continued to produce defended shells in response to predators when resourceswere limited, even though they grewsmaller, lighter shells when deprived of food in control conditions. Predation risk affected all three tested shellmetrics (area, weight, and strength), but food availability did not. Although low food levels often limit expression of predator defenses, predator cues caused oysters to build shells that were larger and heavier, with a similar trend for shell strength, in treatments with both low and high food levels, suggesting that predation is an important pressure in this system. The differences between predator and control treatments were greater under conditions of low food availability, and thus, resource availability may influence interpretations of plastic responses to predators.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  7     Total Times Cited:  7     Cited Reference Count:  69 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1086/695470     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),CHEMICAL ALARM CUES;FORAGING TRADE-OFFS;OCEAN ACIDIFICATION;PREY INTERACTIONS;INTERTIDAL GASTROPOD;INDUCIBLE DEFENSES;METABOLIC COST;CHESAPEAKE BAY;MARINE SNAIL;BEHAVIOR;Crassostrea;Prednisolone;Health Resources,,

In females, we found a general increase in copulation behaviour in when the sex ratio was female biased, but only large-brained females responded with greater willingness to copulate under a low predation threat. In males, we found that small-brained individuals courted more intensively and displayed more aggressive behaviours than large-brained individuals. However, there were no differences in female response to males with different brain size. These results provide further evidence of a role for female brain size in optimal decision-making in a mating context. In addition, our results indicate that brain size may affect mating display skill in male guppies.

We walked seven hiking trails (spanning a total of 33.9 km) in a high-elevation environment every 15 days from May to October in 2007-2009, and located all the groups of free-ranging ungulates within our study site. We analyzed the size variation in female groups with kids of Alpine chamois in relation to (i) forage availability (as estimated using the normalized difference vegetation index); (ii) distance from safe areas; (iii) presence of potential competitor species (i.e., mouflon); and (iv) environmental variables (elevation, slope exposure). We found that forage availability was one of the most important drivers of group size patterns. Larger groups were found in meadows with higher productivity, whereas smaller groups were located in lower quality meadows in sheltered areas, indicating how the female group size may be the outcome of both resource availability and predation risk avoidance. Interestingly, proximity of a mouflon group was able to modify the size of Alpine chamois female groups, especially if the nearest mouflon group was concurrently close and inclusive of a higher percentage of rams.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  4     Total Times Cited:  4     Cited Reference Count:  80 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1515/mammalia-2014-0011     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),forage quality;group size;Ovis gmelinii;Rupicapra rupicapra;shelter area;DEER CAPREOLUS-CAPREOLUS;EASTERN SOUTHERN ALPS;SOCIAL-ORGANIZATION;PREDATION RISK;BIGHORN SHEEP;MULTIMODEL INFERENCE;POPULATION-DYNAMICS;DEFENSIVE BEHAVIOR;TEMPORAL VARIATION;HABITAT SELECTION,,

Artificial night lighting threatens to disrupt strongly conserved light-dependent processes in animals and may have cascading effects on ecosystems as species interactions become altered. Insectivorous bats and their prey have been involved in a nocturnal, co-evolutionary arms race for millions of years. Lights may interfere with anti-bat defensive behaviours in moths, and disrupt a complex and globally ubiquitous interaction between bats and insects, ultimately leading to detrimental consequences for ecosystems on a global scale.        2. We combined experimental and mathematical approaches to determine effects of light pollution on a free-living bat-insect community. We compared prey selection by Cape serotine bats Neoromicia capensis in naturally unlit and artificially lit conditions using a manipulative field experiment, and developed a probabilistic model based on a suite of prey-selection factors to explain differences in observed diet.        3. Moth consumption by N. capensis was low under unlit conditions (mean percentage volume +/- SD: 5.91 +/- 6.25%), while moth consumption increased sixfold (mean percentage volume +/- SD: 35.42 +/- 17.90%) under lit conditions despite a decrease in relative moth abundance. Predictive prey-selection models that included high-efficacy estimates for eared-moth defensive behaviour found most support given diet data for bats in unlit conditions. Conversely, models that estimated eared-moth defensive behaviour as absent or low found more support given diet data for bats in lit conditions. Our models therefore suggest the increase in moth consumption was a result of light-induced, decreased eared-moth defensive behaviour.        4. Policy implications. In the current context of unyielding growth in global light pollution, we predict that specialist moth-eating bats and eared moths will face ever-increasing challenges to survival through increased resource competition and predation risk, respectively. Lights should be developed to be less attractive to moths, with the goal of reducing effects on moth behaviour. Unfortunately, market preference for broad-spectrum lighting and possible effects on other taxa make development of moth-friendly lighting improbable. Mitigation should therefore focus on the reduction of temporal, spatial and luminance redundancy in outdoor lighting. Restriction of light inside nature reserves and urban greenbelts can help maintain dark refugia for moth-eating bats and moths, and may become important for their persistence.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  71     Total Times Cited:  72     Cited Reference Count:  46 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/1365-2664.12381     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),arms race;Cape serotine bat;co-evolution;eared moth;Lepidoptera;light pollution;Neoromicia capensis;predator-prey interactions;prey selection;ARTIFICIAL-LIGHT;SPECTRAL COMPOSITION;INSECTIVOROUS BATS;INSECTS;MOTHS;BRITAIN;ENERGY;TIME;Continental Population Groups;Prednisolone,,

Our objective was to characterize the influence of selection and availability of escape cover and maternal presence on predator evasion by white-tailed deer, Odocoileus virginianus, fawns in the northern Great Plains, U. S. A. We observed 45 coyote, Canis latrans, chases of fawns, and we participated in 83 human chases of fawns during 2007-2009, of which, 19 and 42 chases, respectively, ended with capture of the fawn. Evasive techniques used by fawns were similar for human and coyote chases. Likelihood of a white-tailed deer fawn escaping capture, however, was influenced by deer group size and a number of antipredator behaviours, including aggressive defence by females, initial habitat and selection of escape cover, all of which were modified by the presence of parturient females. At the initiation of a chase, fawns in grasslands were more likely to escape, whereas fawns in forested cover, cultivated land or wheat were more likely to be captured by a coyote or human. Fawns fleeing to wetlands and grasslands also were less likely to be captured compared with those choosing forested cover, wheat and cultivated land. Increased probability of capture was associated with greater distance to wetland and grassland habitats and decreased distance to wheat. Use of wetland habitat as a successful antipredator strategy highlights the need for a greater understanding of the importance of habitat complexity in predator avoidance.

Impaired flight abilities due to increased wing loading may increase vulnerability to predation. To compensate for an increase in wing loading, birds are able to independently decrease body mass (BM) or increase pectoral muscle mass (PMM). Comparing nearshore and farshore foraging shorebird species, we develop a theory as to which of these responses should be the most appropriate. We hypothesize that nearshore foragers should respond to increased predation by increasing their PMM in order to promote speed-based escape. Instead, farshore foragers should decrease BM in order to improve agility for maneuvering escape. Experiments on 2 shorebird species are consistent with these predictions, but on the basis of the theoretical framework for evaluating effect size and biological significance developed here, more experiments are clearly needed.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  45     Total Times Cited:  46     Cited Reference Count:  84 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1093/beheco/arp146     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),aerodynamics;body mass;escape performance;flight;pectoral muscle;phenotypic flexibility;raptors;risk management;PECTORAL MUSCLE MASS;BODY-MASS;RED KNOTS;MORPHOLOGICAL ADAPTATIONS;MIGRATORY STOPOVER;MANEUVERING FLIGHT;CALIDRIS-CANUTUS;ACCIPITER-NISUS;HABITAT USE;ORGAN SIZE;Prednisolone,,

In addition, by solving the corresponding Fokker-Plauck equation, we obtain the explicit probability density function around the quasi-stable equilibrium of the transformed stochastic system without pollution.

Of particular importance may be the ability of an invader to detect and respond to unfamiliar potential predators. We examined a behavior related to dispersal in populations of the New Zealand mud snail (Potamopyrgus antipodarum) in response to chemical cues from crayfish and piscine predators. Populations of the snail isolated from North America and its native New Zealand were used in two separate experiments. In both experiments, groups of snails were placed in water either with or without predator cues, and the number of snails found floating attached to the surface tension of the water after ten minutes was noted. In the first experiment, a crayfish odor cue was used (from Procambarus clarkii), and, in the second, two fish, blacknose dace (Rhinichthys atratulus), and separately zebrafish (Danio rerio), were used to provide the chemical cues. In both experiments there was significant variation among populations in the proportion of snails that exhibited the floating behavior, with native populations tending to exhibit less floating behavior. The snails generally increased floating behavior in response to both crayfish and blacknose dace but not to zebrafish. In addition, we found no differences between populations of snails in their response to predator cues. Surprisingly, we also found that there were differences in floating proportions between populations of the same invasive clonal genotypes. These results suggest this behavior, which may be related to dispersal within water bodies, may be important in partially explaining the invasion success of the most common invasive clones in North America.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  6     Total Times Cited:  6     Cited Reference Count:  77 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.3391/ai.2019.14.3.02     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),kairomone;crayfish;dace;zebrafish;FRESH-WATER SNAIL;SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION;AVOIDANCE-BEHAVIOR;FORAGING BEHAVIOR;ASEXUAL LINEAGES;LAKE-ONTARIO;CRAYFISH;RISK;RESPONSES;STREAMS;New Zealand;Prednisolone,,

The hen's presence on the nest is widely considered to be a good measure of nest defense; an incubating female camouflages the nest and may physically deter nest predators. Parental-investment theory suggests that investment should increase with the reproductive benefits expected from the current clutch of eggs. We used nest-temperature loggers to study how the rhythms of waterfowl incubation changed after the nest was partially destroyed by a predator. Contrary to the expected-benefits hypothesis, we found that hens significantly increased their investment after partial clutch loss: they took fewer recesses from incubation per day and extended their incubation by more than 200 min after a partial depredation. We suggest that when predators pose little risk to the incubating adult, those hens unable or unwilling to abandon a nest after partial clutch loss will increase parental investment to obtain at least some reproductive benefits.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  10     Total Times Cited:  10     Cited Reference Count:  55 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1525/cond.2013.120096     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),incubation;Gadwall;Mallard;nest attendance;parental investment;predation;waterfowl;INCUBATION BEHAVIOR;PARENTAL INVESTMENT;STRIPED SKUNKS;PREDATION RISK;SIZE;MALLARDS;SUCCESS;BIRDS;CONSEQUENCES;REPRODUCTION,,

This is well known for polygamous mammals, which are typically sexually dimorphic, and often express great variability in behavior and habitat selection between individuals as well between the sexes. Among monogamous mammals, however, variability in habitat selection should be explained by group characteristics and the presence of offspring rather than by sex. We evaluated this hypothesis in a socially monogamous rodent, the Eurasian beaver (Castor fiber), in a saturated Norwegian population. For the first time in this species we applied GPS tracking devices (N = 22 adult beavers, in 15 territories, 2009-2013), and used resource selection functions (i) to document population-wide habitat selection and the importance of 'territory' therein, and (ii) to evaluate which socio-ecological factors explained potential individual differences in habitat selection. We found that variation in habitat selection was stronger between territories than between years or individuals nested by territory. We identified that family size and the presence of kits, but not sex, explained individual variation in habitat selection. Adults with kits and/or larger families tended to exhibit low risk-taking behavior (avoiding human-related variables such as roads, buildings, and agricultural land), and stayed close to their main lodge (parental care). Our results show that habitat selection is a context-dependent mechanism even in a species which expresses very little behavioral and morphological dimorphism.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  16     Total Times Cited:  16     Cited Reference Count:  76 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s00442-015-3388-1     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Habitat selection;Behavioral contexts;Monogamy;Eurasian beaver;Castor fiber;SIZE-DISTANCE RELATION;CASTOR-FIBER;SCENT-MARKING;SEGREGATION;PREDATION;RESPONSES;PATTERNS;RISK;CONSERVATION;DIMORPHISM;Rodentia,,

They may completely lack or have an abbreviated amplexus, deposit terrestrial eggs and even offer paternal care. We studied the courtship and spawning behaviour of Nyctibatrachus humayuni from Matheran located in the northern region of the Western Ghats of India. The breeding season of N. humayuni coincides with the onset of south-west monsoon. Adult males vocalise from their calling sites on wet rocks/dead logs that often harbour egg clutches and females approach the calling males, resulting in a loose cephalic amplexus that lasts up to 10 minutes. The male dismounts and sits aside; then the female deposits the eggs and moves away from the spawning site or into the water. The mean clutch size and the egg diameter are found to be 30.3 +/- 1.89 and 2.44 +/- 0.04 mm, respectively. Once the female moves away following spawning, the male slowly moves on to the eggs and fertilises them. The males of N. humayuni appear to be territorial and offer parental care by attending the eggs only during night. Paternal egg attendance most probably reduces the risk of predation by nocturnal predators.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  11     Total Times Cited:  11     Cited Reference Count:  27 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1163/017353711X579786     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),amplexus;Anura;egg attendance;Nyctibatrachus;paternal care;spawning;TERRESTRIAL BREEDING FROG;PARENTAL CARE;SURVIVORSHIP;ANURA;Tocopherols,,

Differences in nest survival were estimated between two habitats (horticultural and agricultural) and among four replicate horticultural sites. Overall, we identified shared patterns of nest survival within a habitat but a significant interaction with different habitats. Critically, as predicted by life-history theory, we found that clutch-size consistently and positively co-varied with site-specific rates of nest survival. Although site-specific difference in habitat and variation in female quality cannot be ruled out as explanations for this pattern, our results support the hypothesis that females can manipulate their reproductive effort across different predation regimes. Future experimental work is required to test these alternate hypotheses explicitly, and to demonstrate the behavioural cues that might lead to variable levels of reproductive effort and trade-offs of maternal resources.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  6     Total Times Cited:  6     Cited Reference Count:  40 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1071/MU09017     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),"life-history theory;maternal effects;New Zealand;NEW-ZEALAND;GEOGRAPHIC-VARIATION;PASSERINE BIRDS;EGG-PRODUCTION;LIFE-HISTORY;TRADE-OFFS;TITS PARUS;SURVIVAL;QUALITY;RISK;Prednisolone;Candidiasis, Oral",,

Functional response models that predict the relationship between feeding rate and food density often include only two behavioural parameters, handling time and searching rate. However, vigilance can occupy a large proportion of foraging time and, consequently, may affect the functional response. Previous functional response models of granivorous birds showed no effect of vigilance on predicted feeding rates; these models assumed that all of handling time is compatible with vigilance and, therefore, overestimated the potential time for cost free vigilance to occur.        2. Here we have derived a new functional response model that incorporates the proportion of time spent vigilant (v) and the proportion of handling time that is compatible with vigilance (p). This model allows for the relationship between vigilance and handling to vary from completely compatible to mutually exclusive, and degrees in between.        3. To determine whether vigilance can affect the functional response of a granivorous bird, grey partridge Perdix perdix L, we measured the functional response and associated behavioural parameters, and used the behavioural estimates to parameterize the model. Any deviation from the feeding rates predicted using a model without vigilance indicates that vigilance is affecting the predicted functional response.        4. We found that vigilance only affected the predicted functional response at very low food densities (< 3 seeds m-2). Simulations show how the potential for vigilance to affect feeding rate (i.e. the values of p given v) increases as v increases. We parameterized the model using data from chaffinches Fringilla coelebs, which were shown to spend > 50% of their foraging time vigilant, and found that even with a high value of p vigilance reduced feeding rates at higher seed densities.        5. This study shows that vigilance can affect the feeding rate of a granivorous bird when either the proportion of time spent vigilant is high or the proportion of compatible handling time is low. This may affect larger scale ecological processes, i.e. spatial distribution of foragers and patterns of resource depletion, as individuals try to mitigate the effects of vigilance by maximizing their feeding rate whilst minimizing their predation risk.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  18     Total Times Cited:  18     Cited Reference Count:  38 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/j.1365-2435.2010.01735.x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),farmland birds;foraging behaviour;mechanistic models;GREY PARTRIDGES PERDIX;HABITAT STRUCTURE;FARMLAND BIRDS;GROUP-SIZE;FOOD;PREDATION;POPULATIONS;BEHAVIOR;CHOICE;COSTS,,

Do more complex ecosystems lead to significantly different evolutionary behaviour and new potential extinctions?        Mathematical method: Merging host-parasite models with predator-prey models. Analytically studying evolution using adaptive dynamics and trade-off and invasion plots, and carrying out numerical simulations.        Key assumptions: Mass action (general mixing). All individuals of a given phenotype are identical. Only prey vulnerable to infection. Mutations are small and rare (however, the assumption on the size of mutation is relaxed later). In simulations, very small (negligible) populations are at risk of extinction.        Conclusions: The presence of the predator can significantly change evolutionary outcomes for host resistance to a pathogen and can create branching points where none occurred previously. The pathogen (and sometimes the predator) is protected from exclusion if we take mutations to be arbitrarily small; however, relaxing the assumption on mutation size can lead to its exclusion. Increased resistance can drive the predator and/or pathogen to extinction depending on inter-species dynamics, such as the predator's preference for infected prey. Predator co-evolution can move exclusion boundaries and prevent the predator's own extinction if its rate of mutation is high enough (with respect to that of the prey).","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  10     Total Times Cited:  10     Cited Reference Count:  48 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",,adaptive dynamics;co-evolution;eco-epidemiology;extinction;parasite;singular strategy;TRADE-OFF;PREY MODEL;TOLERANCE;VIRULENCE;DYNAMICS;DISEASE;COEVOLUTION;PARASITES;RECOVERY;SYSTEMS;Prednisolone,,

Prior studies have estimated the effects of vertical swimming upon larval dispersal using mathematical models. However, most such studies consider just a small number of predefined swimming behaviors despite evidence that even seemingly insignificant changes to these behaviors can dramatically alter predictions of larval delivery. Additionally, the concurrent effects of vertical swimming upon predation risk, feeding opportunities and energy budgeting are not well characterized. We used a simple mathematical model of larval dispersal in upwelling-favorable conditions to investigate how a continuum of swimming behaviors affect these quantities simultaneously. Within this continuum, we identified two categories of successful behaviors. 'Mean-onshore' behaviors deliver most larvae to coastal habitats, but offer limited opportunities for feeding and alongshore movement during dispersal. By contrast, 'mean-offshore' behaviors deliver fewer larvae to shore, but permit more feeding, alongshore movement, and, potentially, safety from nearshore hazards. No behaviors considered achieved the benefits of both categories. We hypothesize that mean-onshore behaviors are advantageous for species with non-feeding larvae or sparse adult populations, while mean-offshore behaviors are advantageous for species with feeding larvae or crowded adult populations. Our results underscore the importance of considering how behavior interacts with environmental structure and individual biology while studying dispersal in marine and other ecosystems.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  96 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/oik.08585     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),advection-diffusion;coastal marine larvae;dispersal;mathematical model;stochastic process;vertical migration;DENDRASTER-EXCENTRICUS ESCHSCHOLTZ;CRAB CARCINUS-MAENAS;MYTILUS-EDULIS;CONCHOLEPAS-CONCHOLEPAS;UPWELLING ECOSYSTEM;MIGRATION BEHAVIOR;DISPERSAL DISTANCE;COMPETENT LARVAE;STROMBUS-GIGAS;QUEEN CONCH;Military Personnel;Larva,,

This insight recently led to the conceptual development of a landscape of coexistence that can be used to identify areas which can sustain large predator populations in human dominated landscapes. In this study we applied the landscape of coexistence concept to a large predator in Europe. We investigated to what extent Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx habitat selection is affected by human disturbance in a human dominated landscape. More specifically, we were interested in the existence of a tradeoff between the availability of roe deer, one of their main prey and avoidance of human disturbance and how this affects the spatio-temporal space use patterns of lynx. We found that lynx face a tradeoff between high prey availability and avoidance of human disturbance and that they respond to this by using areas of high prey availability (but also high human disturbance) during the night when human activity is low. Furthermore our analysis showed that lynx increase their travelling speed and remain more in cover when they are close to areas of high human disturbance. Despite clear behavioral adjustments in response to human presence, prey availability still proved to be the most important predictor of lynx occurrence at small spatial scale, whereas human disturbance was considerably less important. The results of our study demonstrate how spatio-temporal adaptations in habitat selection enable large carnivores to persist in human dominated landscapes and demonstrate the usefulness of the concept of a landscape of coexistence to develop adaptive management plans for endangered populations of large carnivores.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  30     Total Times Cited:  30     Cited Reference Count:  77 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/oik.04182     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),LYNX LYNX-LYNX;DEER CAPREOLUS-CAPREOLUS;RESOURCE SELECTION FUNCTIONS;EURASIAN LYNX;HABITAT SELECTION;SPATIOTEMPORAL DISTRIBUTION;BEHAVIORAL-RESPONSES;LARGE CARNIVORES;SPACE USE;PREY;Humanities;Humanism;Humans;Prednisolone,,

We study the combination of two stabilizing mechanisms in a two-patch Rosenzweig-MacArthur model with a novel density-dependent movement term. Specifically, we assume that prey move between patches according to their perceived predation risk, and we include travel time between patches as a time delay. We show that the combination of mechanisms may be destabilizing even though each mechanism by itself is stabilizing.

First, we conducted a differential gene expression, identifying a total of 125 candidate transcripts involved in the predator-induced response, uncovering substantial intraspecific variation. Second, we applied a gene coexpression network analysis to find clusters of tightly linked transcripts revealing the functional relations of transcripts underlying the predator-induced response. Our results showed that transcripts involved in remodeling of the cuticle, growth, and digestion correlated with the response to environmental change inD. galeata. Furthermore, we used an orthology-based approach to gain functional information for transcripts lacking gene ontology (GO) information, as well as insights into the evolutionary conservation of transcripts. We could show that our candidate transcripts have orthologs in otherDaphniaspecies but almost none in other arthropods.

We have worked out the conditions for local stability of the equilibrium points as well as persistence of the system. We have derived the ecological and disease basic reproduction numbers. These enable us to determine the community structure of the system. Harvesting may play a crucial role in a host-parasite system, and reasonable harvesting can remove parasite burden fromthe host.

When all animals are equal and fitness is well represented by intake rate, the ideal free distribution requires the animals to be distributed in such a way as to equalize intake rate in each feeding patch. We refer to this as the equal rates policy. This approach ignores the effect of stochasticity in the food supply on starvation. It also ignores predation. An alternative approach is based on the assumption that each animal tries to minimize its death rate. An optimal policy now involves making decisions about which patch to use on the basis of the current level of energy reserves. We investigate a simple model of population dynamics in which over-winter mortality is either derived from animals adopting the equal rates policy or the optimal state-dependent policy to decide between two feeding patches. We show that the state-dependent policy results in a larger equilibrium population size than the equal rates policy. This difference can be considerable when the foraging environment is very stochastic. Furthermore, the state-dependent policy may result in a viable equilibrium population when the equal rates policy does not. The equilibrium under the state-dependent policy may be less stable than that under the equal rates policy. We identify conditions under which the state-dependent policy results in approximately equal intake rates on the two feeding patches. Levels of mortality as a result of predation are investigated. We show that, under some circumstances, the proportion of mortality that is due to predation may decrease as the predation pressure increases.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  18     Total Times Cited:  18     Cited Reference Count:  36 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1023/A:1018486318976     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),food-predation trade-off;ideal free distribution;intake rate;population dynamics;probability of survival;risk-sensitive foraging;IDEAL FREE DISTRIBUTIONS;FORAGING BEHAVIOR;HABITAT LOSS;INDIVIDUAL VARIATIONS;PREY POPULATIONS;PREDATION RATE;ENERGY;MODELS;RISK;CONSEQUENCES;Population Density,,

The main risk of trap-building predators is the greater uncertainty of encountering prey, owing to their immobility. Sometimes environmental characteristics do not allow them to build efficient traps, resulting in lower capture success. We observed prey escape, capture success, and behavior of two antlion species, Cueta lineosa, a habitat specialist, and Myrmeleon hyalinus, a generalist, building geometrically different traps. The traps of C. lineosa are elaborate and deep, consisting of two inverted cones, while M. hyalinus builds simple inverted cones. Prey escape was observed from traps with antlion larvae present and from artificially constructed traps without antlions. We used a 3D printer to create a replica model of both trap types, pressing the model onto the substrate surface to create a trap. The C. lineosa artificial trap slowed prey escape more effectively than the simpler artificial trap of M. hyalinus. Prey escape time was four times longer for two ant species and three times longer for woodlice from C. lineosa traps. Escape time also decreased with increasing prey length. We also found behavioral differences between these two antlion species. The behavior of M. hyalinus is much more efficient in catching prey than that of C. lineosa. The results indicate that both species are efficient trap-building predators; however, it appears that capture success depends not only on trap design but also on larval behavior.        Antlion larvae are trap-building predators. The location of the ambush site is essential for larvae to build an effective trap, since trap characteristics significantly affect capture success. Deeper traps retain prey better and give larvae in the trap more time to grab the prey. However, sometimes the environment does not allow larvae to construct the most efficient trap, and the larvae can compensate for this by their behavior, making them successful hunters.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  1     Total Times Cited:  1     Cited Reference Count:  50 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1093/beheco/arab124     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),antlion larvae;artificial pit-fall trap;capture success;prey capture behavior;ANT-LION LARVAE;EUROLEON-NOSTRAS NEUROPTERA;PIT CONSTRUCTION;PARTICLE-SIZE;SYMPATRIC ANTLIONS;HABITAT SELECTION;BUILDING LARVAE;SITE SELECTION;RAIN-FOREST;MYRMELEON,,

Previous studies have shown that aggregations can form using simple movement rules designed to decrease each animal's Domain of Danger. However, if the predator attacks from outside the group's perimeter, these simple movement rules might not lead to aggregation. To test whether simple selfish movement rules would decrease predation risk for those situations when the predator attacks from outside the flock perimeter, we constructed a computer model that allowed flocks of 75 simulated fiddler crabs to react to one another, and to a predator attacking from 7 m away. We attacked simulated crab flocks with predators of different sizes and attack speeds, and computed relative predation risk after 120 time steps. Final trajectories showed flight toward the center of the flock, but curving away from the predator. Path curvature depended on the predator's size and approach speed. The average crab experienced a greater decrease in predation risk when the predator was small or slow moving. Regardless of the predator's size and speed, however, predation risk always decreased as long as crabs took their flock-mates into account. We conclude that, even when flight away from an external predator occurs, the selfish avoidance of danger can lead to aggregation.

As such behaviors may also imply fitness costs, the ability of prey to perceive and appropriately respond to the predation threat is crucial to determine the persistence of its populations. Little is known whether antipredatory behaviors adopted by prey fish species are predator-specific or a general strategy employed regardless of predator species. Here, we used two phylogenetically close piscivorous fish species (Hoplias sp. 2 and Hoplerythrinus unitaeniatus) with similar morphology and foraging strategy (ambushing) to test whether prey (Moenkhausia sanctaefilomenae and Astyanax lacustris) behavioral responses were related to predator species identity. We video recorded and evaluated prey refuge use, habitat segregation, shoal formation, and mobility in microcosms before and after the addition of each predator. We found that M. sanctaefilomenae responded to the addition of Hoplias sp. 2 by reducing its mobility and keeping as far as possible from the predator location in a vigilant state, while shoal formation was employed regardless of predator species.

These are captured by a mathematical model for the exchange of biomass between a structured predator population (continuous weight distribution) and a resource. Because the predator's mating success affects the amount of resources required for the production of offsprings and their future growth into mature organisms, it influences the flux of biomass between trophic levels. Under simple assumptions, the equations can be reduced to an equivalent unstructured predator-prey model in which the Allee effect modulates the predation rate: the mating probability multiplies the rate of predator growth as well as the rate of resource depletion. Implications of the Allee effect for the bifurcation structure and equilibrium densities are examined. The model is compared to a modified version in which the Allee effect instead modulates the assimilation efficiency, hence the mating probability does not appear in the dynamical equation for the resource density. Both models exhibit qualitatively similar dynamics. However, compared to the model in which the Allee effect modulates predation, the model in which the Allee effect modulates assimilation efficiency predicts (i) unrealistically inefficient resource assimilation when predator density is low, (ii) a higher risk of catastrophic extinction resulting from a change in the parameter controlling the strength of the Allee effect, and (iii) no possibility of an increase in population size when the density dependence is enhanced.

Similarly, when measuring the proportion of resources harvested within the patches, we observed a marginal preference for patches with initially high densities. Models analyzing behavioral choices at the population level found no differences in behavior between the two species, but models analyzing choices at the individual level uncovered some variation.

Nevertheless, evaluation of migratory portfolios (i.e., the variation in migratory behaviors across space and time among individuals within populations) has received relatively little attention in migratory ungulates, where research has focused largely on the dichotomous behaviors (e.g., resident and migrant) of partially migratory populations. Using GPS data from 361 female bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) across 17 (4 restored, 6 augmented, 7 native) populations in Montana and Wyoming, USA, we (1) characterized migratory portfolios based on behavioral and spatial migratory characteristics and (2) evaluated the relative influence of landscape attributes and management histories on migratory diversity. Native populations, which had been extant on the landscape for many generations, had more diverse migratory portfolios, higher behavioral switching rates, reduced seasonal range fidelity, and broad dispersion of individuals across summer and winter ranges. In contrast, restored populations with an abbreviated history on the landscape were largely non-migratory with a narrow portfolio of migratory behaviors, less behavioral switching, higher fidelity to seasonal ranges, and less dispersion on summer and winter ranges. Augmented populations were more variable and contained characteristics of both native and restored populations. Differences in migratory diversity among populations were associated with management histories (e.g., restored, augmented, or native). Landscape characteristics such as the duration and regularity of green-up, human landscape alterations, topography, and snow gradients were not strongly associated with migratory diversity. We suggest a two-pronged approach to restoring migratory portfolios in ungulates that first develops behavior-specific habitat models and then places individuals with known migratory behaviors into unoccupied areas in an effort to bolster migratory portfolios in restored populations, potentially with synergistic benefits associated with variation among individuals and resulting portfolio effects. Management efforts to restore diverse migratory portfolios may increase the abundance, resilience, and long-term viability of ungulate populations.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  9     Total Times Cited:  9     Cited Reference Count:  69 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1002/eap.2106     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),bighorn sheep;green wave;individual heterogeneity;migration;migratory diversity;mountain ungulate;Ovis canadensis;portfolio effects;restoration;Yellowstone;APPARENT COMPETITION;NORTHERN UNGULATE;PREDATION RISK;BIGHORN;PATTERNS;CONSEQUENCES;PERSISTENCE;PNEUMONIA;BENEFITS;Mountaineering,,

Scrounging may be more advantageous in the centre of the group, having more individuals around to join, while producing may be more beneficial at the edges, where more unexplored food patches may be found. This study shows within-flock position correlates with foraging tactic use of feeding birds in socially foraging tree sparrows, Passer montanus. Sparrows staying closer to the centre of the flock found their food patches more frequently by joining (i.e. use more frequently the scrounging tactic) than those staying toward the edges. To our knowledge this is the first field study demonstrating the relationship between spatial position and foraging tactic use. We investigated this relationship under different perceived predation hazard, and found that under elevated risk of predation, central individuals may increase their use of joining more than individuals on the periphery of the flock. Moreover, we show that extremely specialized use of searching tactics may be very infrequent in tree sparrows. As both within-flock position and search tactic use can be altered very quickly and without leaving the flock, individuals may easily alter them in order to adjust their behaviour.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  15     Total Times Cited:  16     Cited Reference Count:  26 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/j.1439-0310.2007.01472.x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),ENERGY RESERVES;HOUSE SPARROWS;PRODUCER;DOMINANCE;RISK;SCROUNGERS;GEOMETRY;CHOICE;BIRDS;GAMES;Trees,,

These interactions are particularly significant where agriculture and forestry occur and where intensive grazing and browsing by wild ungulates can result in economic losses to growing crops and trees. We studied plant-herbivore interactions in a moose (Alces alces)-dominant system where forestry is a primary economy, the primary and secondary road networks are extensive, and wolves (Canis lupus) are recolonizing. Wolves and humans use low-traffic, secondary roads, yet roadsides provide high-quality and quantity browse for moose. Foraging theory predicts that moose will respond to riskier landscapes by selecting habitats that reduce predation risk, sacrificing feeding time or food quality. As food becomes limiting, however, animals will accept higher predation risk in search of food. We predicted that road avoidance behavior would be strongest within wolf territories. In areas without wolves, moose should select roadsides for their high forage availability. To test these predictions, we measured moose browsing and counted pellet groups as a proxy for habitat use each spring in Norway and Sweden between 2008 and 2018, in areas with and without wolves and at different distances from primary and secondary roads. We used generalized linear mixed models to evaluate drivers of the probability of browsing occurrence and browsing pressure. We found that browsing occurrence increased closer to secondary roads but decreased closer to primary roads. We also found browsing patterns to vary among tree species. For Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), the browsing occurrence was two times higher in young forests relative to non-young forests and decreased further from secondary roads. Wolf territory presence and probability had neutral or positive effect on browsing occurrence and pressure for all species. However, wolf territory presence had negative effects on browsing occurrence and pressure when interacting with secondary roads, young forest, or snow cover. We showed that roads can influence browsing patterns in Norway and Sweden. However, further research is needed, particularly in the face of continued infrastructure development in Scandinavia.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  2     Total Times Cited:  2     Cited Reference Count:  124 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1002/ecs2.3358     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Alces alces;browsing;forestry;roads;Scandinavia;trophic cascades;ungulates;wolves,,

The number of dead and falling trees from this epidemic likely will affect how elk (Cervus canadensis) and hunters use the forest and their interactions. Downed trees potentially create a component of refuge habitat that could affect the effectiveness of hunting to regulate abundance of growing elk populations. We evaluated how forests affected by bark beetles in south-central Wyoming, USA, influenced resource selection of 50 female elk and 374 hunters in 2012-2016, and interactions between elk and hunters. We employed global positioning system (GPS) technology on elk and hunters, and developed a satellite-derived land classification specifically depicting beetle-affected forests. We tested the predictions that elk would increase use of beetle-killed areas from summer to the hunting season, and that hunters would avoid beetle-killed areas regardless of elk use. Elk increased use of beetle-killed areas during hunting seasons as did hunters during the archery season; however, during the rifle season, hunters avoided beetle-killed areas. Nevertheless, during the rifle season, areas of beetle-kill with a high probability of elk occurrence dampened the aversion hunters had towards beetle-killed areas. Therefore, in contrast to our expectations, forests that have been altered by the bark-beetle epidemic may only function marginally as a refuge for elk. Our study area was at the beginning of the tree-fall phase (i.e., similar to 3-7 yr after peak infestation) of the bark-beetle epidemic; thus, future research efforts should focus on how a continued increase in downed trees will influence interactions between elk and hunters. At current levels of tree fall, however, beetle-kill should not limit the ability of managers to regulate elk herds through harvest.

We used stimuli from (1) matching sized conspecifics, large (2) Arctic charr, (3) salmon, (4) brown trout and (5) brown trout fed on Arctic charr fry. Other salmonids were given pellet food. Additional fish odour treatments included piscivorous (6) pike and (7) burbot. In the control trials both sides received control water. Arctic charr young were expected to respond adaptively to the stimuli from coexisting piscivorous fish. The charr most strongly preferred water with the odour of their matching sized conspecifics, which was the only fish odour they were familiar with before the experiments. They also showed significant preference for other salmonid odours, even though these fish are potential predators on small charr. Chemical stimuli from pike and burbot, on the contrary, were strongly avoided, and burbot odour even prevented the charr to swim and enter the lateral halves of the fluviarum. Moreover, odour from brown trout fed on Arctic charr fry was avoided when compared to stimuli from trout fed on pellets.

After 2 days, eggs on the host were significantly more likely to have disappeared compared to eggs laid elsewhere.        4.

In an effort to redress this imbalance, we compared responses of male and female Wistar rats during exposure to two unconditioned threatening stimuli that evoke panic-related defensive behaviours: confrontation with a predator (Bothrops alternatus) and acute exposure to hypoxia (7% O-2). Threatened by venomous snake, male and female rats initially displayed defensive attention, risk assessment, and cautious interaction with the snake, progressing to defensive immobility to overt escape. Both males and females displayed higher levels of risk assessment but less interaction with the predator. They also spent more time in the burrow, displaying inhibitory avoidance, and more time engaged in defensive attention, and non-oriented escape behaviour. In females, anxiety-like behaviour was most pronounced in the oestrous and proestrus phases whereas panic-like behaviour was more pronounced during the dioestrus phase, particularly during late dioestrus. Acute hypoxia evoked panic-like behaviour (undirected jumping) in both sexes, but in females, responsiveness in late dioestrus was significantly greater than at other stages of the cycle. The results reveal that females respond in a qualitatively similar manner to males during exposure to naturally occurring threatening stimuli, but the responses of females is oestrous cycle dependent with a significant exacerbation of panic-like behaviour in the late dioestrus phase.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  60 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/ejn.15548     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),"acute hypoxia;male and female rats;oestrous cycle;panic;prey-versus-snake confrontation;urutu-cruzeiro lancehead pit viper;PERIAQUEDUCTAL GREY-MATTER;FEAR-INDUCED ANTINOCICEPTION;DORSAL RAPHE NUCLEUS;DEFENSIVE BEHAVIORS;SHORT-TERM;VENTROMEDIAL HYPOTHALAMUS;DORSOMEDIAL HYPOTHALAMUS;MENSTRUAL-CYCLE;ANXIETY;MICE;Rats;Rats, Wistar;Anoxia",,

In addition, further discussion has centered on whether or not the choice of model formulation has an effect on model inference. The study goal was to evaluate changes in the number of 10 songbird species in relation to a suite of environmental covariates, testing for any evidence in support of a predator effect using multiple model formulations to check for consistency in the results. We compare two different approaches to the analysis of long-term garden bird monitoring data. The first approach models change in the prey species between 1970 and 2005 as a function of environmental covariates, including the abundance of an avian predator, while the second uses a change-change approach. Significant negative relationships were found between Eurasian Sparrowhawk Accipiter nisus and three of the 10 species analyzed, namely house Sparrow Passer domesticus, starling Sturnus vulgaris, and blue tit Cyanistes caeruleus. The results were consistent under both modeling approaches. It is not clear if this is a direct negative impact on the overall populations of these species or a behavioral response of the prey species to avoid feeding stations frequented by Sparrowhawks (which may in turn have population consequences, by reducing available resources). The species showing evidence of negative effects of Sparrowhawks were three of the four species most at risk to Sparrowhawk predation according to their prevalence in the predator's diet. The associations could be causal in nature, although in practical terms the reduction in the rate of change in numbers visiting gardens accredited to Sparrowhawks is relatively small, and so unlikely to be the main driver of observed population declines.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  2     Total Times Cited:  2     Cited Reference Count:  54 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1002/ece3.5702     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),population change;predation;predators;songbirds;Tweedie distribution;SPARROW PASSER-DOMESTICUS;HOUSE SPARROWS;REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS;ACCIPITER-NISUS;FARMLAND BIRDS;POPULATION;DECLINES;TRENDS;MODEL;SIZE,,

Recent developments in efficient computer-based video analyses have allowed testing pesticide effects on model species such as the zebrafish. However, these new techniques have not yet been applied to amphibians and directly to conservation issues. i.e., to assess toxicological risks on threatened species. We used video-tracking analyses to test a quantitative effect of an environmental contaminant on the locomotion of amphibian tadpoles (Rana temporaria) by taking into account cumulative effects. Because recent research has demonstrated effects of de-icing salts on survival and community structure, we used sodium chloride in our experimental design (25 replicates, 4 concentrations, 4 times) to test for an effect at the scale of behavior at environmentally relevant concentrations. Analysis of 372 1-h video-tracks (5 samples/s) showed a complex action of salts on behavioral patterns with a dose and cumulative response over time. Although no effects were found on mortality or growth, the highest salt concentrations reduced the speed and movement of tadpoles in comparison with control treatments. The reduced locomotor performance could have detrimental consequences in terms of tadpoles' responses to competition and predation and may be an indicator of the low concentration effect of the contaminant. On one hand, this study demonstrates the usefulness of examining behavior to address conservation issues and understand the complex action of environmental factors and, more particularly, pollutants on organisms. On the other hand, our results highlight the need of new computerized techniques to quantitatively analyze these patterns. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The presence of refuge for prey decreases predation risk and can have important impacts on the sustainability of a predator-prey system. The principal purpose of this paper is to formulate and analyze a refuge mediated predator-prey model when the refuge is available to protect a portion of prey from predation. We study the effect of the refuge size on the biomass ratio and extend our refuge model to incorporate fishing and predator migration separately. Our study suggests that decreasing the refuge size, increasing the predator fishing, and increasing the predator emigration stabilizes the system. Here, we investigate the dependence of Hopf bifurcation on refuge size in the presence of fishing or predator migration. Moreover, we discuss their effects on the biomass pyramid and establish a condition for the emergence of an inverted biomass pyramid. We perform numerical test and sensitivity analysis to check the robustness of our results and the relative importance of all parameters. We find that high fishing pressure may destroy the inverted biomass pyramid and thus decrease the resilience of reef ecosystems. In addition, increasing the emigration rate or decreasing the immigration rate decreases the predator-prey biomass ratio. An inverted biomass pyramid can occur in the presence of a stable limit cycle.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  2     Total Times Cited:  3     Cited Reference Count:  26 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.mbs.2017.12.007     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Predator-prey model with refuge;Inverted biomass pyramid;Hopf bifurcation;Effects of fishing;Predator migration;MODEL;STABILITY;BIFURCATION;BEHAVIOR;SYSTEM;Prednisolone,,

We then determine which model best applies to nest predation on woodland songbirds and artificial nests by a natural population of raccoons. Using artificial nests, we showed that increasing the density of nests placed either in shrubs or on the ground increased overall predation (i.e., proportion of nests) on both types. We also tested for apparent competition between American robin and wood thrush, two coexisting woodland songbirds that commonly nest within the shrub stratum. Nest predation increased for wood thrushes but not robins as the combined density of robin and thrush nests within two individual substrate types, Lonicera and Rhamnus, increased. Thus, we documented apparent competition both within and among nesting guilds. We discuss the possible relevance of this interaction in determining species diversity, particularly in the light of increasing generalist nest predators through anthropogenically driven changes in human-altered landscapes.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  58     Total Times Cited:  60     Cited Reference Count:  46 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1086/286177     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),competition;foraging theory;predation;raccoon;resource partitioning;songbirds;APPARENT COMPETITION;EVOLUTIONARY GAME;PREY COMMUNITIES;PATTERNS;ORGANIZATION;DIVERSITY;BEHAVIOR;RISK;WEBS;Prednisolone,,

A simple mathematical model can be used to calculate the maximum predator abundance compatible with positive growth of solitary bee populations. Using published data to estimate model parameters, the model shows that medium-sized (20-80 mg dry weight) solitary bees are very sensitive to predation and their populations can hardly grow when 1-2% of flowers are occupied by ambush predators-a predator abundance well within the range reported in most studies. Smaller and larger bees, on the other hand, can easily cope with normal predator abundances: small bees do not need to visit many flowers to provision an offspring, making it unlikely that they encounter a predator, and large bees are less vulnerable to predator attacks. According to a sensibility analysis, the parameters with the greatest impact on bee population viability are the number of flowers that bees must exploit to provision an offspring and the probability that a bee, upon landing on a predator-harboring flower, is actually captured. It follows that ambush predators cannot be excluded a priori from the list of factors affecting bee diversity and abundance: small changes in the abundance of ambush predators, possibly related to changes in the availability of alternative prey, could have dramatic effects on the viability of medium-sized solitary bees.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  10     Total Times Cited:  10     Cited Reference Count:  34 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1093/beheco/arr228     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),antipredator behavior;Apoidea;pollinator decline;population regulation;predation;provisioning cost;CRAB SPIDERS;BOTTOM-UP;POLLINATORS;RISK;DECLINES;FORCES;PLANTS;SIZE;Prednisolone,,

Despite frequent local extinctions, the predator-prey metapopulation persists and exhibits either large-amplitude cycles or small-amplitude aperiodic fluctuations. This chapter reviews how our understanding of predator and prey metapopulation dynamics in mites has been advanced by comparing laboratory experiments with both a ""baseline"" model and simulation models that break down the assumptions of the ""baseline"" model. The most critical assumptions are that: 1) habitat structure matters, but spatial configuration does not; and 2) local dynamics of prey and predator are deterministic, fully determined by the first colonization and always end in prey extinction after a single oscillation, followed by predator dispersal. The ""baseline"" model predicts multiple stable states, either with or without predators, when there are many patches that harbor only few prey. Stable predator-prey cycles surface, however, when the number of patches is low and can harbor many prey. Virtually all acarine predator-prey metapopulation experiments published to date have been done under the latter conditions and show metapopulation-level cycles that are either periodic with large amplitudes or aperiodic with small amplitudes. Simulations suggest the large amplitude cycles arise when survival in the dispersal phase is low, whereas the small amplitude cycles surface when survival in the dispersal phase is relatively higher, yet low enough to allow persistence of predators and prey at the metapopulation level. The ""baseline"" model is further analyzed to detect which factors cause persistence or extinction at the metapopulation level. Persistence was promoted by prey dispersal from predator-occupied patches, time spent by prey in the dispersal phase, interception of predators in predator-occupied patches, and heterogeneous colonization risks among patches. Extinction is promoted by predator dispersal after extermination of prey in a patch and time spent by predators in the dispersal phase. The relative importance of all of these factors is yet to be determined. Moreover, the relevance of spatial patterning of predator-prey interactions is much debated. Model-based simulations to analyze an experimentally established time series suggest that what matters to persistence is reduced discovery of prey patches, not the spatial configuration per se. However, the last word has not been said about this, since spatial predator-prey models suggest configuration to play an important role.        The ""baseline"" model is not evolutionary robust, in that its structure arises from individual traits that are not favored by natural selection. It is based on the assumption that first colonization is the single determinant of local predator or prey dynamics and that predator dispersal is delayed until after prey extermination. Delayed predator dispersal cannot evolve, however, when only the initial colonization of prey-only patches by a predator is taken into account. It also does not evolve in simulations with a model, parameterized for the acarine predator-prey system, in which not only the first colonization but also subsequent invasions are taken into account. However, observations on the behavior of field-collected predators show that delayed dispersal is the rule rather than the exception. We argue that delayed predator dispersal prevails in the field because local populations are subject to catastrophes which give predators little control over the exploitation of their local prey population. Hence, natural selection in the field will favor predators that exploit the local prey population as fast as possible and delay dispersal until after prey extermination.        The important lesson to be drawn from this review is that the insights came from comparing a suite of models that all differed in key assumptions from a comprehensive yet formal ""baseline"" model and from testing these models against laboratory experiments. Understanding the complex dynamics observed in acarine predator-prey metapopulations requires more than spotting an arbitrary caricatural model with a dynamic behavior that corresponds qualitatively to that of the biological system.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  17     Total Times Cited:  17     Cited Reference Count:  63 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Maybe""}",10.1016/S0065-2504(04)37006-6     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),HOST-PARASITOID SYSTEMS;METAPOPULATION DYNAMICS;KIN RECOGNITION;DISPERSAL;MODELS;STABILITY;AGGREGATION;MITES;EXPLOITATION;STRATEGIES;Mathematics;Prednisolone;Exercise,,

Using phylogenetic comparative methods, we attempt to identify the ecological and environmental correlates of body armour that may hint at the selective pressures responsible for defensive trait diversification. Our results show that species inhabiting arid environments are more likely to possess elaborated body armour, specifically osteoderms. We did not find any effect of estimated predation pressure or risk on the degree of body armour. These findings suggest that body armour might not necessarily evolve in response to direct interactions with predators, but rather as a result of increased habitat-mediated predation risk. Furthermore, we discuss the possibility that osteoderms might have been shaped by factors unrelated to predation.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  17     Total Times Cited:  17     Cited Reference Count:  56 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1098/rspb.2018.0513     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),adaptive radiation;body armour;correlated evolution;osteoderm;predation;predator-prey interactions;THREESPINE STICKLEBACK;TRAIT DIVERSIFICATION;WATER-LOSS;BEHAVIOR;SELECTION;SHIFTS;DIVERGENCE;PLASTICITY;PREDATORS;DEFENSES;Lizards,,

Using an information-theoretic, non-linear regression approach, our analyses showed that buffalo in this area can be divided into 4 migratory classes: migrants, non-migrants, dispersers, and a new class that we call ""expanders"". Multimodel inference from least-squares regressions of wet season movements showed that environmental conditions (rainfall, fires, woodland cover, vegetation biomass), distance to the nearest barrier (river, fence, cultivated area) and social factors (age, size of herd at capture) were all important in explaining variation in migratory behaviour. The relative contributions of these variables to partial migration have not previously been assessed for ungulates in the tropics. Understanding the factors driving migratory decisions of wildlife will lead to better-informed conservation and land-use decisions in this area.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  50     Total Times Cited:  51     Cited Reference Count:  55 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1371/journal.pone.0036527     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),PREDATION RISK;BEHAVIOR;MIGRANT;ECOLOGY;FORAGE;NDVI;SIZE,,

This has also included efficiency improvement of moving techniques, which include increased working speeds and widths. Therefore, the risk of wild animals being accidentally injured or killed during routine farming operations has increased dramatically over the years. In particular, the nests of ground nesting bird species like grey partridge (Perdix perdix) or pheasant (Phasianus colchicus) are vulnerable to farming operations in their breeding habitat, whereas in mammals, the natural instinct of e. g., leverets of brown hare (Lepus europaeus) and fawns of roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) to lay low and still in the vegetation to avoid predators increase their risk of being killed or injured in farming operations. Various methods and approaches have been used to reduce wildlife mortality resulting from farming operations. However, since wildlife-friendly farming often results in lower efficiency, attempts have been made to develop automatic systems capable of detecting wild animals in the crop. Here we assessed the suitability of thermal imaging in combination with digital image processing to automatically detect a chicken (Gallus domesticus) and a rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) in a grassland habitat. Throughout the different test scenarios, our study animals were detected with a high precision, although the most dense grass cover reduced the detection rate. We conclude that thermal imaging and digital imaging processing may be an important tool for the improvement of wildlife-friendly farming practices in the future.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  26     Total Times Cited:  26     Cited Reference Count:  29 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.3390/s120607587     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),thermal imaging;image processing;human-wildlife relationship;wildlife-friendly farming;CORNCRAKE CREX CREX;BEHAVIOR;IMAGERY;FAWNS;GAME;Animal Shells;Animals,,

One of the most remarkable behaviors of animal species is the aggregation by which species can reduce predation risk as a consequence of dilution or the other effects by forming a group. Empirical studies have demonstrated that an incompatibility exists in aggregation sincere source competition might become severe at the cost of reducing predation pressure from predatory species. Parental care by supplying the food consumed by adults to their juveniles would reduce the mortality of juvenile due to starvation, but it would reduce the reproduction rate at the same time. In this paper, we study a class of stage structured resource-consumer models to investigate the effect of behavioral changes on population dynamics. It is shown that under the presence of trade-off in parental care, moderate degrees of parental care will be favored as maximizing the equilibrium density of consumers. For consumer species having a long maturation period, consumer species might get benefit from dilution effects as a result of aggregation despite the elevated resource competition. Aggregation gives rise to two different outcomes in consumer extinction. Resource exhaustion as a consequence of over-exploitation can induce extinction of consumers due to Allee effects if aggregation strongly mediates juvenile survival. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Each summer, the burrow-dwelling amphipod Corophium volutator is heavily preyed upon by Semipalmated Sandpipers (Calidris pusilla) on mudflats in the upper Bay of Fundy, Canada. We conducted three complementary studies to determine if adult C. volutator exhibit predator avoidance behavior in the presence of sandpipers. In a field experiment, we monitored vertical distribution of C. volutator adults in bird exclosures and adjacent control plots before sandpipers arrived and during their stopover. We also made polymer resin casts of C. volutator burrows in the field throughout the summer. Finally, we simulated shorebird pecking in a lab experiment and observed C. volutator behavior in their burrows. C. volutator adults were generally distributed deeper in the sediment later in the summer (after sandpipers arrived). In August, this response was detectably stronger in areas exposed to bird predation than in bird exclosures. During peak predator abundance, many C. volutator adults were beyond the reach of feeding sandpipers (>1.5 cm deep). However, burrow depth did not change significantly throughout the summer. Detailed behavioral observations indicated that C. volutator spent more time at the bottom of their burrow when exposed to a simulated predator compared to controls. This observed redistribution suggests that C. volutator adults move deeper into their burrows as an anti-predator response to the presence of sandpipers. This work has implications for predators that feed on burrow-dwelling invertebrates in soft-sediment ecosystems, as density may not accurately estimate prey availability.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  5     Total Times Cited:  5     Cited Reference Count:  96 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1371/journal.pone.0110633     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),MIGRATING SEMIPALMATED SANDPIPERS;REDSHANK TRINGA-TOTANUS;RISK TRADE-OFF;PREY AVAILABILITY;CALIDRIS-PUSILLA;VERTICAL-DISTRIBUTION;REPRODUCTIVE-BIOLOGY;ARENARIUM CRUSTACEA;ILYANASSA-OBSOLETA;AVOIDANCE-BEHAVIOR;Canada;Prednisolone,,

The strength of migration of zooplankton increases with a rise in the abundance of predators and their exudates (kairomone). Recent studies span multiple trophic levels, which lead to the concept of coupled vertical migration. The migrations that occur at one trophic level can affect the vertical migration of the next lower trophic level, and so on, throughout the food chain. This is called cascading migration. In this paper, we introduce cascading migration in a well-known model (Hastings and Powell, Ecology 73:896-903, 1991). We represent the dynamics of the system as proposed by Hastings and Powell as a phytoplankton-zooplankton-fish (prey-middle predator-top predator) model where fish affect the migrations of zooplankton, which in turn affect the migrations of motile phytoplankton. The system under cascading migration enhances system stability and population coexistence. It is also observed that for a higher rate of cascading migration, the system shows chaotic behavior. We conclude that the observations of Hastings and Powell remain true if the cascading migration rate is high enough.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  18     Total Times Cited:  18     Cited Reference Count:  52 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Maybe""}",10.1007/s10867-013-9311-2     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Kairomone;Inducible defense;Diel vertical migration;Coexistence;Stability;Hopf-bifurcation;Chaos;DIEL VERTICAL MIGRATION;ADAPTIVE SIGNIFICANCE;PREDATOR;DINOFLAGELLATE;ZOOPLANKTON;BEHAVIOR;POPULATION;CHAOS;AGGREGATION;DINOPHYCEAE;Mathematics;Food,,

As a case study of this assumption, we assess the hypothesis that daily and seasonal activity and microhabitat use by wandering wolf spiders (Lycosidae: Schizocosa) searching for four common grasshopper species (Orthoptera: Acrididae) are coincident under natural conditions. There was great overlap in seasonal phenology and use of microbabitats between spiders and grasshoppers. Grasshoppers that were suitably sized (10-20 mm in length) as prey for spiders were relatively abundant from late spring through summer in this grassland. Three of the four common grasshopper species used microhabitat in a similar way, but differed from a fourth common species, Phoetaliotes nebrascensis. However, when they were active, spiders were about equally distributed between open microhabitats on the ground and up in the vegetation so that all grasshopper species were at risk. In response to temperature, spiders were active for only a portion of the day during which grasshoppers were also active so that the actual daily ""Window-of-opportunity"" for capture each day was much smaller than expected. Spiders were more likely to be active during the early morning and evening, while grasshoppers were active during all daylight hours, most likely because of differences in thermal preferences. Schizocosa and their grasshopper prey are largely coincident in time and space except for overlap in daily activity which, presumably, reflects differences in thermal preferences. Consequently, overlap in daily time budgets that ensure actual encounter was reduced about 50%. The significance of this difference to the inclusion of simple mass-action dynamics in predator-prey models requires further consideration, but may be important.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  24     Total Times Cited:  24     Cited Reference Count:  55 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1674/0003-0031(2006)156[52:NHOMIP]2.0.CO;2     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),AGENEOTETTIX-DEORUM ORTHOPTERA;RISK;ACRIDIDAE;THERMOREGULATION;EXPLOITATION;TEMPERATURE;POPULATIONS;MORTALITY;PHENOLOGY;DYNAMICS;Prednisolone,,

This paper investigates the pest management strategy of a prey-predator system model with sexual favoritism. An impulsive differential equation which models the process of periodically releasing natural enemies and spraying pesticides at different fixed time for pest control is proposed and investigated. It is proved that the pest-eradication periodic solution is globally asymptotically stable under the assumption that the release amount of the predator is greater than some critical value. Permanent conditions are established under the assumption that the release amount of the predator is less than another critical value. In particular, two single control strategies are proposed. Furthermore, we compare three pest control strategies and find that if we choose narrow-spectrum pesticides that targeted to a specific pest's life cycle to kill the pest, then the combined strategy is preferable. Finally, the corresponding system with no sexual favoritism is investigated. The results indicate that we can release fewer amount of the predators to eliminate the preys with sexual favoritism than without and any strong sexual favoritism will drive the pest towards extinction. In view of the biological meaning, the sexual favoritism plays a more active role in suppressing insect pests.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  2     Total Times Cited:  2     Cited Reference Count:  37 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1093/imammb/dqn025     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),prey-predator system;impulsive control;sexual favoritism;extinction;permanence;BIOLOGICAL-CONTROL;IMPULSIVE PERTURBATIONS;DYNAMICS;POPULATION;BEHAVIOR;PLANTS;SIZE;FOOD;Prednisolone,,

However, the genetics underlying horse domestication are difficult to reconstruct, given the near extinction of wild horses. We therefore sequenced two ancient horse genomes from Taymyr, Russia (at 7.4- and 24.3-fold coverage), both predating the earliest archeological evidence of domestication. We compared these genomes with genomes of domesticated horses and the wild Przewalski's horse and found genetic structure within Eurasia in the Late Pleistocene, with the ancient population contributing significantly to the genetic variation of domesticated breeds. We furthermore identified a conservative set of 125 potential domestication targets using four complementary scans for genes that have undergone positive selection. One group of genes is involved in muscular and limb development, articular junctions, and the cardiac system, and may represent physiological adaptations to human utilization. A second group consists of genes with cognitive functions, including social behavior, learning capabilities, fear response, and agreeableness, which may have been key for taming horses. We also found that domestication is associated with inbreeding and an excess of deleterious mutations. This genetic load is in line with the ""cost of domestication"" hypothesis also reported for rice, tomatoes, and dogs, and it is generally attributed to the relaxation of purifying selection resulting from the strong demographic bottlenecks accompanying domestication. Our work demonstrates the power of ancient genomes to reconstruct the complex genetic changes that transformed wild animals into their domesticated forms, and the population context in which this process took place.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  180     Total Times Cited:  188     Cited Reference Count:  88 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1073/pnas.1416991111     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),ancient DNA;horse domestication;Przewalski's horse;positive selection;cost of domestication;DELETERIOUS MUTATIONS;SEQUENCE;ANCIENT;DNA;ASSOCIATION;INFERENCE;SELECTION;ORIGINS;ACCUMULATION;NEANDERTHAL;Horses;Genome;Foundations,,

However, in the laboratory, M. elegans captured 12 different invertebrate taxa with efficiency similar to the capture of ants, suggesting that it is euryphagous. For the capture of ants but not for other prey, it used a specialized prey-capture behavior. In prey-choice experiments, the spiders did not prefer ants to flies. We found no evidence for neural and behavioral constraints related to identification and handling of prey. Our results suggest that M. elegans is a euryphagous specialist using a specialized ant-eating capture strategy in which prey specialization has evolved as a byproduct of risk aversion (""enemy-free space"" hypothesis).","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  16     Total Times Cited:  18     Cited Reference Count:  31 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1636/Hi10-56.1     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Prey;hunting behavior;myrmecophagy;mimicry;evolution;JUMPING SPIDERS ARANEAE;CAPTURE TECHNIQUES;HABROCESTUM-PULEX;PREFERENCES;ZODARIIDAE;PREDATION;BEHAVIOR;DIET;Eating,,

Foraging groups may form via different mechanisms depending on the absolute levels of at least two relative spatial scales. I present four group size models for environments composed of two nested patch scales. Second-order patches contain first-order patches that correspond to food patches. Individuals within a given second-order patch are able to monitor their conspecifics' behavior, and the number of individuals attending a first-order patch defines group size. I then test the models' predictions with Parasitic Jaegers (Stercorarius parasiticus) kleptoparasitizing fish from Common Terns (Sterna hirundo). In this context, tern fishing grounds and flying terns that carried fish correspond to the jaegers' second and first-order patches, respectively. The Dispersion and Aggregation models assume that foragers have perfect knowledge of the spatial distribution of food and form groups in conformity to an ideal free distribution. The Producer-Scrounger (PS) and Information-Sharing (IS) models, however, assume that foragers are unaware of the food patches' location and form groups as some foragers join and exploit the food discoveries of others. I used four fitness currencies: probability of obtaining a fish, PF; gross and net rates of energy intake; and energy efficiency. All currencies decreased with group size except the PF currency, which did not vary for group sizes of one and two. Because fitness never increased with group size, the Aggregation model was ruled out. Fish-securing rates of jaegers that initiated and joined chases did not differ. Assuming that initiating and joining a chase correspond to a producing and a scrounging event, respectively, both the PS and IS model then predict that group size should match jaeger abundance. Because group size leveled rapidly with jaeger abundance, both models were discarded. The Dispersion model predicts that group size should decrease with an increase in tern availability when the latter is limiting. Otherwise, jaegers should not form groups unless there is no cost to do so, such as with the PF currency in which solitary jaegers and pairs experience equal fitness. The facts that group size did not reach 1.0 at high tern availability and that it averaged 1.5 when it did not decrease further with tern availability suggest that jaegers may form groups according to the Dispersion model with the PF currency. This conclusion is discussed in relation to the other assumptions underlying the Dispersion model.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  21     Total Times Cited:  21     Cited Reference Count:  86 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.2307/176699     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),game theory;group foraging;group size;ideal free distribution;information sharing;jaegers;kleptoparasitism;producer-scrounger;spatial scale;Stercorarius parasiticus;Sterna hirundo;STERCORARIUS-PARASITICUS;INDIVIDUAL DECISIONS;PATCHY ENVIRONMENT;CAPTIVE FLOCKS;FOOD;LIONS;PREDATION;BEHAVIOR;COSTS;RISK,,

Here, we investigated whether parasites affect behavioural time allocation in a free-ranging ungulate that must apportion time to multiple competing activities crucial for maintenance, survival and reproduction. We examined how experimental removal of gastrointestinal and pulmonary nematodes influenced the relative amounts of time that female Grant's gazelle, Nanger granti, allocated to core behaviours including foraging, vigilance, moving and resting. The anthelmintic treatment reduced female parasite load for similar to 120 days, and during this period, females relieved of their parasitic nematodes adjusted their daily time budgets. At the group level, parasite removal resulted in an increase in foraging time and a decrease in vigilance. This effect was also apparent at the individual level, where treated females allocated more time to foraging at the expense of vigilance. In addition to treatment, group size was a significant predictor of the relative time spent foraging versus vigilant, where females in larger groups allocated more time to foraging at the expense of vigilance. Our results suggest that parasites may induce changes in host behaviour that are of similar magnitude to some of the most commonly studied social drivers of behavioural time allocation.

However, by doing so males may face the associated costs of increased energetic expenditure, reduced foraging time, and elevated predation risk. We investigated the costs of display in lekking male Sharp-tailed Grouse (Tympanuchus phasianellus). We used lek-wide scan sampling to study how males allocated time among courtship display (""dancing''), agonism, foraging, and inactivity in relation to female numbers both within and across days. We also addressed the limited attention hypothesis and estimated visual attentiveness by videotaping 13 males and scoring head turns during these different activities. We found that the proportion of males engaged in display increased significantly with female numbers both within and across days. Additionally, foraging decreased with increasing female numbers both within and across days. Our results also suggested that agonism increased on days of high female attendance after females had left the lek. Males turned their heads only half as frequently during display as during other activities. These correlative data suggest two mechanisms by which display costs are potentially incurred: 1) a reduction in on-lek foraging time, and 2) reduced visual attention to the surroundings.

There was a significant difference in behavior among populations in all behaviors evaluated. A population of a widespread clone (US1) behaved most differently from the other populations exhibiting differences in all behaviors including a greater propensity to disperse.

Rapid development of this fiels resulted in some contradictions in methods and terminology. In this review different forms and levels of social learning are analyzed. Ecological aspects of social learning are connected with diet shaping, fear of predators and mate choice. The first aspect is the most studied but still discussible. Social learning being an intricate component of feeding behaviour matches with innate behaviour, imprinting as well as early associative learning. Investigation of cognitive aspects of social learning going back to Thorndike's crucial question ""Do apes ape?"" are now developing into series of questions uncluding even: ""Do ants ape?"". Elaboration of universal methods of comparative studying of social learning such as ""artificial fruit"" and ""two ways/one outcome"" has essentially enlightened these questions and made comparative analysis possible. Large continuum of displays of cognitive skills in social learning has been revealed in non-primate species. One of the disctussible issues in the role of social learning is distribution of innovations. Many authors have investigated this intriguing aspect of animal behaviour in different ways, such as long field observations as well as laboratory experiments based on ""artificial innovators"" that is specimens specially taught by experimentalists. Many impressive results were obtained; in particular it turned out in contradiction with some mathematical models that individuals in groups are rather different in their psychophysiological predisposition to innovative behaviour. Role of teaching in such different forms of behaviour as shaping of species-specific behavioural patterns and spread of innovations is considered. Although the majority of aminals in wild populations are not good teachers and pupils, some cultural aspects of behaviour were recently revealed, mostly in primates. At the same time some classical results concerning cultural transmission of new patterns (for example, bottle-opening in tits) were experimentally revised. Many problems still remain unsolved, in particular, how spread of innovations may favour prosperity of populations; to what degree behavioural peculiarities of local groups may be determined by processes of social learning; which internal and external factors and under what circumstances invest into social learning in natural environment.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  8     Total Times Cited:  11     Cited Reference Count:  129 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",,INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES;BEHAVIOR;IMITATION;RATS;TRANSMISSION;PREFERENCES;INNOVATIONS;MECHANISMS;AVOIDANCE;HOUSE;Animal Shells;Animals,,

The phytoplankton population is split into a susceptible (S) and an infected (I) part. Both parts grow logistically, limited by a common carrying capacity. Zooplankton (Z) as a Holling-type II predator is grazing on susceptibles and infected. The local and spatial analyses of the S-I-Z model with lysogenic infection have been presented in a previous paper (Malchow et al., 2004b. Oscillations and waves in a virally infected plankton system: Part 1: The lysogenic stage. Ecol. Complexity 1 (3), 211-223). This lysogenic stage is rather sensitive to environmental variability. Therefore, the effect of a transition from lysogeny to lysis is investigated here. The replication rate of the infected species instantaneously falls to zero. A deterministic and a more realistic stochastic scenario are described. The spatiotemporal behaviour, modelled by deterministic and stochastic reaction-diffusion equations, is numerically determined. it is shown that the extinction risk of the infected is rather high in the deterministic system, whereas the environmental noise enhances their chance of spatial spread and survival.

We also investigated how hares in Pennsylvania altered movement rates and resting spot selection to cope with variable winter temperatures. Hares from Pennsylvania had shorter, less dense, and less white winter coats than their northern counterparts, suggesting lower coat insulation. Hares in the southern population had lower pelage temperatures, indicating that they produced less heat than those in the northern population. In addition, hares in Pennsylvania did not select for resting spots that offered thermal advantages, but selected locations offering visual obstruction from predators. Movement rates were associated with ambient temperature, with the smallest movements occurring at the lower and upper range of observed ambient temperatures.

Acoustic eavesdropping can be a key driver in mediating intra- and interspecific interactions (e.g., cooperation, predator-prey systems), specifically in species such as cetaceans that use sound as a primary sensory modality. While most cetacean species produce context-specific sounds, little is known about the use of those sounds by potential conspecific eavesdroppers. We experimentally tested the hypothesis that a social cetacean, Risso's dolphin (Grampus griseus), is able to gather biologically relevant information by eavesdropping on conspecific sounds. We conducted playback experiments on free-ranging dolphins using three context-specific sounds stimuli and monitored their horizontal movement using visual or airborne focal follow observations. We broadcasted natural sequences of conspecific foraging sounds potentially providing an attractive dinner bell signal (n = 7), male social sounds simulating a risk of forthcoming agonistic interaction (n = 7) and female-calf social sounds representing no particularly threatening context (n = 7). We developed a quantitative movement response score and tested whether animals changed their direction of horizontal movement towards or away from the playback source. Dolphins approached the foraging and the social female-calf sounds whereas they avoided the social male sounds. Hence, by acoustically eavesdropping on conspecifics, dolphins can discriminate between social and behavioural contexts and anticipate potential threatening or beneficial situations. Eavesdropping and the ensuing classification of 'friend or foe' can thus shape intra-specific social interactions in cetaceans.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  1     Total Times Cited:  1     Cited Reference Count:  57 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s10071-021-01535-y     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Cetacean;Eavesdropping;Conspecific sounds;Playback experiments;Horizontal movement response;Communication;GRAMPUS-GRISEUS;HUMPBACK WHALES;MEGAPTERA-NOVAEANGLIAE;PREDATOR RECOGNITION;PUBLIC INFORMATION;KILLER WHALES;PLAYBACK;VOCALIZATIONS;RESPONSES;ECHOLOCATION,,

In contrast, how insects respond to this stressor is poorly studied. Field crickets Gryllus bimaculatus use acoustic signals to attract and locate mates and are commonly found in noisy roadside environments, offering a powerful system to study the effects of anthropogenic noise on insect communication. Rapid repetition of sexual calls (chirps) is essential to attract females, but calling incurs energetic costs and attracts predators. As a result, males are predicted to reduce calling rates when background noise is high. Here, we combine observations and experimental playbacks to show that the responses of field cricket males to anthropogenic noise also depend on their previous experience with passing cars. First, we show that males living on highway edges decrease their chirp rate in response to passing cars. To assess whether this behavioral response depends on previous exposure to car noise, we then broadcast recordings of car noise to males located at different distances from the road and, therefore, with different previous exposure to car noise. Although all tested individuals responded to broadcasted traffic noise, males closest to the road decreased their chirp rate less than individuals calling further from the road. These results suggest that regular exposure to anthropogenic noise may decrease individuals' sensitivity and behavioral responses to noise, allowing them to maintain effective signaling rates. Behavioral plasticity modulated by experience may thus allow some insect species to cope with human-induced environmental stressors.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  12     Total Times Cited:  12     Cited Reference Count:  48 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1093/beheco/arz159     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),acoustic adaptation;anthropogenic noise;behavioral plasticity;Gryllus bimaculatus;insect;sexual signals;FIELD CRICKET;GRYLLUS-BIMACULATUS;SONG;BIRDS;RISK,,

This tradeoff is formalized by finding the level of fat that minimizes total mortality (starvation plus predation) in a given environment. A bird is characterised in terms of its level of energy reserves. The bird starves if these reserves fall to zero. In general, the probability that the bird is killed by a predator increases with increasing reserves. We consider two models. In both at each time unit during a day a bird can choose, as a function of its reserves, to forage or to rest. In the forage vs rest model there is only one foraging option. In the foraging intensity model the bird can choose from a range of options, where options with a high energetic gain also incur a high predation risk. We find the optimal level of reserves for various environments, together with the resulting levels of starvation and predation. Unless food availability is very high, an improvement in overall availability results in decrease in the mean reserves at dusk (MRD); in the foraging intensity model there is also a trend towards choosing safer foraging options with lower mean gains. An increase in variability, either as a result of a decreased probability of finding food or an increase in interruptions of foraging, increases MRD. The increase in reserves is not sufficient to prevent an increase in starvation. As a result, reserves and starvation can be positively correlated across environmental conditions. The level of starvation tends to be lower than the level of predation, but the ratio of starvation to predation tends to increase as conditions become worse. In the middle of winter, the days arc short and the nights are long and cold. The optimal response to a decrease in daylength involves an increase in both dawn and dusk levels of reserves. This pattern is also found when overnight expenditure increases but daylength is constant. In this context we show that when temperatures are very low, a small saving in energy can result in a substantial increase in survival probability. The relevance of this result for evaluating the importance of hypothermia is discussed.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  195     Total Times Cited:  201     Cited Reference Count:  76 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.2307/3676736     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),BODY-MASS;FLIGHT PERFORMANCE;PREDATION RISK;WEIGHT;BEHAVIOR;SPARROW;SIZE;POPULATION;STARVATION;FLOCKS,,

However, very little research has examined the impacts of artificial light at night (ALAN) on mammal species other than bats. Using a large-scale citizen science project, we examined the potential impact of ALAN on European hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus) at supplementary feeding stations. Our results show that there were no significant effects of ALAN on the presence, feeding activity or activity patterns of hedgehogs throughout the experiment, although some variations in individual hedgehogs were observed. This suggests that while there was no significant impact of ALAN found at supplementary feeding stations, there could be other costs associated with lighting, e.g., reproductive success, territory maintenance and natural prey availability, which need to be considered.        Abstract Artificial light at night (ALAN) can have negative consequences for a wide range of taxa. However, the effects on nocturnal mammals other than bats are poorly understood. A citizen science camera trapping experiment was therefore used to assess the effect of ALAN on the activity of European hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus) at supplementary feeding stations in UK gardens. A crossover design was implemented at 33 gardens with two treatments-artificial light and darkness-each of which lasted for one week. The order of treatment depended on the existing lighting regime at the feeding station: dark treatments were applied first at dark feeding stations, whereas light treatments were used first where the station was already illuminated. Although temporal changes in activity patterns in response to the treatments were noted in some individuals, the direction of the effects was not consistent. Similarly, there was no overall impact of ALAN on the presence or feeding activities of hedgehogs in gardens where supplementary feeding stations were present. These findings are somewhat reassuring insofar as they demonstrate no net negative effect on a species thought to be in decline, in scenarios where the animals are already habituated to supplementary feeding. However, further research is needed to examine long-term effects and the effects of lighting on hedgehog prey, reproductive success and predation risk.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  2     Total Times Cited:  2     Cited Reference Count:  61 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.3390/ani10050768     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),activity pattern;ALAN;camera trap;citizen science;fragmentation;hedgehogs;Erinaceus europaeus;light pollution;lightscape;urbanisation;ERINACEUS-EUROPAEUS;FORAGING BEHAVIOR;ACTIVITY PATTERNS;BATS;ABUNDANCE;AREAS;MELES;PREDATION;ROADS,,

The animal allocates resources between the competing demands of combating the stressor and bodily maintenance. Increased allocation to combating the stressor decreases the mortality rate from the stressor, but if too few resources are allocated to maintenance, damage builds up. A second source of mortality is associated with high levels of damage. Thus, the animal faces a trade-off between the immediate risk of mortality from the stressor and the risk of delayed mortality due to the build up of damage. We analyze how the optimal allocation of the animal depends on the mean and predictability of the length of the stressful period, the level of danger of the stressor for a given level of allocation, and the mortality consequences of damage. We also analyze the resultant levels of mortality from the stressor, from damage during the stressful event, and from damage during recovery after the stressful event ceases. Our results highlight circumstances in which most mortality occurs after the removal of the stressor. The results also highlight the importance of the predictability of the duration of the stressor and the potential importance of small detrimental drops in condition. Surprisingly, making the consequences of damage accumulation less dangerous can lead to a reallocation that allows damage to build up by so much that the level of mortality caused by damage build up is increased. Similarly, because of the dependence of allocation on the dangerousness of the stressor, making the stressor more dangerous for a given level of allocation can decrease the proportion of mortality that it causes, while the proportion of mortality caused by damage to condition increases. These results are discussed in relation to biological phenomena.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  58     Total Times Cited:  60     Cited Reference Count:  38 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1093/beheco/ari087     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),immunocompetence;optimality;resource allocation;stress;IMMUNE-RESPONSE;TRADE-OFFS;COSTS;RESISTANCE;AVAILABILITY;MAINTENANCE;HIBERNATION;EVOLUTION;Resource Allocation,,

There have been many theoretical and empirical studies investigating the trade-off between these two activities, especially in birds. Previous models of antipredator vigilance assume that all birds within the group spend the same amount of time feeding. However, many empirical studies have shown that individuals on the edge of flocks are more vigilant. Here we describe a vigilance model which investigates the effect of position on the birds' strategies by dividing the feeding area into an inner and outer region. The model examines how various parameters such as food availability and predation risk affect the strategies of individual birds according to whether they are in the inner or outer region. Our model predicts that birds in the outer group are always more vigilant than those in the inner region. Birds in the centre receive a higher payoff in each of the wide range of scenarios that we have considered, and so our model also indicates why dominant birds would choose to feed in the centre of the group; a prediction in accord with several empirical studies.

The analysis of sexual dimorphism presented here assumes that life histories are optimized over three key variables: activity level (or ""effort"") during the juvenile stage, duration of the juvenile stage, and size at maturation. Reproduction is taken to be semelparous (or monocarpic), reproductive success is size dependent, and females are demographically dominant. Juvenile male and female life histories are assumed to be ""structurally identical"" (i.e., governed by identical functions of activity, size, and development time). Under these conditions, sexually dimorphic life histories readily arise when features of juvenile behavior and development are adjusted to maximize r in response to gender-specific selection pressures on adults.        Some conclusions from the analysis are as follows:        1) Seasonal constraints that force males and females to have equal development times cause differences between the sexes in other characteristics.        2) The survival cost of greater body size generates a sex ratio at maturation favoring the smaller sex, consistent with much empirical evidence.        3) The relationships among size, growth rate, and development time can be represented graphically in a way that permits sexually dimorphic life histories to be depicted and compared. Cases considered here indicate considerable diversity among these patterns.        4) An allometric growth function is derived to facilitate graphical and mathematical analysis of body size.        5) The reproductive size quotient, an indicator of reproductive potential relative to body size, is defined and shown to be a significant life history characteristic. Except when mortality rate is strongly related to size at maturation, or when generation time is fixed, the reproductive size quotient should be maximized, and these maxima should be the same for males and females.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  44     Total Times Cited:  47     Cited Reference Count:  74 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.2307/177477     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),allometry;body size;development time;female demographic dominance;gender differences;growth-survival trade-off;optimal life histories;sex ratio;sexual dimorphism;sexual selection;LIFE-HISTORY;TIME CONSTRAINTS;OPTIMAL ALLOCATION;ASYMPTOTIC GROWTH;MALE BUTTERFLIES;PREDATION RISK;DYNAMIC GAME;TRADE-OFF;MATURITY;SELECTION;Sex Ratio,,

In particular, habitat fragmentation generates increased densities of linear landscape features that can impede movements. While the influence of these features on animal movements has been intensively investigated, they may also play a key role at broader spatial scales (e.g. the home range scale) as resources, cover from predators/humans, corridors/barriers or landmarks. How space use respond to varying densities of linear features has been mostly overlooked in large herbivores, in contrast to studies done on predators. Focusing on large herbivores should provide additional insights to understand how animals solve the trade-off between energy acquisition and mortality risk. Here, we investigated the role of anthropogenic (roads and tracks) and natural (ridges, valley bottoms and forest edges) linear features on home range features in five large herbivores. We analysed an extensive GPS monitoring database of 710 individuals across nine populations, ranging from mountain areas mostly divided by natural features to lowlands that were highly fragmented by anthropogenic features. Nearly all of the linear features studied were found at the home range periphery, suggesting that large herbivores primarily use them as landmarks to delimit their home range. In contrast, for mountain species, ridges often occurred in the core range, probably related to their functional role in terms of resources and refuge. When the density of linear features was high, they no longer occurred predominantly at the home range periphery, but instead were found across much of the home range. We suggest that, in highly fragmented landscapes, large herbivores are constrained by the costs of memorising the spatial location of key features, and by the requirement for a minimum area to satisfy their vital needs. These patterns were mostly consistent in both males and females and across species, suggesting that linear features have a preponderant influence on how large herbivores perceive and use the landscape.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  98 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/1365-2656.13633     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),behavioural barrier;cognitive map;habitat fragmentation;home range;landmark;landscape connectivity;movement ecology;ungulates;HABITAT SELECTION;SEISMIC LINES;SEXUAL SEGREGATION;WOODLAND CARIBOU;CLIMATE-CHANGE;RED DEER;MOVEMENT;ROADS;SIZE;BEHAVIOR,,

The main goal is the characterization of symbiotic relations of coexisting species through their mutual influences on their respective carrying capacities, taking into account that this influence can be quite strong. The functional dependence of the carrying capacities reflects the fact that the correlations between populations cannot be realized merely through direct interactions, as in the usual predator-prey Lotka-Volterra model, but also through the influence of each species on the carrying capacities of the other one. Equilibria are analyzed for feasibility and stability, substantiated via numerical simulations, and global sensitivity analysis identifies the important parameters having a significant impact on the model dynamics. The infective growth rate and the disease-related mortality rate may alter the stability behavior of the system.

The brown treecreeper (Climacteris picumnus) reintroduction into two nature reserves in the Australian Capital Territory in south-eastern Australia failed to meet its predetermined criteria for success. This occurred despite prior habitat restoration within the reserves where reintroduction occurred. Low survival of reintroduced brown treecreepers, particularly due to predation by native predators, has previously been highlighted as a key factor in the failure of the programme. We compared bird behaviour and habitat characteristics between the reintroduction reserves and the sites where brown treecreepers were sourced (which support stable brown treecreeper populations). We did not identify an indication of significantly higher predation pressure in the reintroduction reserves in comparison with the source sites. However, our results revealed that reintroduced individuals may be more vulnerable to predation because of an increased flight time to reach a refuge area. This was a result of a significantly lower number of refuge areas in logs and trees and a higher number of shrubs (which may obstruct escape paths and hinder detection of predators) in the reintroduction reserves compared with the source sites. We identified a lower ground foraging habitat quality in the reintroduction reserves because of lower numbers of ant mounds and lower areas of forageable ground. However, brown treecreepers were able to disperse extensively throughout the reserves and settle in areas with generally higher-quality foraging habitat. Therefore, the negative effect of low ground foraging habitat quality would have been most pronounced immediately after release. This study emphasizes the inherent complexities of species reintroductions and ecosystem restoration. Despite experimental restoration activities within the reintroduction reserves, there were still deficiencies in habitat quality. We emphasize that further habitat restoration is required within these reserves to achieve more complete restoration.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  23     Total Times Cited:  24     Cited Reference Count:  87 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/aec.12017     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),brown treecreeper;ecosystem restoration;failure;predation;reintroduction;WOODLAND BIRDS;REFUGE USE;EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION;SUBSTANDARD INDIVIDUALS;TEMPERATE WOODLANDS;RUFOUS TREECREEPER;HABITAT SELECTION;FORAGING BEHAVIOR;PREDATION RISK;DISPERSAL,,

In ungulates, roads can particularly hamper key ecological processes such as dispersal and migration, which ensure functional connectivity among populations, and may be particularly important for population performance in highly human-dominated landscapes. The impact of roads on some aspects of ungulate behaviour has already been studied. However, potential differences in response to roads during migration, dispersal and home range movements have never been evaluated. Addressing these issues is particularly important to assess the resistance of European landscapes to the range of wildlife movement processes, and to evaluate how animals adjust to anthropogenic constraints. Methods We analysed 95 GPS trajectories from 6 populations of European roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) across the Alps and central Europe. We investigated how roe deer movements were affected by landscape characteristics, including roads, and we evaluated potential differences in road avoidance among resident, migratory and dispersing animals (hereafter, movement modes). First, using Net Squared Displacement and a spatio-temporal clustering algorithm, we classified individuals as residents, migrants or dispersers. We then identified the start and end dates of the migration and dispersal trajectories, and retained only the GPS locations that fell between those dates (i.e., during transience). Finally, we used the resulting trajectories to perform an integrated step selection analysis. Results We found that roe deer moved through more forested areas during the day and visited less forested areas at night. They also minimised elevation gains and losses along their movement trajectories. Road crossings were strongly avoided at all times of day, but when they occurred, they were more likely to occur during longer steps and in more forested areas. Road avoidance did not vary among movement modes and, during dispersal and migration, it remained high and consistent with that expressed during home range movements. Conclusions Roads can represent a major constraint to movement across modes and populations, potentially limiting functional connectivity at multiple ecological scales. In particular, they can affect migrating individuals that track seasonal resources, and dispersing animals searching for novel ranges.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  1     Total Times Cited:  1     Cited Reference Count:  70 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1186/s40462-021-00292-4     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Ungulates;Roe deer;Capreolus capreolus;Migration;Dispersal;Roads;Habitat selection;Step selection analysis;Connectivity;ROE DEER;PREDATION RISK;HABITAT SELECTION;ANIMAL MOVEMENT;PATTERNS;TERRESTRIAL;STRATEGIES;DISPERSAL;RESPONSES;DENSITY;Movement,,

We first showed that hares were nocturnal and that activity patterns changed seasonally in parallel with circadian rhythms. We predicted that day home ranges will include suitable resting (shelter) habitats, and night home ranges will primarily include suitable foraging habitats. A hare's night-range was larger than its day-range. On average, night and day ranges overlapped by 36%, suggesting that selective pressures affecting space use were, at least partly, different at night than day. Dwarf mountain-pine was the most preferred habitat in all seasons and was selected both for active behaviour (night) and resting (day) and hares avoided the most open habitats. Exploring the effects of season, time of day (day vs. night) and site, we found that habitat use by mountain hares did not differ between seasons or between the active (night) and resting (day) period of circadian cycle. Also, we found no effects of differences in landscape structure (habitat patchiness and heterogeneity) on the patterns of habitat selection. Hares always preferred the dense, forested habitats, which seemed to provide food resources as well as shelter from predators throughout the year. (C) 2012 Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Saugetierkunde.

BSA is based on the swarm intelligence extracted from the social behaviours and social interactions in bird swarms. Birds mainly have three kinds of behaviours: foraging behaviour, vigilance behaviour and flight behaviour. Birds may forage for food and escape from the predators by the social interactions to obtain a high chance of survival. By modelling these social behaviours, social interactions and the related swarm intelligence, four search strategies associated with five simplified rules are formulated in BSA. Simulations and comparisons based on eighteen benchmark problems demonstrate the effectiveness, superiority and stability of BSA.

However, favorability of a particular habitat feature is likely contingent on such factors as landscape composition, predation risk, and an individual's resource needs. Thus, habitat selection may vary depending on context, and identifying causes of variability in habitat use could increase our understanding of functional aspects of a species' habitat ecology. Clear-cuts afford ruffed grouse (Bonasa umbellus) important escape cover, whereas access routes (roads and trails) and mesic bottomlands are viewed as important foraging areas for this species. We present a study of factors influencing strength of selection (i.e., use-availability) for these 3 habitat features by individual ruffed grouse. We analyzed radiotelemetry data from > 1,000 ruffed grouse monitored on 10 study sites in the central and southern Appalachians. Five sites were typified by mixed-mesophytic forests, and 5 were predominantly oak-hickory forests. Selection for clear-cuts was positively related to selection for access routes, but it was inversely related to selection for mesic bottomlands. Selection for mesic bottomlands and selection for access routes were positively related in oak-hickory forests, but they were unrelated in mixed-mesophytic forests. Clear-cuts were more strongly selected in mixed-mesophytic forests, and within each forest type, use of clear-cuts was strongest by adult males. Mesic bottomlands were only selected in oak-hickory forests, and within these forests they were most strongly selected by adult females. Following poor, hard-mast crops, use of access routes by female grouse increased. Use of clear-cuts and bottomlands increased for some or all sex and age classes of grouse following closure of hunting, suggesting that hunting discouraged use of these covers. Animals typically face a trade-off between survival and condition to maximize fitness, and our observations suggest that (relative to one another) male grouse favor refuging habitats whereas females favor foraging areas. At a landscape scale, grouse in areas having oak-hickory forests selected foraging habitats more strongly, whereas those inhabiting mixed-mesophytic forests made greater use of escape cover. Our findings indicate that habitat management prescriptions for Appalachian grouse can be tailored by forest type.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  16     Total Times Cited:  19     Cited Reference Count:  53 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.2193/0022-541X(2006)70[460:FAHUBA]2.0.CO;2     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),ACGRP;Appalachian Mountains;Bonasa umbellus;habitat use;landscape composition;resource selection;ruffed grouse;strength of selection;HOME-RANGE;SOUTHWESTERN VIRGINIA;SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS;SELECTION;ECOLOGY;FOREST;ABUNDANCE;BEHAVIOR;Fibrinogen,,

We develop a state-dependent oviposition habitat selection model predicting that females of the endangered fire salamander, Salamandra infraimmaculata, will split their larval load temporally during the rainy season and across multiple pools and will adjust the number of larvae deposited according to pool quality. These strategies are predicted to reduce the negative effects of larval density-dependence and limited habitat duration. We tested the qualitative predictions of the model in an outdoor experiment. Consistent with our predictions, gravid females, when allowed to choose deposition sites among pools of different depths, spread their larvae both spatially and temporally and deposited more larvae into deeper pools.

The main activity periods of many mammal species, especially in human-dominated landscapes, are commonly set at dusk, dawn, and during nighttime hours. Large carnivores, such as brown bears, often display great flexibility in diel movement patterns throughout their range, and even within populations, striking between individual differences in movement have been demonstrated. Here, we evaluated how seasonality and reproductive class affected diel movement patterns of brown bears of the Dinaric-Pindos and Carpathian bear populations in Serbia. We analyzed the movement distances and general probability of movement of 13 brown bears (8 males and 5 females) equipped with GPS collars and monitored over 1-3 years. Our analyses revealed that movement distances and probability of bear movement differed between seasons (mating versus hyperphagia) and reproductive classes. Adult males, solitary females, and subadult males showed a crepuscular movement pattern. Compared with other reproductive classes, females with offspring were moving significantly less during crepuscular hours and during the night, particularly during the mating season, suggesting temporal niche partitioning among different reproductive classes. Adult males, solitary females, and in particular subadult males traveled greater hourly distances during the mating season in May-June than the hyperphagia in July-October. Subadult males significantly decreased their movement from the mating season to hyperphagia, whereas females with offspring exhibited an opposite pattern with almost doubling their movement from the mating to hyperphagia season. Our results provide insights into how seasonality and reproductive class drive intrapopulation differences in movement distances and probability of movement in a recovering, to date little studied, brown bear population in southeastern Europe.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  70 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1002/ece3.8267     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),brown bear;movement patterns;Serbia;Ursus arctos;AMERICAN BLACK BEARS;URSUS-ARCTOS;FORAGING BEHAVIOR;HUMAN DISTURBANCE;RANGE;SEGREGATION;STRATEGIES;SELECTION;WILDLIFE;SALMON;Europe;Seasons,,

We asked if thermally-induced changes in foraging costs influence quitting harvest rate (QHR) of mice. We predicted that mice foraging during the winter would have a higher QHR in more costly colder conditions. We conducted our study with wild caught Peromyscus leucopus in an enclosure located in West Terre Haute, Indiana. We assayed changes in QHR using the forager's giving up density (GUD), which is the amount of uneaten seeds reaming in a tray after foraging activity. Each night from January 12th to March 13th, we assigned 4 trays as ""cold trays"" (at ambient temperature), and 4 trays as ""hot trays"" (trays with a ceramic heat element that increased the temperatures of feeding trays ca. 10-15 C). GUDs (and therfore QHRs) increased as a function of decreasing ambient temperature. Furthermore there was an interaction between tray temperature and ambient temperature; namely, on cool nights mice had lower GUDs in the ""hot trays"", but on warm nights mice had lower GUDs in the ""cold trays"". The TNZ for P. leucopus actively foraging during winter may be closer to the environmental average temperature than typically measured in the laboratory. Overall, these results support the idea that QHR is related to an animal's foraging in thermally challenged conditions. We present a unique way of measuring an animal's TNZ in the field using behavioral indicators.

Moonlight can influence the activity patterns of ferrets and, consequently, might influence the efficiency of spotlight surveys used by biologists to monitor ferret populations. We related detection of adult ferrets during postbreeding spotlight surveys to lunar and temporal conditions. We most frequently located ferrets during surveys in which the moon breached the horizon. The data suggested intersexual differences in response to moonlight. We located male ferrets most frequently during nights with greater moon illumination, but we did not detect a correlation between moon illumination and spotlight detection of female feffets. In general, moonlight could facilitate aboveground navigation by ferrets. However, it seems activity under bright moonlight could be costly for female ferrets while they raise young. Detection of ferrets also varied among months. We detected female ferrets most frequently in August September, when mothers increase hunting efforts to acquire prey for growing offspring (kits). Detection of adult female ferrets declined in October, when kits were likely independent of their mother. We located male ferrets most frequently in September October, when males might increase activity to monitor female ferrets and male competitors. Consideration of lunar and temporal influences and standardization of postbreeding surveys could enhance site-specific assessment of reintroduction success and across-site assessment of species recovery progress. We suggest that postbreeding surveys for ferrets should be enhanced by concentrating efforts in August September during moonlit nights when the moon is above the horizon.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  8     Total Times Cited:  8     Cited Reference Count:  54 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.3398/064.072.0207     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),RESOURCE SELECTION;FORAGING BEHAVIOR;PREDATION;COLORATION;MOONLIGHT;MEETEETSE;EVOLUTION;RISK;African Continental Ancestry Group,,

We examined interactions between an omnivorous shrimp and a grazing mayfly, two co-dominant taxa found in Puerto Rican headwater streams, to assess how predator presence may influence mayfly resource use and instantaneous growth in a tropical rainforest ecosystem. We conducted a series of behavioral and growth experiments to determine the effects of the freshwater shrimp, Xiphocaris elongata, on the growth rate and resource selection of mayfly nymphs in the family Leptophlebiidae. For resource choice assessments, we conducted a series of five day laboratory experiments where mayflies were given access to two resource substrate choices (cobble vs. leaves) in the presence or absence of shrimp. To assess for the effects of shrimp on mayfly fitness, we measured mayfly growth in laboratory aquaria after five days using four treatments (cobble, leaves, cobble + leaves, no resource) in the presence or absence of shrimp. In resource choice experiments, mayflies showed preference for cobble over leaf substrata (p<0.05) regardless of the presence of shrimps, however, the preference for cobble was significantly greater when shrimp were present in the leaf habitat. In growth experiments, there were no statistical differences in mayfly growth in the presence or absence of shrimp (p=0.07). However, we measured increased mayfly nymph growth in the absence of predators and when both cobble and leaves were available. Our results suggest that interspecific interactions between these taxa could potentially influence organic matter resource dynamics (e.g., leaf litter processing and export) in Puerto Rican streams.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  2     Total Times Cited:  2     Cited Reference Count:  38 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.15517/rbt.v62i0.15777     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),interspecific interactions;predator-prey;shrimp;mayflies;tropical streams;PREDATOR-PREY INTERACTIONS;FRESH-WATER SHRIMPS;SIZE;HETEROGENEITY;RATES;RISK;EPHEMEROPTERA;ASSEMBLAGES;PERIODICITY;FITNESS,,

We determined toxicity parameters of the fungicide trifloxystrobin (TFS) and examined its effects on predation rate, using a fish predator (Synbranchus marmoratus) and four anuran tadpole species as prey (Rhinella arenarum, Physalaemus santafecinus, Leptodactylus latrans, and Elachistocleis bicolor). TFS was not equally toxic to the four tadpole species, E. bicolor being the most sensitive species, followed by P. santafecinus, R. arenarum, and L latrans. Predation rates were evaluated using different treatments that combined predator and prey exposed or not to this fungicide. TFS would alter the outcome of eel-tadpole interaction by reducing prey movements; thus, prey detection would decrease and therefore tadpole survival would increase. In addition, eels preyed selectively upon non-exposed tadpoles avoiding the exposed ones almost all throughout the period evaluated. Predation rate differed among prey species; such differences were not due to TFS exposure, but to interspecific differences in behavior. The mechanism that would explain TFS-induced reduction in predation rates remains unclear; however, what is clear is that sublethal TFS concentrations have the potential to alter prey behavior, thereby indirectly altering predator-prey interactions. In addition, we consider that predator-prey relationships are measurable responses of toxicant exposure and provide ecological insight into how contaminants modify predator-prey interactions.

In European deciduous forest landscapes, ruts caused by vehicular traffic, typically comprising small vernal or ephemeral pools with variable hydroperiod, are at times used as breeding habitats by some species of amphibians. Previous research shows that in such systems newts move between ruts within a single reproductive season.        The aim was to characterize such movements by means of a capture-mark-recapture study of the Alpine Newt Mesotriton alpestris (LAURENTI, 1768), during two years differing in water availability, and to detect possible sex-specific differences. Movement between ruts differed between years according to sex. In the year with higher pool drying frequency, more females changed ruts than in the year when stable conditions prevailed. Among the adults that moved between ruts, however, the mean number of aquatic patches visited was higher in males. These results show that the sexes can react differently to environmental correlates and that Alpine Newts are well adapted to utilize networks of temporary pools.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  6     Total Times Cited:  6     Cited Reference Count:  44 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",,Amphibia: Caudata: Salamandridae;Mesotriton alpestris;Alpine Newt;amphibians;rut;site fidelity;temporary pond;desiccation;migration;reproduction;between-pool movements;mark-and-recapture method;ecology;behavior;Czech Republic;TRITURUS;PLASTICITY;PREDATION;MIGRATION;PATTERNS;FIDELITY;SURVIVAL;TACTICS;PONDS;Breeding,,

The prolonged production of stress hormones can contribute to delayed wound healing and growth, but little is known about their influence on regeneration following tail autotomy, or exploratory behaviour in autotomized individuals. Here we examined the relationship between stress, regeneration, and exploratory behaviour in Allegheny Mountain dusky salamanders (Desmognathus ochrophaeus) by manipulating corticosterone (CORT) levels via cutaneous patch. First, we measured tail regeneration in salamanders with elevated CORT for 13 weeks after the induction of tail autotomy. Test subjects received a weekly patch to wear for one hour that was saturated with either a low CORT (0.25 mg/ml) or high CORT (0.50 mg/ml) solution. Individuals receiving CORT patches regenerated significantly less of their tail length and volume (versus control), but without exhibiting dose-dependent effects. Second, we used a factorial design to evaluate the effects of autotomy and elevated CORT on exploration within a test arena consisting of low barriers arrayed in concentric rings. Individuals experiencing tail autotomy exhibited significantly less exploratory behaviour indicated by an increased latency to cross first barrier and a decreased number of barriers crossed. Neither elevated CORT (0.50 mg/ml), nor the interaction between elevated CORT and tail autotomy significantly affected salamander activity within the array. Although CORT did not have a direct effect on explorative behaviour, a delay in regeneration attributed to CORT could lead to changes in patterns of movement in autotomized individuals.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  3     Total Times Cited:  4     Cited Reference Count:  82 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.zool.2020.125751     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),stressors;glucocorticoid;corticosterone;amphibian;Desmognathus;PERCEIVED PREDATION RISK;OZARK ZIGZAG SALAMANDERS;CAUDAL AUTOTOMY;PLASMA-CORTICOSTERONE;ANTIPREDATOR BEHAVIOR;LOCOMOTOR PERFORMANCE;FORAGING BEHAVIOR;TAIL LOSS;PLETHODON-CINEREUS;FROG TADPOLES;Regeneration;Urodela,,

Foraging intensity, and hence rate of mass gain, was most rapid immediately after dawn and before dusk. The experimental birds did not alter either mean body mass or their diurnal mass trajectory after a period of 2 weeks when food was made unavailable for 2 h a day at unpredictable times.

However, widespread variation in warning signals is observed across closely related species, populations and, most problematically for evolutionary biologists, among individuals in the same population. Recent research has yielded an increased awareness of this diversity, challenging the paradigm of signal monomorphy in aposematic animals. Here we provide a comprehensive synthesis of these disparate lines of investigation, identifying within them three broad classes of explanation for variation in aposematic warning signals: genetic mechanisms, differences among predators and predator behaviour, and alternative selection pressures upon the signal. The mechanisms producing warning coloration are also important. Detailed studies of the genetic basis of warning signals in some species, most notably Heliconius butterflies, are beginning to shed light on the genetic architecture facilitating or limiting key processes such as the evolution and maintenance of polymorphisms, hybridisation, and speciation. Work on predator behaviour is changing our perception of the predator community as a single homogenous selective agent, emphasising the dynamic nature of predator-prey interactions. Predator variability in a range of factors (e.g. perceptual abilities, tolerance to chemical defences, and individual motivation), suggests that the role of predators is more complicated than previously appreciated. With complex selection regimes at work, polytypisms and polymorphisms may even occur in Mullerian mimicry systems. Meanwhile, phenotypes are often multifunctional, and thus subject to additional biotic and abiotic selection pressures. Some of these selective pressures, primarily sexual selection and thermoregulation, have received considerable attention, while others, such as disease risk and parental effects, offer promising avenues to explore. As well as reviewing the existing evidence from both empirical studies and theoretical modelling, we highlight hypotheses that could benefit from further investigation in aposematic species. Finally by collating known instances of variation in warning signals, we provide a valuable resource for understanding the taxonomic spread of diversity in aposematic signalling and with which to direct future research. A greater appreciation of the extent of variation in aposematic species, and of the selective pressures and constraints which contribute to this once-paradoxical phenomenon, yields a new perspective for the field of aposematic signalling.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  50     Total Times Cited:  50     Cited Reference Count:  428 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/brv.12460     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),aposematism;continuous variation;polymorphism;polytypism;FREQUENCY-DEPENDENT SELECTION;GRAPHOSOMA-LINEATUM HETEROPTERA;POLYMORPHIC MULLERIAN MIMICRY;CORAL-SNAKE PATTERN;HISTORY TRADE-OFFS;INDO-WEST PACIFIC;POISON FROGS;SEXUAL SELECTION;EVOLUTIONARY SIGNIFICANCE;HELICONIUS BUTTERFLIES;Color,,

Species with long reproductive cycles and high parental investment, such as marine mammals, rely on such behavioral plasticity to cope with rapid environmental change, including anthropogenic stressors. We quantified activity budgets of free-ranging long-finned pilot whales in order to assess individual time trade-offs between foraging and other behaviors in different individual and ecological contexts, and during experimental sound exposures. The experiments included 1-2 and 6-7 kHz naval sonar exposures (a potential anthropogenic stressor), playback of killer whale (a potential predator/competitor) vocalizations, and negative controls. We combined multiple time series data from digital acoustic recording tags (DTAG) as well as group-level social behavior data from visual observations of tagged whales at the surface. The data were classified into near-surface behaviors and dive types (using a hidden Markov model for dive transitions) and aggregated into time budgets. On average, individuals (N = 19) spent most of their time (69%) resting and transiting near surface, 21% in shallow dives (depth <40 m), and only 10% of their time in deep foraging dives, of which 65% reached a depth 10 m from the sea bottom. Individuals in the largest of three body size classes or accompanied by calves tended to spend more time foraging than others. Simultaneous tagging of pairs of individuals showed that up to 50% of the activity budget was synchronized between conspecifics with decreased synchrony during foraging periods. Individuals spent less time foraging when forming larger non-vocal aggregations of individuals in late afternoons, and more time foraging when in the mid-range of water depths (300-400 m) available in the study area (50-700 m). Individuals reduced foraging time by 83% (29-96%) during their first exposure to sonar, but not during killer whale sound playbacks. A relative increase in foraging during repeat sonar exposures indicated habituation or change in response tactic. We discuss the possible adaptive value of these trade-offs in time allocation to reduce individual conflict while maintaining benefits of group living.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  17     Total Times Cited:  18     Cited Reference Count:  80 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1002/ecs2.2044     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),activity synchrony;anthropogenic noise;benthic habitat;deep-diving mammal;DTAG;ethogram;Globicephala melas;hidden Markov model;naval sonar;GLOBICEPHALA-MELAS;FORAGING BEHAVIOR;ALLOPARENTAL CARE;SOCIAL-STRUCTURE;DECISION-MAKING;DIVING BEHAVIOR;TIME BUDGETS;RESPONSES;DISTURBANCE;SYNCHRONY,,

A mathematical model demonstrates the existence of a basic conflict of interest between the dominant male and the female. We model the intensity of this conflict, and the pressure to evolve counter-strategies, in relation to (i) the risk of takeover of top dominance by males from inside the group rather than outside and (ii) variation in the relative strength of the dominant male and, thus, expected length of future tenure. The model predicts that dominant males prefer single-male groups, or failing that, prefer multi-male groups with takeovers by outside males. Females, in contrast, generally prefer to live in multi-male groups with takeovers by inside males, but prefer single-male groups if dominant males are extremely powerful. Empirical data suggest that females can control adult group composition, but cannot control either the source of takeovers or relative male strength. The main conclusion is that intersexual conflict in the form of infanticide may over time affect the social system in which a species lives.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  45     Total Times Cited:  45     Cited Reference Count:  62 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1163/156853907783244710     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),infanticide;dominance takeovers;potential fitness loss;polyandry;female counter-strategies;LANGURS PRESBYTIS-ENTELLUS;LONG-TAILED MACAQUES;HANUMAN LANGURS;SEXUAL-BEHAVIOR;MACACA-FASCICULARIS;PREDATION AVOIDANCE;MULTIMALE GROUPS;CEBUS-CAPUCINUS;MALE TAKEOVERS;ALPHA-MALES;Primates,,

This was revealed in experiments conducted in a system of interconnected 1 m(3) tanks with patchy Daphnia distribution, where fish were allowed to feed from dusk to dawn. The decline in Daphnia density was most dramatic in the tank with the highest prey abundance (reduction of up to 90%) as a result of a sigmoidal functional response (in capture rate of individual fish) combined with the rapid relocation of fish to where Daphnia were most plentiful. Adult Daphnia were depleted more rapidly than juveniles, this being most apparent in tanks with a low prey density, where the fish cruising speed doubled, hence the energy gain from small-bodied prey was probably insufficient to cover the cost of post-capture accelerations. A compartmental size-structured population model, which accounts for a predator's numerical response in space and optimization of foraging strategy, predicts less-selective low-speed harvesting at higher prey abundance, and high-speed searching at lower prey abundance, where the predator moves more rapidly in search of aggregations, but the increased cost of post-capture accelerations leads to lower value juveniles being ignored.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  11     Total Times Cited:  11     Cited Reference Count:  54 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.4319/lo.2013.58.5.1621     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),FORAGING BEHAVIOR;SHOAL SIZE;PEG-MODEL;BODY-SIZE;DAPHNIA;PREY;FOOD;PREDATION;SELECTION;DENSITY,,

However, phenological synchrony represents a perturbation from a population's stable stage structure and the ensuing transient dynamics create troughs of low abundance that can promote extinction. Using an ecophysiological model of a mass-attacking pest insect, we show that the effect of synchrony on local population persistence depends on population size and adult lifespan. Results are consistent with a strong empirical pattern of increased extinction risk with decreasing initial population size. Mortality factors such as predation on adults can also affect transient dynamics. Throughout the species range, the seasonal niche for persistence increases with the asynchrony of oviposition. Exposure to the Allee effect after establishment may be most likely at northern range limits, where cold winters tend to synchronize spring colonization, suggesting a role for transient dynamics in the determination of species distributions.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  27     Total Times Cited:  28     Cited Reference Count:  70 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/j.1461-0248.2007.01048.x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),conspecific attraction;Dendroctonus frontalis;ecophysiological model;insect pest;phenology;positive density dependence;seasonality;species range;SOUTHERN PINE-BEETLE;DENDROCTONUS-FRONTALIS COLEOPTERA;CONSPECIFIC ATTRACTION;REPRODUCTIVE ASYNCHRONY;ZIMMERMANN COLEOPTERA;ATTACK BEHAVIOR;TEMPERATURE;MODEL;EVOLUTION;SELECTION,,

The minnows exhibited significant avoidance of traps marked with the alarm pheromone: less than 4% of the minnows that were captured were found in the experimental traps. There was a nonsignificant tendency for minnows in control traps to be larger than those caught in experimental traps, suggesting a possible role of experience or developmental factors in determining the response to alarm pheromone.

Yet human agencies commonly overlook spatio-temporal variations in productivity by recommending fixed resource extraction thresholds. We studied the influence of forest productivity on habitat disturbance levels that boreal caribou - a threatened, lateseral ungulate under top-down control - should be able to withstand. Based on 10 years of boreal caribou monitoring, we found that adult survival and recruitment to populations decreased with landscape disturbance, but increased with forest productivity. This benefit of productivity reflected the net outcome of an increase in resources for apparent competitors and predators of caribou, and a more rapid return to the safety of mature conifer forests. We estimated 3-fold differences in forest harvesting levels that caribou populations could withstand due to variations in forest productivity. The adjustment of ecosystem provisioning services to local forest productivity should provide strong conservation and socio-economic advantages.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  14     Total Times Cited:  14     Cited Reference Count:  77 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1038/s41598-017-06672-4     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),WOODLAND CARIBOU;THREATENED CARIBOU;BEHAVIORAL-RESPONSE;HABITAT SELECTION;BOREAL FOREST;BOTTOM-UP;FOOD WEBS;TOP-DOWN;MOOSE;ECOSYSTEM;Humanities;Humanism;Humans;Prednisolone,,

Our ability to judge the severity of observed behavioral responses is hampered by limited knowledge regarding how subtle behavior modifications in prey fish affect ecosystems. Here we show that anthropogenic stressors affecting fish boldness are not expected to cause population collapse, but rather elusive effects on fish length, population biomass, reproduction and ecosystem state shifts. We use a physiologically structured population model (three trophic levels), well fed with empirical data, to simulate how previously suggested alterations of fish boldness traits due to anthropogenic stressors affect ecosystem structure. Our results suggest that these stressors may cause ecosystem structure effects, such as skewed size distributions, reduced fish biomass and reduced reproduction success, by altering the foraging behavior of fish. However, the specific structure effects depend on where the boldness-shyness continuum change occurs and on the species-specific life stages. The model also highlights somewhat counterintuitive effects leading to possible extinction of predators when the foraging behavior of the prey is hampered. We conclude that anthropogenic forcing of fish behavior may be a hidden mechanism behind ecosystem structure changes in both freshwater and marine ecosystems.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  3     Total Times Cited:  3     Cited Reference Count:  76 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/gcb.15473     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),aquatic ecosystem;behavioral trait;boldness alteration;life history;regime shift;size&#8208;structured population model;SIAMESE FIGHTING FISH;RISK-TAKING BEHAVIOR;LIFE-HISTORY;ANTIPREDATOR BEHAVIOR;FITNESS CONSEQUENCES;PERSONALITY-TRAITS;ACIDIFICATION;POPULATIONS;EVOLUTION;SELECTION,,

To further understand these trade-offs and to evaluate the underlying mechanisms, we examined the responses of juvenile leopard sharks to salinity changes using a suite of measurements at multiple organizational levels: gill and rectal gland proteomes (using 2-D gel electrophoresis and tandem mass spectrometry), tissue biochemistry (Na+/K+-ATPase, caspase 3/7 and chymotrypsin-like proteasome activities), organismal physiology (hematology, plasma composition, muscle moisture) and individual behavior. Our proteomics results reveal coordinated molecular responses to low salinity - several of which are common to both rectal gland and gill - including changes in amino acid and inositol (i.e. osmolyte) metabolism, energy metabolism and proteins related to transcription, translation and protein degradation. Overall, leopard sharks employ a strategy of maintaining plasma urea, ion concentrations and Na+/K+-ATPase activities in the short-term, possibly because they rarely spend extended periods in low salinity conditions in the wild, but the sharks osmoconform to the surrounding conditions by 3 weeks. We found no evidence of apoptosis at the time points tested, while both tissues exhibited proteomic changes related to the cytoskeleton, suggesting that leopard sharks remodel existing osmoregulatory epithelial cells and activate physiological acclimatory responses to solve the problems posed by low salinity exposure. The behavioral measurements reveal increased activity in the lowest salinity in the short-term, while activity decreased in the lowest salinity in the long-term. Our data suggest that physiological/behavioral trade-offs are involved in using estuarine habitats, and pathway modeling implicates tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) as a key node of the elasmobranch hyposmotic response network.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  49     Total Times Cited:  51     Cited Reference Count:  84 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1242/jeb.031781     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),elasmobranch;osmoregulation;urea;Na+/K+-ATPase;focal animal sampling;proteomics;MALDI-TOF-TOF mass spectrometry;pathway analysis;tumor necrosis factor;NECROSIS-FACTOR-ALPHA;THICK ASCENDING LIMB;PORT JACKSON SHARK;RECTAL GLAND;EURYHALINE ELASMOBRANCH;CARCHARHINUS-LEUCAS;MARINE ELASMOBRANCH;HETERODONTUS-PORTUSJACKSONI;ENVIRONMENTAL SALINITY;ATLANTIC STINGRAY;Proteomics;Proteome,,

However, the overall consequences are still hard to predict because behaviour, genetic adaptation, habitat dependency and the impacts of fishing on species, result in complex species' responses that may be only partially explained by simple climate envelope predictions. There is a broad body of evidence that climatic fluctuations are playing an important role in changing fish distributions and abundances, which is discernible against the background of trends in abundance due to fishing. During warm periods, southern species have tended to become more prominent and northern species less abundant. However, the changes in distribution are often more complicated than might be expected from a simple climate envelope approach, partly due to ocean circulation patterns which create invasion routes for southern water species into the North Sea from the south and from the north via the continental shelf west of Britain and Ireland. The eventual population-scale impacts of ocean acidification on fish and shellfish are currently very difficult to predict. However, the scant evidence suggests that indirect food web effects arising from the enhanced sensitivity of calcifying planktonic organisms may be important, and the direct effect on fish sensory systems leading to subtle influences on behaviour with possible population-level implications are possible. In British waters, the lesser sandeel (Ammodytes marinus) is identified as being at particular risk from climate change. Owing to its strict association with coarse sandy sediments it is unable to adapt its distribution to compensate for warming sea temperatures. Sandeels are a key link in the food web, linking primary and zooplankton production to top predators.

In this paper we give an overview of the theoretical concepts in such models. We also review the biological contexts in which Bayesian models have been applied, and outline some directions where future studies would be useful. Bayesian decision theory, when applied to animal behaviour, is based on the assumption that the individual has some sort of ""prior opinion"" of the possible states of the world. This may, for example, be a previously experienced distribution of qualities of food patches, or qualities of potential mates. The animal is then assumed to be able use sampling information to arrive at a ""posterior opinion"", concerning e.g. the quality of a given food patch, or the average qualities of mates in a year. A correctly formulated Bayesian model predicts how animals may combine previous experience with sampling information to make optimal decisions. We argue that the assumption that animals may have ""prior opinions"" is reasonable. Their priors may come from one or both of two sources: either from their own individual experience, gained while sampling the environment, or from an adaptation to the environment experienced by previous generations. This means that we should often expect to see ""Bayesian-like"" decision-making in nature.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  155     Total Times Cited:  157     Cited Reference Count:  44 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/j.0030-1299.2006.14228.x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),GAINING ECOLOGICAL INFORMATION;PREDATION RISK;PATCH USE;FORAGERS;RULES;EXPLOITATION;ENERGY;CHOICE;POLICY;MODEL;Animal Shells;Animals,,

Thus, we expect that the duration of refuge use will be optimized. We tested a key prediction of this optimization hypothesis in yellow-bellied marmots, Marmota flaviventris (Audubon and Bachman, 1841), by providing supplemental food next to their burrows to manipulate the costs of remaining in a refuge. We then systematically walked towards a subject that was foraging on supplementary food or a subject that was not foraging on supplementary food until the individual disappeared into its burrow. We found a significant effect of our feeding treatment; subjects with supplementary food emerged from their burrows sooner than those without it. We also found a complex interaction between our feeding treatment and immergence distance (i.e., the distance subjects were at when they disappeared into their burrows). Individuals that tolerated close approaches emerged sooner when food was present, while those that were intolerant of approaching humans took longer to emerge and emerged sooner when food was not present. Juveniles emerged significantly sooner than adults, while there was no detectable difference between emergence times for adults and yearlings. This is the first demonstration in a mammal that hiding time is sensitive to the cost of remaining in the burrow. A number of previous studies on hiding times have focused on ectothermic species.

When only visual cues were present, larvae responded to both predatory and nonpredatory stimuli by reducing activity (fright response), but did not distinguish between the two types. Fine-scale discrimination of visual stimuli may have failed to develop because larval newts typically live in aquatic habitats in which chemical cues may be more reliable than visual cues, owing to large amounts of sediments and vegetation or possibly to myopia. Late-stage newt larvae that were approaching metamorphosis were unpalatable to A. t. tigrinum, and histological examination of the skin revealed that granular (poison) glands were present in the skin of late-stage but not early-stage larvae. Late-stage larvae did not distinguish between chemical stimuli from predators and nonpredators, which suggests that fright responses of larval newts are plastic and can be modified according to the level of perceived threat.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  87     Total Times Cited:  89     Cited Reference Count:  50 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1139/cjz-78-9-1646     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),PIMEPHALES-PROMELAS;FATHEAD MINNOWS;ANTIPREDATOR BEHAVIOR;BUFO-AMERICANUS;NORTHERN PIKE;TADPOLES;FISH;RISK;STIMULI;DIET;Cues;Prednisolone,,

Animals have to sample them to track their current states, but whether it is economic to attempt this depends on many factors. Furthermore, there are many interruptions and distractions from foraging (e.g. escape from predators, bad weather, displacement by competitors) which interfere with the acquisition of information. We present a dynamic model of foraging in a stochastic and varying environment, under the constant threat of interruption, to investigate this very general problem. A forager faces two foraging options, one of which provides a known and constant reward, the other providing a reward that is not only stochastic, but whose mean payoff varies in time. The forager has to learn which option has the highest current payoff by sampling. However, interruptions to foraging can occur at any time, the timing and duration of which are beyond the animal's control. When there is a small probability of foraging being interrupted, the forager should forage extensively on the unknown option, but as the probability of interruptions is increased, there is a sudden transition to foraging only on the known option. This occurs because interruptions affect both the level of information required to make exploitation of the unknown option profitable, and the ability to acquire and maintain that information. At what probability of being interrupted this threshold emerges is affected by the value of learning about the unknown option and the duration of interruptions. We discuss the generality of our results with reference to the pervasive problem of updating information in the face of different types of interruption.

However, animals can get habituated to human presence after repeated stimulation. We aimed to obtain a first insight into the effect of human observers on the behavior and stress-related hormone concentrations of free-roaming giraffes as well as their habituation process. Giraffes walked further distances and had elevated fecal glucocorticoid metabolite (fGCM) concentration (stress hormone) in the presence of humans, but anthropogenic influences on their distance walked and fGCM concentration decreased with the increase of habituation. The giraffes were vigilant towards human observers; however, the percentage of time spent on observing a human observer did not decrease with the increase of habituation.        Giraffes are an important tourist attraction, and human presence to wildlife is increasing. This has an impact on an animal's behavior and its endocrine correlates. Studies on other species show alterations in movement patterns, vigilance, and stress-related hormone levels in the presence of humans. Limited information is available on how anthropogenic activities alter giraffe's behavior, social structure, and related endocrine parameters. The purpose of this study was to obtain insight into anthropogenic influences on giraffe's behavior and adrenal activity. We used GPS devices mounted onto giraffes to compare the distance walked in the presence or absence of human observers. We also conducted behavioral observations to assess their vigilance and collected fecal samples to analyze their fecal glucocorticoid metabolite (fGCM) concentrations. Giraffes walked significantly further distances in the presence of humans, but the cumulative time that observers were present decreased the hourly distance walked with an observer present, suggesting that the giraffes were becoming habituated. The number of observers present significantly increased the percentage of time spent on observing an observer as well as the number of unhabituated individuals present in the herd. The percentage of time spent observing a human observer did not decrease with the increase of habituation. Last, fGCM concentrations increased with human presence but decreased when individuals became habituated to human presence.

The escape decision-making process has traditionally been interpreted using theoretical models that consider ultimate explanations based on the cost/benefit paradigm. Ultimate approaches, however, suffer from inseparable extra-assumptions due to an inability to accurately parameterize the model's variables and their interactive relationships. In this study, we propose a mathematical model that uses intensity of predator-mediated visual stimuli as a basic cue for the escape response. We consider looming stimuli (i.e. expanding retinal image of the moving predator) as a cue to flight initiation distance (FID; distance at which escape begins) of incubating Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos). We then examine the relationship between FID, vegetation cover and directness of predator trajectory, and fit the resultant model to experimental data. As predicted by the model, vegetation concealment and directness of predator trajectory interact, with FID decreasing with increased concealment during a direct approach toward prey, but not during a tangential approach. Thus, we show that a simple proximate expectation, which involves only visual processing of a moving predator, may explain interactive effects of environmental and predator-induced variables on an escape response. We assume that our proximate approach, which offers a plausible and parsimonious explanation for variation in FID, may serve as an evolutionary background for traditional, ultimate explanations and should be incorporated into interpretation of escape behavior.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  10     Total Times Cited:  10     Cited Reference Count:  64 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1371/journal.pone.0032522     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),FLIGHT-INITIATION DISTANCE;RISK-ASSESSMENT;PREDATOR AVOIDANCE;DABBLING DUCKS;FIDDLER-CRABS;BEHAVIOR;SENSITIVITY;VIGILANCE;STARLINGS;BIRDS;Cues;Decision Making,,

The shift from one attractor to another, also referred to as a regime shift, is thought to occur when a system passes some critical threshold such that the trajectory of the system changes direction. Alternate attractors in population dynamics can also exist, leading to alternate stable states in the population abundance of a species. This study explored alternate attractors in the population dynamics of the Indo-Pacific sea urchin Diadema savignyi and the potential underlying mechanisms that promote its bi-stability. In Moorea, French Polynesia, the local abundance of D. savignyi, a functionally important herbivore in lagoon habitats, occurs in two states: (i) solitary individuals that occupy crevices in low densities and (ii) aggregations of tens to hundreds of individuals. These different states are temporally stable and are not explained by spatial differences in recruitment rates of juveniles. A field experiment revealed that the per capita mortality rate of adult D. savignyi was substantially lower at sites where urchins occurred in aggregations compared with sites at which they were solitary individuals. An additional experiment showed that per capita mortality decreased with increasing aggregation size. Individuals in high-density aggregations, however, had significantly smaller test diameters than solitary individuals, indicating that individuals in aggregations may be food limited. Collectively, the evidence suggests that the two different local abundance states of D. savignyi result from negative feedback loops where high local density can be maintained by aggregative behavior that greatly reduces per capita risk of predation when the local number of adult sea urchins is sufficiently large; sites with few sea urchins remain at low density because individuals are more susceptible to predation when crevices are occupied but there are not enough individuals to form large aggregations. Thus, there may be alternate attractors in the population dynamics of D. savignyi that can produce either persistently low or high local population densities.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  5     Total Times Cited:  5     Cited Reference Count:  56 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/maec.12285     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),alternate abundance states;alternate attractors;coral reefs;Diadema savignyi;regime shifts;sea urchin;REGIME SHIFTS;MASS MORTALITY;POPULATION-DYNAMICS;POSTSETTLEMENT MORTALITY;ECHINOMETRA-MATHAEI;COMMUNITY STRUCTURE;DENSITY-DEPENDENCE;STABLE STATES;PHASE-SHIFTS;MARINE PARKS,,

Stability criteria for the infection-free and the endemic equilibria are deduced in terms of system parameters. The basic model is then modified to incorporate a time delay, describing a latency period. Stability and bifurcation analysis of the resulting delay differential equation model is carried out and ranges of the delay inducing stability and as well as instability for the system are found. Finally, a stability analysis of the bifurcating solutions is performed and the criteria for subcritical and supercritical Hopf bifurcation derived.

Ecological patterns and rhythms such as behavioral and climatic patterns may provide a consistent method for identifying ecologically relevant scales of habitat selection. Using elk (Cervus canadensis) as an example species, we sought to test the ability of behavioral patterns to empirically partition diel scales for modeling habitat selection. We used model selection to partition diel scales by shifts in dominant behavior and then used resource selection probability functions to model elk habitat selection hierarchically at diel scales within seasons. Model selection distinguished four diel temporal partitions following elk crepuscular behavioral patterns: dawn, midday, dusk, and night. Across seasons, model-averaged coefficients indicated that elk shifted from selecting grassland cover at dawn/dusk, to selecting for greater canopy and forest cover at midday, and then to areas with greater herbaceous biomass at night. Top models changed between diel intervals in spring and fall but stayed the same across diel intervals in winter and summer. In winter, elk selected for southern aspects during midday, for unburned areas at dawn/dusk, and for areas burned within 1-3 yr at dawn/dusk and night. In spring, elk selected for northern aspects and for areas burned within 1-3 yr at midday, for areas farther from roads at dawn/dusk and midday, and for areas farther from water at midday. In summer, elk changed diel preferences for fewer covariates: At dawn/dusk and midday, elk selected for areas farther from water and avoided forest cover, and at night, elk selected for areas burned within 1-3 yr. In fall, elk selected for areas burned the previous year at dawn/dusk and night, for higher elevations at midday, and for areas closer water at night. Using behavioral patterns to identify ecologically relevant scales can help identify overlooked habitat requirements such as diel changes in preference for fire history, forage availability, and cover. We show that the ecological relevancy of a given scale (e.g., a diel temporal scale) can change throughout a given extent (e.g., across seasons).","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  12     Total Times Cited:  13     Cited Reference Count:  88 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1002/ecs2.2013     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),behavior;Cervus canadensis;diel;elk;habitat selection;resource selection probability function;scale;season;ROCKY-MOUNTAIN ELK;MULE DEER;PREDATION RISK;CERVUS-ELAPHUS;HETEROGENEOUS LANDSCAPES;MAMMALIAN HERBIVORES;MIGRATORY UNGULATE;RESOURCE SELECTION;SPATIAL SCALES;SUMMER RANGE,,

We investigated the influence of territory defendability on the decision of western buffalo bream (Kyphosus cornelii) to defend an algal garden or to leave their territories and invade those of conspecifics. Fish monitored while away from their territories did kleptoparasitize the gardens of conspecifics. We manipulated the structural complexity of territories through the addition of short or tall simulated vegetation. Increasing the height of simulated vegetation on the territory decreased the defendability of territories but increased their safety for fish; territories with tall vegetation were more easily invaded by conspecifics, but fish returned more rapidly to these territories after being disturbed. In a paired experiment, fish spent more time away from their territories (roving) when tall vegetation was added than when short vegetation was added. However, this effect was influenced by depth, with a greater difference between treatments on deeper territories, and by body size, with a greater difference for larger fish. These results support the prediction that territory-holding individuals faced with a trade-off between defending their own garden or kleptoparasitizing from others adjust their use of these tactics based on the defendability of resources.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  37     Total Times Cited:  37     Cited Reference Count:  34 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1093/beheco/arg023     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),kleptoparasitism;Kyphosidae;resource defense;territorial gardening;western buffalo bream;EXTRA-PAIR PATERNITY;COMPETITORS;DAMSELFISH;MECHANISM;PREDATION;BEHAVIOR;CHOICE;RISK;GAME,,

The threshold policy is designed to play a pivotal strategy for controlling the three species in the FFCM. With this strategy, no control is applied if the density of the prey population is less than the threshold, thus the exploitation is forbidden. However, the exploitation is permitted if the density of the prey population increases and exceeds the threshold. The dynamic behaviors and the bifurcation sets of this model including the existence and stability of different types of equilibria are discussed analytically and numerically. Moreover, the regions of sliding and crossing segments are analyzed. The dynamic behaviors of sliding mode including the bifurcation sets of pseudo-equilibria are investigated. Numerically, the bifurcation diagram and maximum Lyapunov exponents are computed and plotted to show the complex dynamics of FFCM, for instance, it has stable periodic, double periodic and chaotic solutions as well as double periodic sliding bifurcation. It is demonstrated that the threshold policy control can be easily implemented and used for stabilizing the chaotic behavior of FFCM.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  2     Total Times Cited:  2     Cited Reference Count:  48 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1142/S0218127421500747     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Bifurcation analysis;chaos;double sliding bifurcation;Filippov system;food chain model;BIFURCATION-ANALYSIS;GLOBAL DYNAMICS;LIMIT-CYCLES;PREDATOR;SYSTEMS;SYNCHRONIZATION;MANAGEMENT;CHAOS;Food,,

Motion-sensing cameras and chukar dropping counts were primary techniques to evaluate watering patterns. We took vegetative and other habitat measurements at each water source (n = 43) to discriminate use from nonuse sites using logistic regression. Chukars watered during daylight hours with a modal hour from 1200 hours to 1300 hours daylight savings time. Annual patterns suggest limited use of water sources from November to May with first observed visits occurring in June and last observed visits in October. Shrub canopy cover was the only variable to discriminate between site types (P < 0.01). Cross validation showed a predictive success rate of 84%. Significant differences were found between use and nonuse sites in terms of security cover (P < 0.01), but not total cover (P > 0.05). Chukars seem to have a loose shrub canopy threshold near 11 % that is likely due to predation risk. Water sources meeting this threshold received use, whereas those not meeting this threshold did not. Increasing shrub canopy cover above 11 % did not translate into increased water source use. Managers might want to consider annual patterns when setting hunt season timing and structure as well as judging sites for new water developments based on shrub canopy cover. More generally, these results suggest a behavioral constraint on the use of water sources as a function of predation risk-we should expect other species to demonstrate similar behavioral constraints. These constraints must be considered in any effort to determine benefits or impacts of water developments.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  18     Total Times Cited:  18     Cited Reference Count:  39 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.2111/06-040R4.1     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Alectoris chukar;guzzlers;logistic regression;security cover;water developments;ALECTORIS-CHUKAR;CLASSIFICATION;VIEWPOINT;DESERT,,

To quantify factors influencing among- and within-home-range selection of winter range in this population.        We studied individual habitat selection and road avoidance at two biologically relevant spatial scales. We outlined availability extents for 107 individual elk-years based on observed fall migration distance, and based on a minimum convex polygon around winter telemetry relocations. To model the response by elk to road disturbance, we fit a habitat-selection model to each elk-year at each of the two availability extents, and examined population-level and individual variation in space-use. We then evaluated the relationship between inferred selection at the two scales and the functional response in selection.        Roads had a ubiquitous influence on elk across scales. Elk, individually and as a population, avoided roads when migrating to their winter range and within this seasonal home range. Individual elk that avoided roads more strongly relative to the population did so at both scales of analysis.Further, the avoidance of low-use roads decreased with increasing road density. These results support bottom-up habitat-selection patterns (i.e., scale-independent) and functional response in habitat selection.        Overall, using a multi-scale habitat selection analysis, we show that road avoidance is a major determinant of elk space-use behaviour across multiple scales. Consequently, any new road construction or increases in road-use intensity could have detrimental effects on migratory elk populations by restricting space-use.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  27     Total Times Cited:  27     Cited Reference Count:  72 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s10980-016-0451-1     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Alberta;Cervus elaphus;RSF;Availability;Resource selection function;Human disturbance;Scale;Space-use;Migration;Winter range;POINT PROCESS MODELS;RESOURCE SELECTION;WOODLAND CARIBOU;PREDATION RISK;ELK;BEHAVIOR;MOVEMENTS;NDVI;CONSERVATION;MECHANISMS,,

In multi-host systems, parasites may mediate food web dynamics with unexpected outcomes for host populations. Models have been used to explore the potential consequences of interactions between hosts, parasites and predators, but connections between theory and data are rare. Here, we consider sea louse parasites (Lepeophtheirus salmonis), which directly increase mortality of juvenile salmon hosts (Oncorhynchus spp.). We use mathematical models and field-based experiments to investigate how the indirect effects of parasitism via predation influence mortality of sympatric juvenile chum salmon (O. keta) and pink salmon (O. gorbuscha). Our experiments show that coho salmon predators (O. kisutch) selectively prey on pink salmon and on parasitized prey. Preference for pink salmon increased slightly when prey were parasitized by sea lice, although there was considerable uncertainty regarding this result. Despite this uncertainty, we show that even the small increase in preference that we observed may be biologically significant. We calculate a critical threshold of pink salmon abundance above which chum salmon may experience a parasite-mediated release from predation as predation shifts towards preferred prey species. This work highlights the importance of considering community interactions, such as predation, when assessing the risk that emerging parasites and pathogens pose to wildlife populations.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  16     Total Times Cited:  16     Cited Reference Count:  49 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1890/ES15-00337.1     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),British Columbia;functional response;Lepeophtheirus salmonis;model averaging;Oncorhynchus gorbuscha;Oncorhynchus keta;Oncorhynchus kisutch;parasite-mediated behavior;predation;prey preference;salmon;SEA LICE;LEPEOPHTHEIRUS-SALMONIS;SELECTIVE PREDATION;CHUM SALMON;PINK SALMON;ONCORHYNCHUS-GORBUSCHA;POPULATION-DYNAMICS;BRITISH-COLUMBIA;WILD SALMON;PREY,,

Verbal and mathematical arguments predict lifetime increases in the expression of risky male reproductive behaviours, such as fighting, under a range of ecological conditions. Here we explored the relevance of ageing per se to contest dynamics in two phenologically distinct populations of the speckled wood butterfly, Pararge aegeria. We established 160 experimental like-population contests among naive south Swedish and Madeiran dyads, 112 of which we varied the age difference between combatants by 3-4 d. Although this age asymmetry did not influence contest outcome in either population, we found weak positive covariance between the loser's age and contest duration amongst Madeiran males. This is consistent with a slight lifetime increase in aggression because the duration of these aerial persistence contests is a sensitive measure of the losing male's level of aggressive intent. However, the size of this effect (semi-partial correlation = 0.281) suggests age is not as strongly relevant to contest behaviour in P. aegeria as in other territorial butterflies. We discuss the ways in which ecological differences between butterfly species, particularly with respect to predation risk, may have influenced the evolution of lifetime aggressive strategies in this group.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  21     Total Times Cited:  21     Cited Reference Count:  28 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/j.1439-0310.2005.01173.x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),FUTURE REPRODUCTION;FLIGHT PHYSIOLOGY;TRADE-OFF;EVOLUTION;DEFENSE;NYMPHALIDAE;COMPETITION,,

The successful colonisation and establishment of populations of invasive predators in waterbodies may expose the pre-existing fauna to novel predation strategies to which they are not pre-adapted. Despite this, there is still a paucity of information on behavioural responses within biological invasion research. Here we present the results of a series of 24-hr mesocosm experiments that examined the handling times and responses of four Gastropoda species (Radix balthica, Physa fontinalis, Gyraulus albus, Potamopyrgus antipodarum) exposed to physical and chemical cues associated with the invasive crayfish, Pacifastacus leniusculus. We specifically considered four physicochemical treatments: (1) control (no cue); (2) conspecific chemical; (3) crayfish chemical; and (4) physical presence (but confined). In addition, we considered the effect of previous predator experience of the gastropod (predator naive or aware) and additonally assessed survivourship in encounter trials. Handling time was found to vary significantly between gastropod species with survivorship from predation mirroring handling times observed. P. fontinalis required the greatest handling time (average of 58 s) and had the highest survivorship rate. In marked contrast, P. antipodarum were rapidly consumed, with an average handling time of 6 s and no individuals surviving after 4-hr in the encounter trials. Handling time varied by gastropod size but also shell morphology. The response to the physical and chemical cues varied between gastropod species. R. balthica and P. fontinalis demonstrated vertical avoidance behaviour most readily whilst P. albus and P. antipodarum displayed active migration only to the physical presence cue. In most instances, the response was immediate with vertical migration (above the reach of the crayfish at 15 cm on the mesocosm wall) evident within an hour. Predation regime was found to exert a significant effect on the avoidance response of the gastropods. This was particularly notable in relation to the crayfish chemical cue and to a lesser extent the injured conspecific chemical cue. Predator-naive populations reacted with strong vertical avoidance behaviour in response to the crayfish chemical cue, whilst, in the case of P. fontinalis, predator aware individuals reacted most strongly to the conspecific chemical cue. Our results highlight the multifaceted challenge of understanding predator-prey relationships, particularly in the face of novel invasive species, and provide much-needed evidence to begin to tackle this complex process. Gaining a better understanding of such interactions is vital in order to underpin management strategies and to enable evolutionary trajectories in invaded ecosystems to be assessed. Previous predator experience in combination with species identity are important attributes in determining predation risk when gastropod populations are exposed to novel predators and their associated predation cues.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  84 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/fwb.13855     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),biological invasions;chemical stimuli;non-native;predator-prey interactions;prey naivete;signal crayfish;PACIFASTACUS-LENIUSCULUS;LONG-TERM;ANTIPREDATOR BEHAVIOR;TRAIT COMPENSATION;PREY INTERACTIONS;RUSTY CRAYFISH;AVOIDANCE;SIZE;BIODIVERSITY;EVOLUTION;Cues;Prednisolone,,

The choice of venue can influence the outcome and may be associated with trade-offs involving realism and precision.        2. We evaluated these trade-offs in an experiment measuring effects of venue on larval traits of Rana temporaria tadpoles. The design included laboratory, mesocosm and field venues, crossed with two treatments ( presence and absence of caged Anax imperator dragonfly larvae). Realism of venues was evaluated by comparing experimental with wild tadpoles.        3. Venue influenced nearly every trait we measured, but some were more sensitive to venue than others. Larval and metamorphic performance, external morphology and predator-induced plasticity in many traits varied among venues, while behaviour was less dependent on venue. Tadpoles in mesocosms were most similar to those in field enclosures and the wild, although the phenotypic response to predation risk was greatest in the mesocosm venue. The laboratory environment triggered highly distinctive morphology. Precision was not higher in the laboratory than in other venues.        4.

The invasive New Zealand Mud Snail (Potamopyrgus antipodarum) exhibits several behaviors that appear to reduce the probability of predation when the snail chemically detects potential predators in both its native and invaded range. We conducted 2 experiments to determine if these predator-induced behavioral changes come at a cost of growth to the snail. In the 1(st)experiment, we exposed juveniles of 4 different populations (3 invasive and 1 New Zealand native) to plain water and to water with odor from a potential fish predator (Blacknose Dace,Rhinichthys atratulus). In the 2(nd)experiment, we exposed juvenile snails of 1 invasive population to plain water, water with crayfish odor, water with crayfish odor where the crayfish had been fed snails, and crushed snail odor. In both experiments we measured the change in length of the snails after similar to 7 wk. We found that different populations grew at different rates, and that fish odor resulted in snails growing at a slower rate than snails exposed to plain water. We found weak evidence that snails from different populations were affected differently by fish odor. In the 2(nd)experiment, we found that only odor from crayfish feeding on snails resulted in a reduced growth rate. These results demonstrate that the behavioral response to a chemical cue produced by a predator in this system comes at the cost of growth, which is likely caused by reduced foraging. The fact that invasive populations retain the ability to detect and behaviorally respond to predators, despite the growth cost, suggests that behavioral flexibility may play a role in the invasion success of this species.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  4     Total Times Cited:  4     Cited Reference Count:  66 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1086/710107     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),New Zealand Mud Snail;Potamopyrgus antipodarum;fish;crayfish;kairomone;growth rate;non-native;invasive;POTAMOPYRGUS-ANTIPODARUM GRAY;TRADE-OFF;FORAGING BEHAVIOR;LAKE-ONTARIO;RISK;FISH;RESPONSES;DEFENSES;PARASITISM;CHEMICALS;Prednisolone,,

We propose an evolutionary explanation for a link between personality and plasticity based upon how individuals manage uncertainty. Individuals can employ three categories of tactics to manage uncertainty. They can 1) gather information (sample) to reduce uncertainty, 2) show strategic (state-dependent) preferences for options that differ in their associated variances in rewards (i.e. variance-sensitivity), or 3) invest in insurance to mitigate the consequences of uncertainty. We explicitly outline how individual differences in the use of any of these tactics can generate personality-related differences in behavioural plasticity. For example, sampling effort is likely to co-vary with individual activity and exploration behaviours, while simultaneously creating population variation in reactions to changes in environmental conditions. Individual differences in the use of insurance may be associated with differences in risk-taking behaviours, such as boldness in the face of predation, thereby influencing the degree of adaptive plasticity across individuals. Population variation in responsiveness to environmental changes may also reflect individual differences in variance-sensitivity, because stochastic change in the environment increases variances in rewards, which may both attract and benefit variance-prone individuals, but not variance-averse individuals. We review the existing evidence that individual variation in strategies for managing uncertainty exist, and describe how positive-feedbacks between sampling, variance-sensitivity and insurance can maintain and exaggerate even small initial differences between individuals in the relative use of these tactics. Given the pervasiveness of the problem of uncertainty, alternative strategies for managing uncertainty may provide a powerful explanation for consistent differences in behaviour and behavioural plasticity for a wide range of traits.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  133     Total Times Cited:  133     Cited Reference Count:  86 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/j.1600-0706.2012.20339.x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),CONSISTENT INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES;INTERMITTENT LOCOMOTION;ANIMAL PERSONALITY;PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY;BODY CONDITION;RISK;VARIANCE;AGGRESSION;BOLDNESS;ECOLOGY,,

We investigate the local and global dynamics of the model with emphasis on the impact of strong Allee effect. First, positivity and boundedness of solutions are studied. Then existence and stability of the boundary and interior equilibria are presented and the Hopf bifurcation curve at an interior equilibrium is given. The existence of a Hopf bifurcation curve indicates that if competition between the IG prey and IG predator for the basal resource lies below the curve then the interior equilibrium remains stable, while if it lies above the curve then the interior equilibrium loses its stability. In order to explore the impact of Allee effect, the parameter space is classified into sixteen different regions and, in each region, the number of interior equilibria is determined and the corresponding bifurcation diagrams on the Allee threshold are given. The extinction parameter regions of at least one species and the necessary coexistence parameter regions of all three species are provided. In addition, we explore possible dynamical patterns, i.e., the existence of multiple attractors. By theoretical analysis and numerical simulations, we show that the model can have one (i.e. extinction of all species), two (i.e. bi-stability) or three (i.e. tri-stability) attractors. It is also found by simulations that when there exists a unique stable interior equilibrium, the model may generate multiple attracting periodic orbits and the coexistence of all three species is enhanced as the competition between the IG prey and IG predator for the basal resource is close to the Hopf bifurcation curve from below. Our results indicate that the intraguild predation food web model exhibits rich and complex dynamic behaviors and strong Allee effect in the basal prey increases the extinction risk of not only the basal prey but also the IG prey or/and IG predator.

Whether variation in offspring behaviour alters this putative conflict is not known. The objective of this study was to test hypotheses about the extent to which neonatal activity and ecological variables mediate trade-offs between maternal vigilance and foraging. To address these questions we contrasted data from behavioural observations on female moose (Alces alces) that differed in parity, calf activity, and habitat use at a site in south-central Alaska where they are subject to high levels of grizzly bear (Ursus arctos) and wolf (Canis lupus) predation. Our analyses revealed that females with active juveniles were more vigilant (and as a consequence spent less time feeding) than those with inactive young; vigilance of females without attendant young was intermediate. Distance to apparent protective refugia (e.g., vegetative cover) was positively related to vigilance for all calf-status categories, but lactating females spent more time closer to thick vegetation than did nonlactating females. These results suggest that (i) mothers adjust vigilance when young are inactive to compensate for the loss of foraging opportunities during periods of neonate activity, thereby reducing juvenile vulnerability and increasing the overall feeding rate, and (ii) females with young reduce foraging compromises and, presumably, predation risk by spending more time close to protective cover than do nonlactating females. We conclude that maternal trade-offs can be highly labile and that mothers are able to adjust rapidly to environment-specific situations.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  58     Total Times Cited:  64     Cited Reference Count:  59 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1139/cjz-79-11-2055     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),PREDATOR AVOIDANCE;THOMSON GAZELLES;VIGILANCE;BEHAVIOR;SELECTION;COSTS;SHEEP;PATTERNS;MOTHERS;WOLVES,,

Ecological context, sensory inputs, and the internal physiological state are all factors that need to be integrated for an animal to make appropriate behavioral decisions. However, these factors have rarely been studied in the same system. In the African cichlid fish Astatotilapia burtoni, males alternate between two phenotypes based on position in a social hierarchy. When dominant (DOM), fish display bright body coloration and a wealth of aggressive and reproductive behavioral patterns that make them conspicuous to predators. Subordinate (SUB) males, on the other hand, decrease predation risk by adopting cryptic coloration and schooling behavior. We therefore hypothesized that DOMs would show enhanced startleescape responsiveness to compensate for their increased predation risk. Indeed, behavioral responses to sound clicks of various intensities showed a significantly higher mean startle rate in DOMs compared with SUBs. Electrophysiological recordings from the Mauthner cells (M-cells), the neurons triggering startle, were performed in anesthetized animals and showed larger synaptic responses to sound clicks in DOMs, consistent with the behavioral results. In addition, the inhibitory drive mediated by interneurons (passive hyperpolarizing potential [PHP] cells) presynaptic to the M-cell was significantly reduced in DOMs. Taken together, the results suggest that the likelihood for an escape to occur for a given auditory stimulus is higher in DOMs because of a more excitable M-cell. More broadly, this study provides an integrative explanation of an ecological and social trade-off at the level of an identifiable decision-making neural circuit.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  31     Total Times Cited:  31     Cited Reference Count:  83 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1152/jn.00574.2010     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),AFRICAN CICHLID FISH;GOLDFISH CARASSIUS-AURATUS;QUANTITATIVE BEHAVIORAL OBSERVATIONS;CENTRAL INHIBITORY SYNAPSES;MAUTHNER CELL;HAPLOCHROMIS-BURTONI;ESCAPE BEHAVIOR;COMMAND NEURON;PREDATION RISK;SEROTONERGIC FACILITATION;Decision Making,,

The study was designed specifically (i) to determine the natural occurrence of gregarious pupation in the field for different coccinellid species, and (ii) to evaluate the adaptive value of gregarious pupation as a defensive mechanism against 2 types of predators (i.e., cannibals and intraguild predators). In the field, gregarious pupation consisted of a group of 2-5 pupae. The proportion of gregarious pupation observed varied according to species, the highest rate being observed with Harmonia axyridis Pallas (Coccinellidae; 14.17%). Gregarious pupation had no impact on the probability that intraguild predators and cannibals locate pupae. Intraguild predation occurred more often in site with gregarious pupation, while cannibalism occurred as often in site with gregarious pupation as in site with isolated pupa. However, for a specific pupa, the mortality rate was higher for isolated pupae than for pupae located in a gregarious pupation site both in the presence of intraguild predators and in the presence of cannibals. The spatial location of pupae within the group had no impact on mortality rate. Since it reduces the risk of predation, it is proposed that gregarious pupation act as a defensive mechanism for H. axyridis pupae.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  4     Total Times Cited:  4     Cited Reference Count:  47 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/1744-7917.12209     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),attack abatement;Coccinellidae;dilution effect;encounter effect;grouping behavior;Pentatomidae;Selfish herd;SELFISH HERD;HARMONIA-AXYRIDIS;SHOALING BEHAVIOR;CHEMICAL DEFENSE;LADYBIRD BEETLES;COLEOPTERA;COCCINELLIDAE;AGGREGATION;AVOIDANCE;ATTACK;Prednisolone;Defense Mechanisms,,

However, these behaviours create a paradox, as selection seemingly acts on maladaptive traits, and they have often been regarded as cases of mistaken identity, especially in invertebrates. We show that termite males show nest establishment and pairing formation that usually occur in monogamous colony foundation and demonstrate how this contributes to their fitness. We found that pairs of male dealates stopped searching for females and established nests without females, although single males rarely ceased searching for mates. Males in these male-male pairings had much higher survival than single males. Our colony fusion experiment showed that a male in a surviving same-sex pair can replace a male in an incipient colony and produce offspring. A mathematical model demonstrated that the observed strategy of establishing a male-male pairing instead of searching for females is advantageous when the risk of predation is high, even when colony fusion is very rare. These results indicate that, under certain ecological conditions, a cooperative same-sex pairing with a potential rival for reproduction can be adaptive. Our study implies the existence of various possibilities for explaining the adaptive significance of same-sex sexual behaviours. (C) 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

When multiple types occur, the optimal antipredator response level may be determined solely by the probability of attack by the relevant predator: ""specific responsiveness."" Conversely, an increase in the probability of attack by one predator type might increase responsiveness to an alternative predator type: ""general wariness."" We formulate a mathematical model in which a prey animal perceives a cue providing information on the probability of two predator types being present. It can perform one of two evasive behaviors that vary in their suitability as a response to the ""wrong"" predator type. We show that general wariness is optimal when incorrect behavioral decisions have differential fitness costs. Counter-intuitively, difficulty in discriminating between predator types does not favor general wariness. We predict that where responses to predator types are mutually exclusive (e.g., referential alarm-calling), specific responsiveness will occur; we suggest that prey generalize their defensive responses based on cue similarity due to an assumption of response utility; and we predict, with relevance to conservation, that habituation to human disturbance should generalize only to predators that elicit the same antipredator response as humans.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  16     Total Times Cited:  16     Cited Reference Count:  41 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1086/665648     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),multiple predators;general wariness;antipredator responses;referential alarm calls;human disturbance;predator generalization;ALARM CALLS;ANTIPREDATOR BEHAVIOR;SEMANTIC COMMUNICATION;VERVET MONKEYS;RESPONSES;RECOGNITION;DISTURBANCE;ANIMALS;SIGNALS;RISK;Prednisolone,,

We show that if switching does not incur extra predation risk, the animal should have a single threshold level of reserves above which it performs the safe activity and below which it performs the dangerous activity. The value of the threshold is determined by the environmental conditions, implying that animals should have variable 'set points'. Selection pressure to prevent energy stores exceeding the optimal level is usually weak, suggesting that immediate rewards might easily overcome the controls against becoming overweight. The risk of starvation can have a strong influence on the strategy even when starvation is extremely uncommon, so the incidence of mortality during famine in human history may be unimportant for explanations for obesity. If there is an extra risk of switching between activities, the animal should have two distinct thresholds: one to initiate weight gain and one to initiate weight loss. Contrary to the dual intervention point model, these thresholds will be inter-dependent, such that altering the predation risk alters the location of both thresholds; a result that undermines the evolutionary basis of the drifty genes hypothesis. Our work implies that understanding the causes of obesity can benefit from a better understanding of how evolution shapes the mechanisms that control body weight.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  18     Total Times Cited:  19     Cited Reference Count:  68 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1098/rspb.2015.2443     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),obesity;thrifty genotype;thrifty phenotype;intake regulation;energy balance;WEIGHT-LOSS MAINTENANCE;HIGH-FAT DIET;BODY-MASS;PREDATION RISK;ENERGY-BALANCE;FOOD-INTAKE;STARVATION;BEHAVIOR;MODELS;PHOTOPERIOD;Obesity,,

Dysfunctionality in changing the central state appropriately in stressful situations is proposed to be an underlying cause of multiple psychiatric disorders in humans.        Methods: Here, we investigate the dynamics of neural circuits mediating response to a threat, to characterize these states and to identify potential control networks. We use resonant scanning 2-photon microscopy for in vivo brain-wide imaging and custom designed behavioral assays for the study.        Results: We first show that 5-7 day old zebrafish larvae react to an alarm pheromone (Schreckstoff) with reduced mobility. They subsequently display heightened vigilance, as evidenced by increased dark avoidance. Calcium imaging indicates that exposure to Schreckstoff elicits stimulus-locked activity in olfactory sensory neurons innervating a lateral glomerulus and in telencephalic regions including the putative medial amygdala and entopeduncular nucleus. Sustained activity outlasting the stimulus delivery was detected in regions regulating neuromodulator release, including the lateral habenula, posterior tuberculum, superior raphe, and locus coeruleus.        Conclusion: We propose that these latter regions contribute to the network that defines the ""threatened"" state, while neurons with transient activity serve as the trigger. Our study highlights the utility of the zebrafish larval alarm response system to examine neural circuits during stress dependent brain state transitions and to discover potential therapeutic agents when such transitions are disrupted.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  2     Total Times Cited:  2     Cited Reference Count:  52 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.pnpbp.2020.110110     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Predator avoidance;Two-photon calcium imaging;Behavior change;Stress response pathways;Larval Zebrafish;LARVAL ZEBRAFISH;ALARM SUBSTANCE;INNATE FEAR;DANIO;BRAIN;ORGANIZATION;AVOIDANCE;BEHAVIORS;DOPAMINE;PATTERNS;Cues,,

Pitcher (1983) defines a social aggregation of fish as a shoal, with a highly polarized shoal constituting a school. The ultimate causes of fish shoaling have been extensively studied and are well established, with the main causes being protection from predators and enhanced foraging ability. The proximate mechanisms by which groups are maintained are less well understood. Several models exist that examine these decision rules. A common theme to these models is the existence of a region at large nearest-neighbour distances (NND), where an individual will move towards its nearest neighbour. and a region of repulsion at small NND, where the individual will move away from its nearest neighbour. Recent models (Gueron et al., 1996; Couzin and Krause, 2003) suggest that shoaling decisions may not be instantaneous, instead being hierarchical as fish assess the presence or absence of one or more neighbours in zones of attraction, repulsion and neutrality. Here a mixed shoal of creek chubs (Semotilus atromaculatus) and blacknose dace (Rhinichthys atratulus) was examined in the field through video recording and digitization of images. Shoal dynamics were examined both under normal, undisturbed conditions, and in the presence of a simulated predator. By tracking the movements of individual fish over time, we find evidence for both attraction and repulsion zones. But three other novel features emerge as well. First, between regions where focal fish are attracted to, or are repulsed by, neighbours, there appears to be a 'neutral zone', where no consistent response occurs. Second, changes in NND at far distances, more so than at close distances, are affected not only by the position of nearest neighbours, but by the orientation of their velocity vectors as well. Third, the effect of increased fear level of fish induced by the appearance of simulated predators is a decrease in both the average NND and the sizes of the stress, attraction and neutral behavioural zones.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  66     Total Times Cited:  68     Cited Reference Count:  29 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",,decision making;field study;fish shoal;model;proximate mechanisms;schooling;SELFISH HERD;BEHAVIOR;SCHOOLS;SIMULATION;MINNOW;SIZE;ORGANIZATION;AGGREGATIONS;INDIVIDUALS,,

Sexual cannibalism is an extreme mating behaviour which typically involves a male being devoured by the female immediately before, during or after copulation, and is widespread amongst predatory invertebrates. Although the individual-level effects of sexual cannibalism are reasonably well understood, very little is known about the population-level effects. We constructed both a mathematical model and an individual-based model to predict how sexual cannibalism might affect population growth rate and extinction risk. We found that in the absence of any cannibalism-derived fecundity benefit, sexual cannibalism is always detrimental to population growth rate and leads to a higher population extinction risk. Increasing the fecundity benefits of sexual cannibalism leads to a consistently higher population growth rate and likely a lower extinction risk. However, even if cannibalism-derived fecundity benefits are large, very high rates of sexual cannibalism (>70%) can still drive the population to negative growth and potential extinction. Pre-copulatory cannibalism was particularly damaging for population growth rates and was the main predictor of growth declining below the replacement rate. Surprisingly, post-copulatory cannibalism had a largely positive effect on population growth rate when fecundity benefits were present. This study is the first to formally estimate the population-level effects of sexual cannibalism. We highlight the detrimental effect sexual cannibalism may have on population viability if (1) cannibalism rates become high, and/or (2) cannibalism-derived fecundity benefits become low. Decreased food availability could plausibly both increase the frequency of cannibalism, and reduce the fecundity benefit of cannibalism, suggesting that sexual cannibalism may increase the risk of population collapse in the face of environmental change.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  11     Total Times Cited:  13     Cited Reference Count:  41 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1002/ece3.4155     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),arachnid;cannibalism;extinction;extinction vortex;mantis;population growth;population survival;SPIDERS DOLOMEDES-TRITON;ORB-WEB SPIDER;MATE CHOICE;FEMALE AGGRESSION;HATCHING SUCCESS;SIZE DIMORPHISM;FOOD LIMITATION;FISHING SPIDER;SELF-SACRIFICE;WOLF SPIDERS,,

The ability of certain genotypes in a prey population to reach a size refuge from predation may contribute significantly to the preservation of community diversity.

The trade-off of these components is characterized by a specificity parameter.

We examined the extent to which these factors influenced sex differences in the diving behaviour of a size-dimorphic, capital breeder, the grey seal, Halichoerus grypus. Using time-depth data loggers, we examined the diving behaviour of 46 male and 49 female grey seals for 7 months before parturition and mating. Males and females showed significantly different seasonal patterns in the characteristics of individual dives and dive effort. Compared with males, females showed significantly higher levels of dive effort immediately following moult and in the 3 months before parturition. Females also had longer dives (5.5 versus 4.9 min) and spent more time at depth (3.4 versus 2.7 min), whereas males dived deeper (57 versus 49 m). Males dived consistently throughout the day, whereas females showed strong diurnal patterns in dive depth, duration and frequency. The diving behaviour and rates of mass gain by females suggested a pattern of foraging consistent with early accumulation of body energy to support pregnancy and the subsequent lactation period during which females fast. Males, on the other hand, showed diving behaviour and rates of mass gain consistent with a more gradual accumulation of energy stores. Our results suggest that sex differences in the seasonal patterns of diving behaviour reflect sex differences in the costs and benefits of stored energy for reproduction rather than the influence of body size dimorphism alone.

How do animals use the behavior of others to make more accurate decisions, especially when it is not possible to identify which individuals possess pertinent information? One plausible answer is that individuals respond only when they see a threshold number of individuals perform a particular behavior. Here, we investigate the role of such ""quorum responses"" in the movement decisions of fish (three-spine stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus). We show that a quorum response to conspecifics can explain how sticklebacks make collective movement decisions, both in the absence and presence of a potential predation risk. Importantly our experimental work shows that a quorum response can reduce the likelihood of amplification of nonadaptive following behavior. Whereas the traveling direction of solitary fish was strongly influenced by a single replica conspecific, the replica was largely ignored by larger groups of four or eight sticklebacks under risk, and the addition of a second replica was required to exert influence on the movement decisions of such groups. Model simulations further predict that quorum responses by fish improve the accuracy and speed of their decision-making over that of independent decision-makers or those using a Weak linear response. This study shows that effective and accurate information transfer in groups may be gained only through nonlinear responses of group members to each other, thus highlighting the importance of quorum decision-making.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  299     Total Times Cited:  303     Cited Reference Count:  29 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1073/pnas.0710344105     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),behavior;collective decision-making;schooling;shoaling;social;NEST-SITE SELECTION;SELF-ORGANIZATION;SOCIAL INSECTS;ANT;COOPERATION;LEADERSHIP;BEHAVIOR;ANIMALS;SWARMS;Decision Making,,

We evaluated elk (Cervus elaphus) response to disturbance associated with natural gas development in summer and winter, including shifts in resource selection and concomitant distribution. We collected elk locations prior to (1992-1995) and during (2008-2010) coal bed natural gas (CBNG) development in the similar to 498-km(2) Fortification Creek Area (FCA) of northeastern Wyoming, USA, where approximately 700 CBNG wells and 542 km of collector, local, and resource roads were developed from 2000 through 2010. We developed resource selection functions for summer and winter using coordinate data from VHF-collared female elk prior to CBNG development and similar location data from GPS-collared female elk during CBNG development to assess spatial selection shifts. By pooling across all locations we created population level models for each time period (e.g., pre- and during development) and incorporated individual variation through bootstrapping standard errors for parameter estimates. Comparison of elk resource selection prior to and during natural gas development demonstrated behavioral and distributional shifts whereby during development, elk demonstrated a higher propensity to use distance and escape cover to minimize exposure to roads. Specifically, during-development elk selected areas with greater Rocky Mountain juniper (Juniperus scopulorum Sarg.) cover, increased terrain ruggedness, and farther from CBNG roads than prior to development. Elk distributional changes resulting from avoidance behavior led to a loss of high-use areas by 43.1% and 50.2% in summer and winter, respectively.

First passage time (FPT) analysis was used to determine the spatial scales at which foraging occurs within home-range areas.

Results did not support the hypothesis that adult Chinook salmon would hold extensively and migrate slowly through the estuarine lagoon with return trips to the sea and use of the salt wedge for behavioral thermo-osmoregulation in response to high summer water temperatures. Passive tidal transport was not observed as predicted and entry from the sea to the estuarine lagoon occurred during all tidal phases suggesting that conserving energy was not a priority for fish during the estuarine phase of their migration. An unexpected finding was that the persistent pursuit pressure of pinnipeds, especially from California sea lions (Zalophus californianus), appeared to negate the suitability of estuarine lagoon as holding habitat. This finding led to the hypothesis that the risk of pinniped predation was primarily responsible for the brief residence (< 24 h on average) and rapid migration (mean 1.2 km/h, 0.42 body lengths/s) of adult Chinook salmon in the estuarine lagoon, especially given its relatively small size (7 km). This hypothesis will be difficult to test without exclusion of pinnipeds. Thermal records of fish that retreated back to the sea after tagging suggested that use of the marine river plume could be important for osmotic adaption to allow rapid migration through estuaries, which often contain concentrations of predators anticipating the return of migrating salmon. Alternatively, use of the marine river plume could have occurred independent of predators. Fish retreating back to the sea should be considered a tagging effect as downstream movement commonly occurs when adult salmonids are released after tagging. There was no evidence of any other tagging effects or biased behavior by fish tagged in this study. Regardless of the reasons, the successful migration of fish that held for weeks in the sea after tagging indicates that there could be considerable flexibility in the river entry timing of some salmon stocks. Tagging adult salmonids in the sea as they approach their natal rivers is ideal but the associated logistical challenges and expense make tagging fish immediately upon entrance to river mouths the next best option when possible.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  9     Total Times Cited:  9     Cited Reference Count:  50 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s10641-012-0004-7     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chinook salmon;Estuary;Migration;River entry;Pinnipeds;Tidal transport;ATLANTIC SALMON;SOCKEYE-SALMON;ONCORHYNCHUS-NERKA;ABERDEENSHIRE-DEE;RETURN MIGRATION;SEAL PREDATION;HARBOR SEAL;RIVER ENTRY;HABITAT USE;SALAR L,,

It has been suggested that host-parasite relatedness can facilitate the evolution of CBP. A recent model showed that the existence and accuracy of the kin recognition system is crucial for this to occur. I used field data to parameterize the model for the common goldeneye, Bucephala clangula, a precocial species in which CBP frequently occurs and in which a recent finding of nonrandom host-parasite relatedness has been interpreted to support the idea that relatedness and kin selection influence CBP. It turned out that possibilities to detect brood parasitism and accurately discriminate between kin and nonkin parasites are negligible in the species.

We develop a predator-prey model that combines these phenomena, considering variable prey refuge with additive Allee effect on the prey species, with a Holling type II response function for the prey growth function. We use the predator and prey nullclines to determine the existence and stability of interior equilibria. We also investigate all possible local and global bifurcations that the system could undergo, showing that prey refuge and a strong Allee effect can lead to saddle-node bifurcations, Hopf bifurcations or Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation. We have investigated the appearance of Hopf bifurcations in a neighborhood of the unique interior equilibrium point of the dynamical system. The rich behaviour of the dynamics suggests that both prey refuge and a strong Allee affect are important factors in ecological complexity. (C) 2021 THE AUTHORS.

Two distinct spatial patterns were displayed in the same local population, i.e. residential and migratory. Residential annual home ranges were significantly smaller compared to migratory ones using both Minimum Convex Polygon and Kernel Home Range, due to periodic movement of migrants between distinct seasonal ranges. Residents remained in the same area throughout the year and showed a positive age effect on the home range size. While seasonal ranges of migrants were comparable in size, residents surprisingly expanded their space use in winter compared to other seasons. Fidelity to seasonal ranges over the years, especially winter, was striking and comparable in both migrants and residents with increasing tendency throughout the year (37-68 %). Vertical differences in home range altitudes were most obvious in migrants, although in both migrant types, significant descent was recorded during the winter. The longest horizontal movements were recorded in three young stags emigrating to neighbouring mountain ranges (30, 47 and 65 km). Because 45 % of the population seems to be migratory, the data support importance of large-scale hunting management established in Slovakia in 2009.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  22     Total Times Cited:  25     Cited Reference Count:  68 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s10344-014-0874-4     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Large herbivores;Radio-tracking;Spatial behaviour;Ungulates;Slovakia;HABITAT SELECTION;PLANT PHENOLOGY;BODY-WEIGHT;CAPREOLUS-CAPREOLUS;SEASONAL MIGRATION;PREDATION RISK;WOLF PREDATION;NATIONAL-PARK;UNGULATE;WINTER,,

Our model may be applied to prey-predator systems as well as to certain host-parasite or parasitoid systems. A situation in which population P affects, the spatial distribution of population N is considered. We deal with a heterogeneous environment composed of two spatial patches: population P lives only in patch I, while individuals belonging to population N migrate between patch 1 and patch 2, which may be a refuge. Therefore they are divided into two patch sub-populations and can migrate according to different migration laws. We make the assumption that the patch change is fast, whereas the growth and interaction processes are slower. We take advantage of the two time scales to perform aggregation methods in order to obtain a global model describing the time evolution of the total populations, at a slow time scale. At first, a migration law which is independent on population P density is considered. In this case the global model is equivalent to the local one, and under certain conditions, population P always gets extinct. Then, the same model, but in which individuals belonging to population N leave patch 1 proportionally to population P density, is studied. This particular behavioral choice leads to a dynamically richer global system, which favors stability and population coexistence. Finally, we study a third example corresponding to the addition of an aggregative behavior of population N on patch 1. This leads to a more complicated situation in which, according to initial conditions, the global system is described by two different aggregated models. Under certain conditions on parameters a stable limit cycle occurs, leading to periodic variations of the total population densities, as well as of the local densities on the spatial patches.

Traditionally, biotic constraints such as predation risk and competition have been proposed to explain this inconsistency, leaving aside the possible role of abiotic factors. Here we documented how wind affects the load size of a central-place forager (leaf-cutting ants) through a mathematical model including the whole foraging process. The model showed that as wind speed at ground level increased from 0 to 2 km/h, load size decreased from 91 to 30 mm(2), a prediction that agreed with empirical data from windy zones, highlighting the relevance of considering abiotic factors to predict foraging behavior. Furthermore, wind reduced the range of load sizes that workers should select to maintain a similar rate of food intake and decreased the foraging rate by similar to 70% when wind speed increased 1 km/h. These results suggest that wind could reduce the fitness of colonies and limit the geographic distribution of leaf-cutting ants. The developed model offers a complementary explanation for why load size in central-place foragers may not fit theoretical predictions and could serve as a basis to study the effects of other abiotic factors that influence foraging.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  5     Total Times Cited:  5     Cited Reference Count:  60 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1086/692707     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),environmental factors;foraging rate;mathematical model;resource accumulation;LEAF-CUTTING ANTS;ANTENNAL LOBE;TRAIL GRADIENT;ATTA;RESPONSES;BEHAVIOR;MECHANISMS;WORKERS;FIELD;Respiration,,

Here we record the structure and dynamics of fish shoals (Pseudomugil signifer) in 3D both with and without live predators (Philypnodon grandiceps) under controlled laboratory conditions. Shoals adopted two distinct types of shoal structure: ""sphere-like"" geometries at depth and flat ""carpet-like"" structures at the water's surface, with shoals becoming more compact in both horizontal and vertical planes in the presence of a predator. The predators actively stalked and attacked the prey, with attacks being initiated when the shoals were not in their usual configurations. These attacks caused the shoals to break apart, but shoal reformation was rapid and involved individuals adjusting their positions in both horizontal and vertical dimensions. Our analyses revealed that targeted prey were more isolated from other conspecifics, and were closer in terms of distance and direction to the predator compared to non-targeted prey. Moreover, which prey were targeted could largely be identified based on individuals' positions from a single plane. This highlights that previously proposed 2D theoretical models and their assumptions appear valid when considering how predators target groups in 3D. Our work provides experimental, and not just anecdotal, support for classic theoretical predictions and also lends new insights into predatory-prey interactions in three-dimensional environments.

It finds that some of the previously criticized assumptions of theoretical models remain valid when considering how predators attack prey in 3D.

Many species rely on chemosensory cues to identify predators and organize defenses specific to particular types of predators. A large body of research in this area has focused on lizards and snakes because they have heightened chemical senses and have been shown to identify predators using chemical cues alone. We designed an experiment to examine the antipredator behavior of a common desert-dwelling nocturnal lizard, the Banded Gecko (Coleonyx variegates), towards snake predators that use different hunting techniques: active-hunting Glossy Snakes (Arizona elegans) and ambush-hunting rattlesnakes (Crotalus cerastes). We exposed Banded Geckos to chemical cues from these two predators and measured a series of behavioral responses including tail displays, time spent investigating chemical cues while actively moving, and time spent in refugia. Geckos exhibited clear antipredator behaviors toward both snakes but spent more time actively moving in response to glossy snake cues. Because rattlesnakes use ambush strategies to capture prey whereas glossy snakes are active searchers, remaining in place while assessing rattlesnake cues is probably less risky than when assessing glossy snake cues. Our findings indicate that Banded Geckos can not only discriminate among different predatory snake species based on chemical cues alone, but they also appear to adjust their antipredator responses in a predator-specific manner.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  39 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1670/19-131     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),CHEMICAL CUES;SIDEWINDER RATTLESNAKES;CROTALUS CERASTES;MOUNTAIN LIZARD;SNAKE PREDATORS;SQUAMATA;RECOGNITION;AVOIDANCE;ECOLOGY;RISK;Cues;Prednisolone,,

In the Serengeti ecosystem, Tanzania, illegal hunting is a serious concern for wildlife management, and in this study we investigated if density, demography and behaviour can be used as indicators of human exploitation. We used impala (Aepycerus melampus) as a model species to study human exploitation inside and outside a strictly protected area. Over a six month period, a total of 2050 km of transects were driven in the different protected areas (National Park, Game Reserve, Open Area). Densities were estimated by using distance sampling and the partially protected areas were found to have significantly lower densities (4.3 ind/km(2)) than the National Park (15.3 ind/km(2)). A variation in density between different sections within the National Park was also found. However, we found no differences in group sizes. Moreover, the sex-ratio was more skewed towards females in the partially protected areas and in sections within the National Park close to villages. In addition, impalas showed higher alertness levels, and longer flight initiation distance to an approaching human in the partially protected areas compared to the National Park. The present harvest levels by illegal hunting in the study area are most likely the cause of the observed differences. Our results suggest that density, demography and behaviour can be used as indicators of human exploitation, but that this probably varies according to local hunting pressure. Furthermore, it could be expected that the results obtained in this study might reflect the state of other ungulates in the area, which raises concern whether management objectives for the buffer zones of Serengeti National Park are met.

Here, we test experimentally whether stochasticity in economic losses also affects the value of reputation in indirect reciprocity, a type of cooperation that is very typical for humans. We used a repeated helping game with observers. One subject (the ""Unlucky"") lost some money, another one (the ""Passer-by"") could reduce this loss by accepting a cost to herself, thereby building up a reputation that could be used by others in later interactions. The losses were either stable or stochastic, but the average loss over time and the average efficiency gains of helping were kept constant in both treatments. We found that players with a reputation of being generous were generally more likely to receive help by others, such that investing into a good reputation generated long-term benefits that compensated for the immediate costs of helping. Helping frequencies were similar in both treatments, but players with a reputation to be selfish lost more resources under stochastic conditions. Hence, returns on investment were steeper when losses varied than when they did not.

In line with long held life-history theory, we found strong support for both an evolved and proximate response to food availability for young. We also found evidence consistent with predictions that proximate level experiential nest predation influences seasonal declines in clutch size. Finally, older females appear to invest more in reproduction (initiate nests earlier and lay larger clutches) and choose better territories than younger females.

We carried out two different types of controlled gunshot experiments - one measuring the distance at which murres first reacted to gunshots (flight initiation distance, 'FID') and one measuring the proportion of murres remaining in the colony during and after repeated gunshots (20 gunshots within 78 min). FID varied from 0.5 to 5 km. The proportion of murres remaining in the plot after the repeated gunshots ranged from 0.44 to 0.8. Mainly murres not attending offspring took off when disturbed by gunshots, but occasionally also birds incubating their egg or brooding their chick took off. We found that density of seabirds (murres and black-legged kittiwakes Rissa tridanyk) at the plot area scale was the best explaining factor for FID, and to some extent also for the effect of repeated gunshots, both for disturbed and undisturbed colonies. Murres in denser colonies reacted earlier (had larger FIDs) and somewhat more strongly (higher proportions fleeing) to gunshots than murres in less densely populated colonies. FID clearly showed that the current legislation in Greenland regulating gunshots near breeding colonies is insufficient. We provide some recommendations for improved management of a popular game species under pressure.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  77 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.2981/wlb.00752     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),flight initiation distance;gunshot disturbance;seabird colonies;thick-billed murre;Uria lomvia;wildlife;MURRE URIA-LOMVIA;TIME-LAPSE PHOTOGRAPHY;THICK-BILLED MURRES;AUDITORY RISK;GROUP-SIZE;PREDATORS;HABITUATION;RESPONSES;BEHAVIOR;COSTS,,

The potential role of occasional gluts of food in determining fat-storage strategies for avoiding mortality have been overlooked, even though animals experienced such conditions in the recent evolutionary past and may follow the same strategies in the modern environment. Humans, domestic, and captive animals in the developed world are exposed to a surplus of calorie-rich food, conditions characterised as 'constant-glut'. Here, we use a mathematical model to demonstrate that obesity-related mortality from poor health in a constant-glut environment should equal the average mortality rate in the 'pre-modern' environment when predation risk was more closely linked with foraging. It should therefore not be surprising that animals exposed to abundant food often over-eat to the point of ill-health. Our work suggests that individuals tend to defend a given excessive level of reserves because this level was adaptive when gluts were short-lived. The model predicts that mortality rate in constant-glut conditions can increase as the assumed health cost of being overweight decreases, meaning that any adaptation that reduced such health costs would have counter-intuitively led to an increase in mortality in the modern environment. Taken together, these results imply that efforts to reduce the incidence of obesity that are focussed on altering individual behaviour are likely to be ineffective because modern, constant-glut conditions trigger previously adaptive behavioural responses.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  5     Total Times Cited:  5     Cited Reference Count:  57 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1371/journal.pone.0141811     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),PSYCHOSOCIAL STRESS;ENERGY-BALANCE;PREDATION RISK;TRADE-OFF;STARVATION;EPIDEMIC;WEIGHT;FAT;METAANALYSIS;PERSPECTIVE;Animal Shells;Animals;Obesity;Food,,

In landscapes fragmented by human activity, species whose home ranges ordinarily consist of continuous habitat in pristine environments may be forced to forage among multiple smaller habitat patches embedded in an inhospitable environment. Furthermore, foragers often must decide whether to traverse a heterogeneous suite of landscape elements that differ in risk of predation or energetic costs. We modeled population consequences of foraging decisions for animals occupying patches embedded in a heterogeneous landscape. In our simulations, animals were allowed to use three different rules for moving between patches: a) optimal selection resulting from always choosing the least-cost path; b) random selection of a movement path; and c) probabilistic selection in which path choice was proportional to an animal's probability of survival while traversing the path. The resulting distribution of the population throughout the landscape was dependent on the movement rule used. Least-cost movement rules (a) produced landscapes that contained the highest average density of consumers per patch. However, optimal movement resulted in an all-or-none pattern of occupancy and a coupling of occupied patches into pairs that effectively reduced the population to a set of sub-populations. Random and probabilistic rules, (b and c), in relatively safe landscapes produced similar average densities and 100% occupancy of patches. However, as the level of risk associated with travel between patches increased, random movement resulted in an all-or-none occupancy pattern while occupied patches in probabilistic populations went extinct independently of the other patches. Our results demonstrate strong effects of inter-patch heterogeneity and movement decisions on population dynamics, and suggest that models investigating the persistence of species in complex landscapes should take into account the effects of the intervening landscape on behavioral decisions affecting animal movements between patches.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  48     Total Times Cited:  49     Cited Reference Count:  46 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1034/j.1600-0706.2003.12418.x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),PREDATION RISK;HABITAT FRAGMENTATION;METAPOPULATION DYNAMICS;MATRIX;SPEED;LOCOMOTION;OCCUPANCY;PATTERNS;ECOLOGY;QUALITY,,

However, in some species, homing and movement behaviors may undermine the success of translocation efforts. For the federally protected Agassiz's desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii), translocation is a strategy used to manage declining populations, yet homing behavior in this species is poorly understood. To explore homing behavior and movement patterns after translocation, we radio tracked 80 tortoises during a 2-phase experimental translocation. Phase 1 included 40 tortoises that were translocated, then monitored for a period of 37 days (21 Sep-28 Oct 2009), and phase 2 included a different group of 40 tortoises that were translocated and then monitored for 186 days (13 Apr-20 Oct 2010). In both phases, we assigned tortoises randomly to 1 of 3 treatment groups: translocated (displaced 2, 5, or 8km from their source location), handling control, or control. After translocation, 20% of the translocated tortoises were able to navigate to their source location, and translocation distance had an effect on their ability to navigate home. We found 44% of tortoises in the 2-km translocated group returned home; 1 tortoise in the 5-km group, and no tortoises in the 8-km translocated group returned. The time required to reach home ranged from 5 to 37 days for the 2-km group, and 34 days for the 5-km group. We deemed tortoises to have homed successfully if they returned to their source location within 37 days of translocation as this reflected the duration of phase 1 and allowed for a balanced comparison between the 2 phases. We found that translocated tortoises moved at least 1.5 times more overall than the control groups, with some individuals moving >10km from the translocation site. These patterns persisted even after accounting for seasonal and sex differences in distance traveled. By identifying homing behaviors and quantifying post-translocation movement patterns, this experiment addressed a key data gap in tortoise behavior that may limit the efficacy of tortoise translocation efforts. Our results point to the need to account for behavioral responses of tortoises to minimize risk to translocated individuals and maximize the success of translocation projects.

Although the benefits from this effect vary among environmental contexts and through time, it has been the common explanation for high species abundance in complex habitats. We hypothesized that oviposition habitat selection for structural complexity depends on the expected trophic function of the progeny. In Salamandra infraimmaculata larvae, expected trophic function is dictated by their sequence of deposition. First cohorts cannibalize later-arriving cohorts, while all compete for shared prey resources. In a mesocosm experiment, we show that gravid salamanders facing conspecific-free pools preferred structurally simple habitats (no rocks), while females facing only pools with older conspecific larvae preferred complex habitats (with rocks). Context-dependent preference of habitat complexity for managing food/safety trade-offs may be extended from classic foraging patch decisions to breeding habitat selection. These trade-offs vary with dynamic larval processes such as priority effects and ontogenetic diet shifts, potentially leading to complex maternal parturition behaviours.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  29     Total Times Cited:  29     Cited Reference Count:  36 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/j.1461-0248.2009.01371.x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Complex life cycles;discrete habitats;foraging rate;intercohort priority effects;intraguild predation;intraspecific competition;larviposition site selection;risk of predation;spatial heterogeneity;temporary pools;SALAMANDRA-SALAMANDRA;INTRAGUILD PREDATION;TRADE-OFF;FOOD;OVIPOSITION;PREY;REFUGES;DENSITY;LARVAE;COVER,,

Found in eastern Africa, this large rodent is thought to defend against predation by coating specialized hairs along its sides with cardenolide toxins from the poison arrow tree, Acokanthera schimperi. To better understand the ecology of this unusual poisonous mammal, we used camera traps, livetrapping, and captive behavioral observations, to study L. imhausi in central Kenya. Although crested rats were rarely detected with camera traps, 25 individuals were caught in live traps, with estimated densities of up to 15 rats/km(2) at one of nine trapping sites. Trapping records and behavioral observations suggest that L. imhausi live in male-female pairs, with juveniles that might exhibit delayed dispersal. We observed chewing of A. schimperi and/or anointing in 10 of 22 individuals, confirming the previous poison sequestration observation. We monitored crested rat activity using cameras and found that chewing on A. schimperi and cardenolide exposure had no effect on feeding, movement, or total activity. One crested rat also fed on milkweed (Gomphocarpus physocarpus; Gentaniales: Apocynaceae), but did not anoint with this cardenolide containing plant. This observation, combined with L. imhausi's selective use of A. schimperi, suggests the potential for use of alternative poison sources. This research provides novel insight into the ecology of L. imhausi, while also suggesting that more field observations, feeding trials, and chemical analyses are needed to understand their behavior and physiology. Furthermore, their complex social interactions, slow life history, and fragmented populations suggest that L. imhausi could be at risk of decline.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  3     Total Times Cited:  3     Cited Reference Count:  54 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1093/jmammal/gyaa127     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Acokanthera;behavior;camera trap;cardenolide;cardiac glycoside;conservation;crested rat;monogamy;natural history;toxin sequestration;CAMERA TRAP;ORGANIZATION;PRINCIPLES;MONOGAMY;PATTERNS;RODENTIA;MAMMALS;FOREST;Rats,,

Variations in the frequency of fission and fusion can also reveal an individual's response to environmental changes. As fission-fusion group dynamics influence the risk of disease transmission, measuring it accurately may have implications for population management. Here, we extend a method to assess the frequency of fission and fusion from continuous monitoring of group composition. The former method was based on the variation in group size (i.e., party/subgroup size) within which marked individuals were successively recorded. Upon validation of the method here, we propose a correction, using the coefficient of variation in group size instead of the variation in group size. We performed our study on an enclosed herd of reindeer, Rangifer tarandus. All reindeer were tracked using Global Positioning System (GPS) collars and followed by direct observations. GPS collars allowed us to obtain accurate measures of the frequency of fission and fusion that we used to validate our models. The resulting method best described the temporal variation in fission and fusion frequency without the confounding effect of the variation in group size. This method can easily be applied to other populations where some individuals can be recognized and their group size repeatedly recorded. It will also help in quantifying the 2nd dimension of the fission-fusion group dynamics: the variation in group size.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  6     Total Times Cited:  6     Cited Reference Count:  46 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1093/jmammal/gyv084     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),caribou;fission-fusion;self-organization;sociality;ungulates;SOCIAL-ORGANIZATION;GROUP-DYNAMICS;POPULATION-DENSITY;HABITAT SELECTION;HERD SIZE;PREDATION;SUBGROUP;BEHAVIOR,,

It is assumed that predators exclusively eat infected prey, in agreement with the hypothesis that the infection weakens the prey, making it available for predation otherwise we assume that the predator has essentially no access to healthy prey of the same species. Furthermore, the movement of predators is described by a non-local convolution of the density of infected prey as proposed in [R.M. Colombo and E. Rossi, Commun. Math. Sci., 13 (2015), 369-400]. The resulting convection-diffusion-reaction system of three partial differential equations for the densities of susceptible and infected prey and predators is solved by an efficient method that combines weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) reconstructions and an implicit-explicit Runge-Kutta (IMEX-RK) method for time stepping.

We investigated whether the observed trophic cascade might have a behavioral basis by exploring environmental factors influencing the movements of 13 female elk equipped with GPS radio collars. We developed a simple statistical approach that can unveil the concurrent influence of several environmental features on animal movements. Paths of elk traveling on their winter range were broken down into steps, which correspond to the straight-line segment between successive locations at 5-hour intervals. Each observed step was paired with 200 random steps having the same starting point, but differing in length and/or direction. Comparisons between the characteristics of observed and random steps using conditional logistic regression were used to model environmental features influencing movement patterns. We found that elk movements were influenced by multiple factors, such as the distance from roads, the presence of a steep slope along the step, and the cover type in which they ended. The influence of cover type on elk movements depended on the spatial distribution of wolves across the northern winter range of the park. In low wolf-use areas, the relative preference for end point locations of steps followed: aspen stands > open areas > conifer forests. As the risks of wolf encounter increased, the preference of elk for aspen stands gradually decreased, and selection became strongest for steps ending in conifer forests in high wolf-use areas. Our study clarifies the behavioral mechanisms involved in the trophic cascade of Yellowstone's wolf-elk-aspen system: elk respond to wolves on their winter range by a shift in habitat selection, which leads to local reductions in the use of aspen by elk.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  770     Total Times Cited:  786     Cited Reference Count:  72 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1890/04-0953     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),aspen;Canis lupus;Cervus canadensis;conditional logistic regression;elk;habitat selection;movement analysis;Populus tremuloides;roads;robust variance;trophic cascade;wolf;HABITAT SELECTION;PREDATION RISK;PATCH USE;ASPEN;LANDSCAPE;MOOSE;DISPERSAL;VIGILANCE;PATTERNS;BISON,,

During 2002-2008, we used both video-monitoring of natural nests and direct observations of predation to identify nest predators of open-cup nesting riparian songbirds along tributaries of Mono Lake, California. Video cameras at 50 nests of 3 songbird species and direct observations of additional nests confirmed 10 distinct nest-predator species and suggested one additional species. Video-monitored nests experienced reduced predation rates, and video observations mainly captured nestling predation, even though predation rates were higher for non-video-monitored nests during the egg period. These findings suggest cameras may have missed some predators. By supplementing video records with field observations, we reduced the likelihood of excluding species from our predator list that substantially impact fitness due to camera-related biases. No single predator species emerged as predominantly important for shaping avian fitness. Nevertheless, we frequently observed garter snakes (Thamnophis sp.) depredating nestlings and Brown-headed Cowbirds (Molothrus ater) depredating eggs. Corvids and rodents were also identified as potentially frequent groups of nest predators. Video cameras recorded partial predation by 5 predator types, as well as several cases in which nests were visited by multiple predators. Finally, 6 of 7 predators that were video-recorded depredating artificial nests were species also documented depredating natural nests. These observations verify the relevance of artificial-nest data for further study of these predators.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  5     Total Times Cited:  5     Cited Reference Count:  71 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.3398/064.072.0302     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),ARTIFICIAL BIRD NESTS;SITE SELECTION;REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS;DESTROYING BEHAVIOR;POPULATION-GROWTH;PASSERINE NESTS;RISK;CONSEQUENCES;FOREST;VIDEO;Prednisolone;ADP Ribose Transferases,,

In this paper, we take a mosquito-centric approach by studying mosquito states (i.e., energy, neurological health, and toxin information state) to demonstrate how key parameters of malaria, biting and movement rates and mosquito survival, are all emergent properties of those states when considered in the context of the background community interactions. We do so as follows: First, we develop a dynamic state variable model of mosquito biting and movement decisions that maximize mosquito expected reproductive success (fitness), and then we embed those optimal policies in a Monte Carlo simulation wherein mosquitoes attempt to feed on human hosts at domiciles where insecticide-treated bednets (ITNs) and insecticidal residual wall sprays (IRSs) are used. We find that biting rates, at the domicile level, are not impacted by mosquito state but that emigration rates from domiciles are determined by an interaction between mosquito energy state, information state, and risk of predation. This means that malaria incidence, at the village level at least, may be best understood as a response of mosquitoes to their ecological community that includes nectar-bearing plants, predators, the spatial arrangement of homes, and the protection of humans in those homes.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  12     Total Times Cited:  13     Cited Reference Count:  40 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1560/IJEE.56.3-4.297     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Mosquito;malaria;Anopheles;bednet;dynamic state variable;biting rate;Monte Carlo;ANOPHELES-GAMBIAE;HABITAT SELECTION;AEDES-AEGYPTI;TRADE-OFFS;DIPTERA;CULICIDAE;BEHAVIOR;NETS;TRANSMISSION;PYRETHROIDS;Culicidae;Bites and Stings,,

In harsh environments, where abiotic factors determine a clustering of resources during short timespans, competition and predation between organisms is likely to be enhanced. This is the case in tropical dry forests, where amphibians have limited opportunities to feed, their activity being restricted to the short rainy season. One way to maximize resource exploitation while avoiding predation risk is by adopting different diel activity patterns. We tested this hypothesis by comparing activity patterns in adults and recently metamorphosed juveniles of Pacific horned frogs (Ceratophrys stolzmanni) during field surveys and in an experimental study. Field surveys showed that the adults are strictly nocturnal, whereas freshly metamorphosed juveniles can be found active above ground at all hours, with a peak activity during daytime. The average body condition index of juveniles found active during the night was higher than that of juveniles found active during the day, suggesting that the weaker individuals may be constrained to being active during the day. On the other hand, in a laboratory experiment, juveniles that were visually exposed to adults moved less than those in the absence of adults. Both field and experimental observations indicate a temporal niche divergence between life stages. The results of the experiment offer support to the hypothesis that the juveniles in this species display an inverse activity pattern compared to adults, which can reduce competitive interactions and predation pressure from the larger conspecifics.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  81 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1371/journal.pone.0238949     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),AMBUSH-SITE SELECTION;ONTOGENIC SHIFTS;BODY-SIZE;BEHAVIORAL THERMOREGULATION;ACTIVITY PATTERNS;FORAGING ACTIVITY;DIURNAL ACTIVITY;BUFO-AMERICANUS;WATER ECONOMY;PREDATION;Adult,,

Understanding the underlying mechanisms which produce inverted biomass pyramids provides new ecological insights. Some ecologists hypothesize that ""the high growth rate of prey and low death rate of predators"" causes IBPs. However, we show this is not always the case (see Sections 3.1 and 4). We devise predator-prey models to describe three mechanisms that can lead to IBPs: (1) well-mixed populations with large prey turn-over rate, (2) well-mixed populations with prey immigration, and (3) non-mixed populations where the prey can hide in refuges. The three models are motivated by the three ecosystems where IBPs have been observed. We also devise three refuge mediated models, with explicit refuge size, which incorporate different prey responses in the refuge, and we discuss how these lead to IBPs.

Newts remain in breeding wetlands for a long period and are strongly affected by fish introduction; however, mechanisms of the exclusion observed in the field are still not well known. In particular, whether newts skip breeding and leave water for land in response to fish introduction and how aquatic shelter may influence their choice remain open questions. To investigate these questions, we experimentally studied the use of aquatic and terrestrial habitats during the breeding season of palmate newts, Lissotriton helveticus, in the presence and absence of goldfish, Carassius auratus. We determined the consequences of habitat choice on newt fitness by assessing sexual activity and number of eggs. There was a strong, significant avoidance of the aquatic environment in the presence of fish, particularly when no aquatic shelter was available. This escape from the water had an impact on reproduction: newts decreased their sexual activity and laid fewer eggs. The availability of shelters favoured coexistence but did not prevent a large proportion of the newts from leaving water and skipping reproduction. This study shows how the presence of fish and the absence of aquatic shelters can lead to newts forgoing aquatic life, thus improving our understanding of the mechanisms behind the coexistence and exclusion patterns found in the wild. More broadly, these data contribute to explaining aquatic versus terrestrial life in favourable and unfavourable environments. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Large predators and their prey are at particular risk in Asia, where they are threatened by poaching and habitat loss. To facilitate the best use of limited conservation resources, we created an objective, ecology-based method for identifying priority areas for conservation that incorporates both habitat representation and landscape-level features. Using tigers as an example, our method captures the range of ecological habitats where they occur, accounting for ecological, demographic, genetic, and behavioral differences. Our analysis is hierarchical. We divided the tiger range into distinct bioregions and identified tiger habitat types within each. We then delineated tiger conservation units throughout the bioregions and ranked the units based on habitat integrity, poaching pressure, and tiger population trends. To maintain representation of tiger populations and their ecology in the different tiger habitats, we made comparisons only among tiger conservation units from the same tiger habitat types nested within the same bioregion. We identified 159 tiger conservation units in three bioregions-the Indian subcontinent, Indochina, and Southeast Asia. We ranked the units in three categories that reflect the probability of long-term persistence of tiger populations (highest in level I units). Twenty-five tiger conservation units were classified as level I, 21 as level II, and 97 as level III. An additional 16 tiger conservation units for which little information is available were identified for immediate surveys. Levels I, II, and those identified for immediate surveys are the priority areas for immediate funding and for a regional tiger conservation strategy. One feature emerging from the study showed that protected areas cover only small areas of tiger conservation units. If the long-term prospects for tiger conservation are to improve, poaching must be stopped and protected areas increased in number, linked, and buffered by natural habitats. To enhance landscape integrity, the priority tiger conservation units that straddle international borders should be managed as transboundary reserves, giving tiger conservation a stronger regional structure. Like tigers, populations of other wide-ranging mammalian carnivores and large herbivores also are declining due to poaching and loss of habitat. The method we present for tigers can be adapted readily to improve conservation strategies for these species as well.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  117     Total Times Cited:  128     Cited Reference Count:  49 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1046/j.1523-1739.1998.96428.x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),POPULATION,,

Recreation use was highest from March to April and during weekends throughout the year. Daily use of recreation trails was highest during midday. By comparing habitat use (slope, ruggedness, distance to water, and distance to recreation trails) of female bighorn sheep on weekdays versus weekends, we were able to detect short-term shifts in behavior in response to recreation. In a logistic regression of bighorn sheep locations versus random locations for March and April, female locations at midday (1200 hours) were significantly more distant from recreation trails on weekends compared with weekdays. Our results indicate that within this region of JOTR, moderate to high levels of human recreation activity may temporarily exclude bighorn females from their preferred habitat. However, the relative proximity of females to recreation trails during the weekdays before and after such habitat shifts indicates that these anthropogenic impacts were short-lived.

We reviewed the peer-reviewed scientific literature for information on the known and potential effects of utility-scale wind energy development and operation (USWEDO) on terrestrial and marine non-volant wildlife and found that very little has been published on the topic. Following a similar review for solar energy we identified known and potential effects due to construction and eventual decommissioning of wind energy facilities. Many of the effects are similar and include direct mortality, environmental impacts of destruction and modification of habitat including impacts of roads, and offsite impacts related to construction material acquisition, processing and transportation. Known and potential effects due to operation and maintenance of facilities include habitat fragmentation and barriers to gene flow, as well as effects due to noise, vibration and shadow flicker, electromagnetic field generation, macro- and micro-climate change, predator attraction, and increased fire risk. The scarcity of before-after-control-impact studies hinders the ability to rigorously quantify the effects of USWEDO on non-volant wildlife. We conclude that more empirical data are currently needed to fully assess the impact of USWEDO on non-volant wildlife.

Small predatory sea stars (Leptasterias spp.) caused herbivorous snails (Tegula funebralis) added to rocky intertidal tidepools to quickly flee into refuge microhabitats outside tidepools within days, and this was associated with a 58% increase in microalgal growth after 2weeks. Similarly, removing sea stars caused snails to increase use of tidepools for 1-10months. After adding sea stars to tidepools, snails quickly fled and then consistently increased use of refuges outside tidepools for 10months. This was associated with average increases of 59% for microalgal growth over 1month and 254% for macroalgal growth over 8months inside tidepools. In 63 unmanipulated tidepools, densities of sea stars and snails were negatively correlated. High densities of snails were associated with unpalatable algal species and bare rock, while high densities of sea stars were associated with palatable algal species, suggesting that this apparent TMII may have community-level impacts. Though multiple lines of evidence suggest TMIIs were likely operating in this system, it was not possible to experimentally partition the relative contributions of TMIIs and density-mediated indirect interactions (DMIIs), so further caging experiments are necessary to distinguish their relative strengths. Overall, we suggest that predators can benefit primary producers by changing prey behavior even when predators and prey are unrestrained by cages or mesocosms, embedded in complex communities, and observed over multiple time scales.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  9     Total Times Cited:  9     Cited Reference Count:  53 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s00227-019-3469-5     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),TROPHIC CASCADES;COMMUNITY STRUCTURE;PREDATION RISK;RELATIVE IMPORTANCE;PREY;DENSITY;DIFFERENTIATION;CONSEQUENCES;AVOIDANCE;BEHAVIOR,,

Here we quantified physiological and behavioral traits, including body temperature and food consumption, of two mammals with differing thermoregulatory strategies in response to changes in climate and habitat. We show that both species responded to challenging climatic conditions by increasing torpor use to save energy, yet their responses were impacted by varying vegetation levels. Sugar gliders decreased torpor use in a dense habitat likely due to a signal of greater food production and protection from predators. Conversely, eastern pygmy possums employed more torpor perhaps to build up fat reserves in anticipation of leaner times. Indeed, in dense habitat eastern pygmy possums did not alter food intake yet showed an increase in body mass, whereas sugar gliders consumed less food and lost body mass, revealing the large energetic savings provided by torpor.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  54 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.isci.2021.103453     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),EASTERN PYGMY-POSSUMS;PREDATION RISK;BODY-TEMPERATURE;FORAGING BEHAVIOR;CERCARTETUS-NANUS;EXTINCTION RISK;TORPOR;FRAGMENTATION;HIBERNATION;SELECTION,,

We compared foraging in adult female elk presented with feeding trays of alfalfa pellets mixed with segments of plastic tube. As the ratio of alfalfa pellets to plastic tubes decreases, there is a point called the giving-up density (GUD), measured as the weight of remaining food, at which a foraging elk stops searching for pellets. We compared individual scanning rates, or vigilance, as well as GUDs, over trials in repeated measures that included single elk and elk in groups of two, three, four, five, seven, 10, 13 and 17. We also compared a group of four and a group of seven elk with and without their calves, and groups with and without a dominant individual, defined as a female that moved to a feeding tray and resulted in its being abandoned by another female. We found an exponential decline in GUD5 with increasing group size (F-1,F-117 = 5.14, P = 0.02) regardless of presence of calves and consistent with the 'group size effect,' which predicts lower individual vigilance with a greater number in a group, a welfare benefit of social foraging. Among 10 adults tracked as focal animals through at least three trials, all but one elk expressed lower GUDs in larger groups, leading to 14% less scanning with each additional elk individual in a group (F-1,F-117 = 8.42, R-2 = (118 repeated measures) = 0.60, P < 0.01). With the exponential decline in both GUD5 and scanning rate, we conclude that captive elk experience greater security as group size increases. Contrary to predictions from free-ranging elk, GUDs were significantly lower with calves present for the two group sizes compared (group of four, F-1,F-32 = 17.1, P < 0.01; seven, F-1,F-29 = 111.2, P < 0.01). With or without calves, neither scanning rate (F-1,F-59 = 2.34, P = 0.13) nor the relationship of scanning rate with group size (F-2,F-59 = 1.34, P = 0.25) changed. Separating dominant elk did not produce any significant effects. Pasture configuration to foster closer groups of elk could promote a healthier herd and more effective use of foraging areas. Farmers should manage elk groups to include calves with their dams whenever possible.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  56 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.applanim.2019.01.010     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Domesticated elk;Foraging;Giving-up density;On-farm welfare assessment;Pasture management;Social foraging;YELLOWSTONE-NATIONAL-PARK;GROUP-SIZE;PREDATION RISK;FORAGING BEHAVIOR;GRAZING LAWNS;VIGILANCE;AVOIDANCE;FORAGERS;CHEETAHS;MODELS,,

It often implies alterations of many abiotic and biotic factors and contributes to create new environmental conditions, including temperature, food resources, competition and predation. Despite increasing empirical evidence of intra-specific divergence in phenotypic traits (e.g., physiological, behavioural or morphological) between urban and rural individuals, such patterns have often remained disconnected from the underlying mechanisms involved. In the current study, we tested for divergence in functional morphological traits that are related to feeding ecology (i.e., bill morphology, body mass and condition) and/or to the locomotory performance in escaping from predators (i.e., wing, tarsus and tail morphology, body mass and condition) along a chronological gradient of urbanisation (old urban, recent urban and rural areas), using the New Zealand fantail, an endemic insectivorous passerine species. We found divergences in phenotypic traits related to bill morphology along the urban-rural gradient: birds inhabiting the old urban area had stubbier bills (i.e., shorter, deeper and wider bills) than those inhabiting the recent urban and rural areas. We did not detect any difference in locomotion-related morphological traits. Our results suggest the urbanisation-induced alteration in food resources may drive morphological divergence in bird populations. We emphasized the need for mechanistic and experimental studies, with a particular focus on resource-based mechanisms, to identify more precisely the morphological responses of urban populations to changes in food composition, and the resulting implications for communities in urban ecosystems.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  95 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s11252-021-01156-w     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Bill morphology;Insectivorous bird;Locomotion-related traits;New Zealand fantail;Resource-related traits;Urbanisation gradient;SPARROW PASSER-DOMESTICUS;DEPENDENT PREDATION RISK;BODY CONDITION;RAPID EVOLUTION;ESCAPE FLIGHTS;URBAN;PERFORMANCE;POPULATION;BILL;MASS;New Zealand,,

Allee effects have important implications for many aspects of basic and applied ecology. The benefits of aggregation of conspecific individuals are central to Allee effects, which have led to the widely held assumption that social species are more prone to Allee effects. Robust evidence for this assumption, however, remains rare. Furthermore, previous research on Allee effects has failed to adequately address the consequences of the different levels of organisation within social species' populations.        2. Here, we review available evidence of Allee effects and model the role of demographic and behavioural factors that may combine to dampen or strengthen Allee effects in social species. We use examples across various species with contrasting social structure, including carnivores, bats, primates and eusocial insects. Building on this, we provide a conceptual framework that allows for the integration of different Allee effects in social species.        3. Social species are characterised by nested levels of organisation. The benefits of cooperation, measured by mean individual fitness, can be observed at both the population and group levels, giving rise to population level and group level Allee effects respectively. We also speculate on the possibility of a third level, reporting per capita benefits for different individuals within a group (e.g. castes in social insects).        4. We show that group size heterogeneity and intergroup interactions affect the strength of population-level demographic Allee effects. Populations with higher group size heterogeneity and in which individual social groups cooperate demonstrate the weakest Allee effects and may thus provide an explanation for why extinctions due to Allee effects are rare in social species.        5. More adequately accounting for Allee effects in social species will improve our understanding of the ecological and evolutionary implications of cooperation in social species.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  37     Total Times Cited:  37     Cited Reference Count:  84 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/1365-2656.12759     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),demography;metapopulation;population dynamics;social group;task specialisation;AFRICAN WILD DOGS;GROUP-SIZE;DENSITY-DEPENDENCE;PREDATION RISK;ARGENTINE ANTS;LYCAON-PICTUS;HARVESTER ANT;COLONY SIZE;POPULATION;DYNAMICS,,

These tools can improve understanding of the spatial ecology of introduced predators in ecologically sensitive areas, such as where cats pose a threat to native species and where improvement of predator control methods is required. We studied fine-scale resource selection by feral cats in the ecologically important New Zealand braided-river ecosystem, where they pose a risk to endangered native ground-nesting birds. We collected 34 location datasets from 21 cats fitted with lightweight global positioning system-collars, and extracted landscape variables from a resource map created using very high spatial resolution satellite imagery (Quickbird) and object-base imagery analysis for image classification. We modelled second-order seasonal and annual resource selection functions and characterized landscape composition of highly-used areas using compositional analysis. At a population level, cats generally selected fine-scale landscapes that are important for their primary prey rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), and for refugia. An external validation of the annual model using data from cats tracked in an independent study showed a positive correlation with model predictions. Individual cats also visited habitats used by native ground-nesting birds, and thus pose a threat to them through secondary predation or individual specialization. Cat control operations should therefore focus around areas of concentrated ground-nesting bird activity and in areas identified as high-use by cats.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  14     Total Times Cited:  14     Cited Reference Count:  60 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s10530-013-0635-4     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Feral cats;Braided-river;Spatial ecology;GPS-telemetry;Remote sensing;New Zealand;EUROPEAN RABBIT ABUNDANCE;WAITAKI BASIN;NEW-ZEALAND;HABITAT USE;BEHAVIOR;MODELS;Decision Making;Cats,,

The difficulty of identifying ecological trade-offs may result from experimental comparisons that do not adequately mirror naturally occurring predator-prey relationships. To examine this, we captured 61 newly metamorphosed Acris blanchardi from ponds dominated either by fish or invertebrate predators. These predators are known to induce alternate phenotypic anti-predator responses at the larval stage. We used jumping performance as a measure of post-metamorphic fitness, and compared the morphological traits and jumping ability of frogs from ponds with and without fish. Frogs from fishless ponds can jump significantly farther than frogs from fish-dominated ponds. Morphological measurements indicated that overall frog size determined differences in jumping ability, with hind-leg length primarily explaining jumping performance. Differences in hind-leg length positively correlated with overall body size, which differed between the two types of ponds, and did not result from allometric growth between them. Differences in frog sizes presumably are related to differences in developmental anti-predator morphologies in larvae.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  2     Total Times Cited:  2     Cited Reference Count:  26 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",,metamorphosis;morphology;post-metamorphic costs;predators;PREDATION RISK;PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY;BEHAVIORAL PLASTICITY;ADAPTIVE PLASTICITY;LIFE-HISTORY;TADPOLES;COSTS;MORPHOLOGY;CONSEQUENCES;RESPONSES,,

Evolutionary ecologists increasingly study reaction norms that are expressed repeatedly within the same individual's lifetime. For example, foragers continuously alter anti-predator vigilance in response to moment-to-moment changes in predation risk. Variation in this form of plasticity occurs both among and within individuals. Among-individual variation in plasticity (individual by environment interaction or I x E) is commonly studied; by contrast, despite increasing interest in its evolution and ecology, within-individual variation in phenotypic plasticity is not.        2. We outline a study design based on repeated measures and a multilevel extension of random regression models that enables quantification of variation in reaction norms at different hierarchical levels (such as among and within individuals). The approach enables the calculation of repeatability of reaction norm intercepts (average phenotype) and slopes (level of phenotypic plasticity); these indices are not specific to measurement or scaling and are readily comparable across data sets.        3. The proposed study design also enables calculation of repeatability at different temporal scales (such as short-and long-term repeatability), thereby answering calls for the development of approaches enabling scale-dependent repeatability calculations.        4. We introduce a simulation package in the R statistical language to assess power, imprecision and bias for multilevel random regression that may be utilised for realistic data sets (unequal sample sizes across individuals, missing data, etc). 5. We apply the idea to a worked example to illustrate its utility. We conclude that consideration of multilevel variation in reaction norms deepens our understanding of the hierarchical structuring of labile characters and helps reveal the biology in heterogeneous patterns of within-individual variance that would otherwise remain 'unexplained' residual variance.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  81     Total Times Cited:  81     Cited Reference Count:  40 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/2041-210X.12430     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),heterogeneous residual variance;mixed-effect modelling;multidimensional reaction norms;multilevel random regression;phenotypic plasticity;repeatability;QUANTIFYING INDIVIDUAL VARIATION;PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY;CLUTCH SIZE;POPULATIONS;PERSONALITY;EVOLUTION;FLEXIBILITY;INCREASES;VARIABLES;MODELS,,

Yet, how species-specific life history traits interact with different components of the landscape to shape differences in individual home ranges at within-population level has received much less attention. Here, we review the empirical literature on ungulates to map our knowledge of the relative effects of the key environmental drivers (resource availability, landscape heterogeneity, lethal and non-lethal risks) on the sizes of individual home ranges within a population and assess whether species' characteristics (body mass, diet, and social structure), account for observed variation in the responses of the sizes of individual home ranges to local environmental drivers. Estimating the sizes of home ranges and measuring environmental variables raise a number of methodological issues, which complicate the comparison of empirical studies. Still, from an ecological point of view, we showed that (1) a majority of papers (75%) supported the habitat productivity hypothesis, (2) the support for the influence of landscape heterogeneity was less pervasive across studies, (3) the response of cattle-type to variation in food availability was stronger than the response of moose-type, and (4) species-specific body mass or sociality level had no detectable effect on the level of support to the biological hypotheses. To our surprise, our systematic review revealed a dearth of studies focusing on the ecological drivers of the variation in the sizes of individual home ranges (only about 1% of articles that dealt with home ranges), especially in the later decade where more focus has been devoted to movement. We encourage researchers to continue providing such results with sufficient sample sizes and robust methodologies, as we still need to fully understand the link between environmental drivers and individual space use while accounting for life-history constraints.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  2     Total Times Cited:  2     Cited Reference Count:  129 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.3389/fevo.2020.555429     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),ungulate;diet;complementary resource;landscape structure;life history trait;landscape heterogeneity;habitat;body mass;DEER CAPREOLUS-CAPREOLUS;ELK CERVUS-ELAPHUS;HABITAT SELECTION;PREDATION RISK;LANDSCAPE HETEROGENEITY;ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES;SEXUAL SEGREGATION;NATIONAL-PARK;BEHAVIOR;SPACE;Telemetry,,

Nonbreeders can buffer breeding population sizes and help their kin raise new generations of offspring, but in high numbers can compete and have negative effects. Long-term studies are useful for elucidating relationships among nonbreeder population parameters, such as density, survival, and transitions to breeding status. Florida scrub-jays are cooperative breeders where young delay breeding often for many years and are at risk of extinction across most of their range. Our objectives were to estimate how population covariates (pair density and mean family size) influenced Florida scrub-jay adult nonbreeder survival and breeding transitions using long-term data of uniquely marked birds and multistate capture-recapture models. The evolution and maintenance of Florida scrub-jay delayed breeding has been attributed to living in crowded and sharply delineated habitat at Archbold Biological Station, the site of longest long-term study. Contrastingly, most habitat we studied had a dynamic mixture of habitat quality with mean family sizes and pair densities much lower than the stable, optimal habitat at Archbold Biological Station. Despite having densities below carrying capacity, Florida scrub-jays still delayed breeding. We found that greater mean family size was associated with greater breeder survival, possibly because nonbreeders contributed to predator detection and territory defense. Nonbreeder-to-breeder transitions increased with increased annual breeder mortality rates but were influenced little by population densities. Most Florida scrub-jays became breeders by replacing dead breeders within occupied territories, and many male and female nonbreeders inherited their territories upon the death of their parents. Nonbreeders buffered changes in the breeding population supporting greater recognition of nonbreeder population roles within field and modeling studies.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  86 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1002/ecs2.3991     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),buffering;delayed breeding;long-term studies;nonbreeders;population density;TERRITORY QUALITY;FOOD SUPPLEMENTATION;LANDSCAPE CHANGE;POPULATION-SIZE;FIRE SPREAD;HABITAT;DISPERSAL;DEMOGRAPHY;BEHAVIOR;DENSITY;Breeding;Florida,,

Empirical evidence suggests that grazing by reef-associated herbivores along the coral reef-seagrass interface can be intense (e.g. conspicuous presence of bare-sand 'halos' surrounding coral reefs). This evidence must be interpreted with caution, however, as most of it comes from areas that have experienced sustained, intense overfishing. To quantify the impacts of piscivore removal on cross-habitat energy exchange at the coral reef-seagrass interface, we compared grazing intensity along fished and no-take reefs in the upper and lower Florida Keys. Using visual census techniques and direct measures of seagrass grazing, we documented the impacts of piscivore density on herbivory along the seagrass-coral reef interface. Grazing rates were greater than observed seagrass (Thalassia testudinum) production near reefs in the upper Keys, but less than 48% of production in the lower Keys. Analyses showed that these large differences were not related to regional differences in either herbivore density or species composition. Seagrass biomass was also lower near reefs in the upper Keys, where estimates of grazing were highest. Piscivores were dominated by transient predators (jacks and barracudas) whose densities varied with region and distance from reef, but not with protection from fishing. A nonsignificant negative correlation between great barracuda density and leaf losses from tethered shoots, coupled with the greater abundances of larger grazers near reefs, suggests that predation risk, rather than direct reductions in density, may limit grazers to intense feeding on seagrasses adjacent to reefs in the upper Keys. The large-scale variation in grazing intensity illustrates the need for more detailed quantifications of energy exchanges along the seagrass-coral reef boundary.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  41     Total Times Cited:  41     Cited Reference Count:  56 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.3354/meps333037     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),edge effects;herbivory;overfishing;parrotfish;spatial subsidies;trophic transfer;MARINE RESERVES;FISH ASSEMBLAGES;BARRIER-REEF;FLORIDA;TRAJECTORIES;TERRESTRIAL;CONSUMPTION;RECOVERY;BEHAVIOR;GROUPER;Food;Food Chain,,

However, the ecological patterns that reflect population oscillation trends are often not clearly visible without analytical instruments such as ecological models. Thus, ecological modeling plays a fundamental role in describing demographic processes that are important for population dynamics. Ecological models, besides making possible the visualization of ecological patterns, may also reveal patterns of population persistence in many trophic systems, including prey-predator or host-parasitoid relationships, interactions that are commonly present in integrated pest management programs. In this forum, we present the main ecological aspects important for model building and implementation of integrated pest management programs for insects. Particularly, in this study, we analyze the combination between host-parasitoid models and the concept of economic threshold level on a spatio-temporal scale. As a conclusion about the model combination, spatial structure is essential for models of this nature, since its introduction into the system significantly alters the economic threshold-level values.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  14     Total Times Cited:  15     Cited Reference Count:  63 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1590/S1519-566X2009000600001     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Theoretical ecology;integrated pest management;mathematical model;HOST-PARASITOID INTERACTIONS;POTENTIAL RISK-ASSESSMENT;NORTH CENTRAL TEXAS;BIOLOGICAL-CONTROL;DENGUE OUTBREAK;CLIMATE-CHANGE;INSECT;DYNAMICS;PERSISTENCE;EXTINCTION,,

In this paper, we revisit the role of inter-individual variability in population persistence and stability under predation pressure. As a case study, we consider interactions between a structured population of zooplankton grazers and their predators. Unlike previous structured population models, which only consider variability of individuals according to the age or body size, we focus on physiological and behavioural structuring. We first experimentally demonstrate a high degree of variation of individual consumption rates in three dominant species of herbivorous copepods (Calanus finmarchicus, Calanus glacialis, Calanus euxinus) and show that this disparity implies a pronounced variation in the consumption capacities of individuals. Then we construct a parsimonious predator-prey model which takes into account the intra-population variability of prey individuals according to behavioural traits: effectively, each organism has a 'personality' of its own. Our modelling results show that structuring of prey according to their growth rate and vulnerability to predation can dampen predator-prey cycles and enhance persistence of a species, even if the resource stock for prey is unlimited. The main mechanism of efficient top-down regulation is shown to work by letting the prey population become dominated by less vulnerable individuals when predator densities are high, while the trait distribution recovers when the predator densities are low.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  83     Total Times Cited:  90     Cited Reference Count:  49 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1371/journal.pone.0070576     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),DIEL VERTICAL MIGRATION;VISUAL PREDATION RISK;FUNCTIONAL-RESPONSE;ZOOPLANKTON;BEHAVIOR;PREY;PERSONALITIES;SELECTION;PARADOX;GROWTH,,

Model estimates of NCC ranged from 205 to 4,592 moose, demonstrating the critical influences of model structure and assumptions when applying NCC. Furthermore, population estimates during recent severe winters suggest that past models underestimated NCC on the Copper River Delta. We conducted a sensitivity analysis of a preferred model and determined that model components with the highest and lowest sensitivity were snow depth and lignin-and tannin-caused reductions in forage nutritional quality, respectively. Our low sensitivity values for lignin and tannin influences on NCC contrast with results in other NCC estimates. Overall, our results reinforce the need for, and will hopefully assist, adaptive management in response to landscape, population, behavioral, and climatic changes on the Copper River Delta, and demonstrate the importance of understanding model assumptions and structure in application of NCC estimates in the management of large herbivores in variable ecosystems.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  79 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.3996/122017-JFWM-104     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Alaska;model structure;moose;nutritional carrying capacity;open-diet selection;winter scenario;COPPER RIVER DELTA;HABITAT SELECTION;PLANT-COMMUNITIES;PREDATION RISK;ALCES-ALCES;ENERGY;BROWSE;HERBIVORE;PROTEIN;DEER,,

Data from 22 studies were analyzed using a random-effects model: Hedges's g effect sizes measured the mean difference in outcomes of individuals with/without a history of preinjury abuse, and Bayes factors assessed the probability that the outcomes differed. Patients with a history of alcohol and/or substance abuse had poorer neuroradiological outcomes, including reduced hippocampal (g=-0.82) and gray matter volumes (g=-0.46 to -0.82), and enlarged cerebral ventricles (g=-0.73 to -0.80).

The degree of boldness that is selectively favored depends on the magnitude of costs and benefits that may vary across time and space. We examined within- and between-individual variation in the boldness of courting male sand fiddler crabs, Uca pugilator, across an entire breeding season at a South Carolina (USA) salt marsh where courtship is restricted to supratidal embankments. Boldness was assessed by the time to re-emergence and the number of re-emergences of males who were purposely startled into their breeding burrows once every 3 min for a total of five times. The two measures of boldness were significantly positively correlated. Courting males are on average bolder when their density is high and when tidal conditions correspond to peaks in the number of females moving over the embankment surface. Time to re-emergence increases with successive startles although some males consistently re-emerge faster than others. Large males are not bolder than small males. When male density is high, nearest neighbors frequently re-emerge at the same time, suggesting that males cue on the responses of other nearby males, perhaps by assessing substrate vibration. This may reduce the chance of losing a potential mate to a local competitor.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  16     Total Times Cited:  17     Cited Reference Count:  51 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/j.1439-0310.2004.01047.x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),PREDATION RISK;ADAPTIVE SIGNIFICANCE;MATING-BEHAVIOR;CONSPECIFICS;STICKLEBACK;AGGRESSION;COURTSHIP;DECISION;CHOICE;GAME,,

Here, we include a second state variable-the contents of the bird's gut to investigate how a bird should optimise its gut size to minimise its long-term mortality, depending on the availability of food, the size of meal and the bird's digestive constraints. Our results show that (1) the current level of fat is never less important than gut contents in determining the bird's survival; (2) there exists a unique optimal gut size, which is determined by a trade-off between the energetic gains and costs of maintaining a large digestive system; (3) the optimal gut size increases as the bird's digestive cycle becomes slower, allowing the bird to store undigested food; (4) the critical environmental factor for determining the optimal gut size is the mass of food found in a successful foraging effort (""meal size""). We find that when the environment is harsh, it is optimal for the bird to maintain a gut that is larger than the size of a meal. However, the optimal size of the gut in rich environments exactly matches the meal size (i.e. the mass of food that the optimal gut can carry is exactly the mass of food that can be obtained in a successful foraging attempt).

Those environmental differences should select for heterogeneity in forager flower fidelity among honey bee subspecies, particularly when reward frequency differences are associated with competing flower types. We tested that evolutionary model by examining the foraging behaviour of Africanized honey bees (AHB), and by comparing our observations with those recorded for Italian (A. m. ligustica) and Caucasian honey bees (A. m. caucasica). The response of AHB (A. m. scutellata hybrid/introgressant) to reward frequency differences among flower colours was examined using artificial flower patches. Each patch contained blue, white, and yellow flowers. When rewards offered by ail three flower-morphs were identical, some foragers restricted visitation to blue and white flowers, while others showed fidelity to yellow flowers. Bees visiting blue and white flowers did not show a preference for either the blue or white colour morph under those conditions. However, forager behaviour changed when they were presented with different reward frequencies associated with the alternative flower colours. Bees frequenting blue and white flowers favoured blue when it offered a reward more frequently than white, and favoured white when the reverse was true. That behaviour occurred not only when the more frequently rewarding flower colour offered a higher harvest rate, but also when harvest rates obtained from all flower colours were equal. A change in flower colour fidelity involving yellow vs. blue and white flowers was observed only when reward frequency difference was linked to maximizing harvest rate. Those results contrast sharply to reported A. m. ligustica and A. m. caucasica honey bee behaviour: neither Italian nor Caucasian bees respond to reward frequency differences among flower colours, even between blue and white flowers.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  8     Total Times Cited:  8     Cited Reference Count:  83 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1080/00218839.1999.11101003     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Apis mellifera scutellata;Africanized honey bees;Apis mellifera ligustica;Apis mellifera caucasica;foraging;reward frequency;foraging constancy;flower colour;PREDATION RISK;APIS-MELLIFERA;BUMBLE BEES;BEHAVIORAL DECISIONS;INDIVIDUAL CONSTANCY;MINIMAL UNCERTAINTY;EUROPEAN HONEYBEES;FORAGING ECOLOGY;COMMON CURRENCY;PREY SELECTION;Reward,,

However, the role of parasites on diet specialization of their hosts has rarely been studied. Eye flukes can impair vision ability of their hosts and have been associated with alterations of fish feeding behavior. Here it was assessed whether European perch (Perca fluviatilis) alter their diet composition as a consequence of infection with eye flukes. Young-of-the-year (YOY) perch from temperate Lake Muggelsee (Berlin, Germany) were sampled in two years, eye flukes counted and fish diet was evaluated using both stomach content and stable isotope analyses. Perch diet was dominated by zooplankton and benthic macroinvertebrates. Both methods indicated that with increasing eye fluke infection intensity fish had a more selective diet, feeding mainly on the benthic macroinvertebrate Dikerogammarus villosus, while less intensively infected fish appeared to be generalist feeders showing no preference for any particular prey type. Our results show that infection with eye flukes can indirectly affect interaction of the host with lower trophic levels by altering the diet composition and highlight the underestimated role of parasites in food web studies.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  118 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1038/s41598-021-81568-y     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),ROACH RUTILUS-RUTILUS;STABLE-ISOTOPES;INTRASPECIFIC COMPETITION;3-SPINED STICKLEBACKS;MORPHOLOGICAL VARIATION;DIPLOSTOMUM-SPATHACEUM;FORAGING EFFICIENCY;SHOALING BEHAVIOR;TROPHIC POSITION;PREDATION RISK,,

This variability may arise through differences in physical habitats or biological interactions between parasites and their hosts, and may occur on very fine spatial scales. Using a pseudophyllidean cestode (Schistocephalus solidus) and the threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) as a model parasite-host complex, we investigated the association of infection with host diet composition and stomach fullness in different habitats of two large lakes in southwest Alaska. To become infected, the fish must consume pelagic copepods infected with the parasite's procercoid stage, so we predicted higher infection rates of fish in offshore habitats (where zooplankton are the primary prey) compared to fish from the littoral zone. Sticklebacks collected from the littoral and limnetic zones were assayed for parasites and their stomach contents were classified, counted, and weighed. Contrary to our prediction, permutational multivariate analysis of variance and principal components analysis revealed that threespine sticklebacks in the littoral zone, which consumed a generalist diet (pelagic zooplankton and benthic invertebrates), had higher parasite prevalence and biomass intensity than conspecifics in the limnetic zone, which consumed zooplankton. These results, consistent in two different lakes, suggest that differences in parasite prevalence between habitats may have been determined by a shift in host habitat due to infection, differential host mortality across habitats, differential procercoid prevalence in copepods across habitats, or a combination of the three factors. This paradoxical result highlights the potential for fine spatial variability in parasite abundance in natural systems.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  2     Total Times Cited:  2     Cited Reference Count:  80 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s10641-018-0719-1     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Gasterosteus aculeatus;Threespine stickleback;Schistocephalus solidus;Heterogeneity;Parasite;Foraging;Host manipulation;GASTEROSTEUS-ACULEATUS L;1ST INTERMEDIATE HOST;3-SPINED STICKLEBACK;EXPERIMENTAL-INFECTION;SHOALING BEHAVIOR;FOOD-INTAKE;PREDATION;GROWTH;SYSTEM;RISK;Prevalence,,

This distribution problem is hard to understand due to the many costs and benefits of each strategy in different settings. Ant colonies are faced by this problem and demonstrate two solutions: 1) centralizing resources in a single nest (monodomy) and 2) decentralizing by spreading resources across many nests (polydomy). Despite the possibilities for using this system to study the centralization/decentralization problem, the trade-offs associated with using either polydomy or monodomy are poorly understood due to a lack of empirical data and cohesive theory. Here, we present a dynamic network model of a population of ant nests which is based on observations of a facultatively polydomous ant species (Formica lugubris). We use the model to test several key hypotheses for costs and benefits of polydomy and monodomy and show that decentralization is advantageous when resource acquisition costs are high, nest size is limited, resources are clustered, and there is a risk of nest destruction, but centralization prevails when resource availability fluctuates and nest size is limited. Our model explains the phylogenetic and ecological diversity of polydomous ants, demonstrates several trade-offs of decentralization and centralization, and provides testable predictions for empirical work on ants and in other systems.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  5     Total Times Cited:  5     Cited Reference Count:  32 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1093/beheco/arz138     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),collective decision-making;decentralization;dynamic networks;polydomy;social insects;social networks;POLYDOMOUS ANT;MODEL;ORGANIZATION;STRATEGIES;PREDATION;EVOLUTION;NETWORKS;Cost-Benefit Analysis,,

Here, we address the hypothesis that observed phenotypic correlations among component behaviors of the bold-shy continuum are a result of underlying genetic correlations (quantitative genetic architecture). We used a replicated three-generation pedigree of zebrafish (Danio rerio) to study three putative components of the bold-shy continuum: horizontal position, swim level, and feeding latency. We detected significant narrow-sense heritabilities as well as significant genetic and phenotypic correlations among all three behaviors, such that fish selected for swimming at the front of the tank swam closer to the observer, swam higher in the water column, and fed more quickly than fish selected for swimming at the back of the tank. Further, the lines varied in their initial open field behavior (swim level and activity level).

For example, embryonic vocalizations facilitate synchronous hatching in some birds and crocodilians. Synchronous hatching in nonvocalizing turtles suggests a different mechanism of embryonic communication: vibration-induced hatching. We addressed the idea that embryos can communicate with one another via vibrations that expedite hatching in the pig-nosed turtle, Carettochelys insculpta, a species that has evolved rapid hatching in response to hypoxia during nest flooding. Laboratory experiments tested the hypotheses that groups of (sibling) embryos can hatch and emerge more rapidly than solitary embryos, and that a vibration cue can expedite hatching relative to a hypoxic cue alone. We first demonstrated a vibration cue for hatching: vibration-induced hatching latency (ca. 8 min) was shorter than the hypoxia-induced hatching latency (ca. 16 min). Second, latency to both hatching and emergence from experimental nests was significantly shorter in groups of eggs than solitary eggs, when subjected to hypoxic conditions (perfusion in gaseous nitrogen or immersion in water, respectively). Although we did not directly link vibrations and the sibling effect, leaving open the possibility of embryo vocalizations, our experiments, along with a simple mathematical model, suggest that pig-nosed turtle embryos can detect and respond to sibling vibrations, and that these embryonic signals may increase the survival of siblings by reducing the latency to hatch and emerge under flood conditions. Our results are also novel in revealing multiple hatching cues in a single species within a single environmental context. 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

We used an experimental manipulation to determine the extent to which a California population of the wood duck (Aix sponsa) used social information gleaned from visual cues inside nest boxes that might indicate the quality or occupancy of that site. Over two nesting seasons, we manipulated the contents of newly installed boxes to simulate one of three states: (1) presence of wood duck eggs, indicating current use of a nest site; (2) presence of down and shell membranes, indicating a previously successful nest; and (3) control nests with fresh shavings indicating an unused box. In addition, we measured habitat characteristics of the area surrounding each box to assess the use of external, non-social information about each nest site. We found no evidence that females laid eggs preferentially, or that conspecific brood parasitism was more likely to occur, in any of the treatments. In contrast, nest site use and reproductive traits of wood ducks did vary with vegetation cover, and orientation and distance of the box from water. Our results suggest that personal information, not social information, influences initial nest site selection decisions when females are unfamiliar with a site. Social cues likely become increasingly important once nest sites develop their own history, and a population becomes well established. Significance statement In selecting a nest site, birds may use many types of information, including habitat characteristics, their own previous breeding experience, or social cues inadvertently provided by other individuals of the same or different species. We examined information use in a Californian population of wood ducks by experimentally manipulating the visual cues within nest boxes and found that females did not use internal box cues to direct their nesting behaviors, appearing to rely on key habitat characteristics instead. These results contrast with previous studies of this system, suggesting that females may change the cues they use depending on their prior experience with a particular area. In the nest site selection literature, there appears to be a divergence between research on passerines versus waterfowl, and we advocate unifying these perspectives.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  112 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s00265-020-02904-2     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Personal and social information use;Waterfowl;Aix sponsa;Nest site selection;Conspecific brood parasitism;CONSPECIFIC BROOD PARASITISM;PUBLIC INFORMATION;PREDATION RISK;NATURAL CAVITIES;ATTRACTION;GOLDENEYES;BIRDS;EGGS;NEIGHBORS;REJECTION;Cues,,

In systems in which both parents provide parental care, each of the parents benefits from exhibiting (or having their partner exhibit) these behaviors. However, in many cases, costs and benefits differ between parents due to factors such as size or sex. Different intruder types may also impose different costs on parents. Predatory intruders might consume offspring, whereas conspecifics might threaten the social status of a parent, or provide benefits as a potential group joiner or mate. Responses to these intrusions may also be associated with variation in individual stress responses. We investigated associations among male and female sizes, and the interaction between these, with defense against conspecific and heterospecific territorial intruders by members of successfully breeding pairs in the cichlid fish Neolamprologus pulcher. We also investigated whether cortisol levels were associated with size or participation in territory defense because each may be a cause or consequence of individual variation in the stress response. We found that females paired with large males performed fewer defensive behaviors than females paired with smaller males. Males paired with relatively large females had higher baseline cortisol levels than those paired with smaller females. Collectively, individual characteristics such as size have consequences for each individual's behavior, and also influence the behavior, and endocrine state of social partners.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  1     Total Times Cited:  1     Cited Reference Count:  82 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1002/jez.2255     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),cooperative breeding;cortisol;Neolamprologus pulcher;size;territory defense;CICHLID FISH;PARENTAL INVESTMENT;NEOLAMPROLOGUS-PULCHER;TASK SPECIALIZATION;BEHAVIORAL DYNAMICS;BROODCARE HELPERS;SEXUAL CONFLICT;RISK-TAKING;CARE;SELECTION;Hydrocortisone,,

Cannibalism rarely occurred with alternative prey present, but was common without alternative prey. Without alternative prey, females cannibalized much more than males, but contrary to predictions, male presence did not reduce cannibalism rates. Male presence decreased female water use; however, this was counteracted by the fact that the lack of alternative prey increased female water use and activity while on the water. Furthermore, in groups of 4 males with 4 females, lack of alternative prey reduced male activity while on the water. Thus the predicted negative effect of sexual conflict on cannibalism was reduced by female and male responses to low food availability. Juveniles increased time off the water when more females or males were more on the water and active. Overall, cannibalism rates depended on alternative prey, male-female social dynamics, female foraging and juvenile refuge use.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  52 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.beproc.2018.07.003     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Antipredator behavior;Aquarius remiges;Cannibalism;Male harassment;Sexual conflict;Water strider;HYPERAGGRESSIVE MALES;FORAGING BEHAVIOR;MATING DYNAMICS;PREDATION RISK;WATER STRIDER;MATE CHOICE;HABITAT USE;COMPETITION;HARASSMENT;EVOLUTION,,

We observed a population of Spizella pusilla (Field Sparrow) with individuals of known age and identity over multiple years to examine how age of parents affected feeding rates and overall nesting success. Parents fed larger and older broods at higher rates. Feeding rates of paired individuals were also correlated with one another. However, males provisioned offspring at a consistently faster rate than females. Ordinal date and year were the only factors that influenced nest success, with nests failing more frequently early in the summer. These findings may indicate that environmental factors-and less so intrinsic factors-may dictate overall nest success. Although we were unable to detect an effect of parent age on feeding rates, our ability to detect such trends is likely limited by considerable behavioral variation in the population and relatively few birds that were monitored across consecutive years.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  1     Total Times Cited:  1     Cited Reference Count:  69 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1656/045.026.0303     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS;PARENTAL CARE;NEST PREDATION;BROOD SIZE;EXTRAPAIR PATERNITY;BIRDS;BEHAVIOR;GRASSLAND;RISK;EXPERIENCE,,

After temperament was assessed, horses were subjected to a stressor before or after the acquisition session of an instrumental task. Eight days later, horses were subjected to a reacquisition session without any stressor. Stress before acquisition tended to enhance the number of successes at the beginning of the acquisition session. Eight days later, during the reacquisition session, contrary to non-stressed animals, horses stressed after acquisition, and, to a lesser extent, horses stressed before acquisition, did not improve their performance between acquisition and reacquisition sessions. Temperament influenced learning performances in stressed horses only. Particularly, locomotor activity improved performances whereas fearfulness impaired them under stressful conditions. Results suggest that direct exposure to a stressor tended to increase acquisition performances, whereas a state of stress induced by the memory of a stressor, because it has been previously associated with the learning context, impaired reacquisition performances. The negative effect of a state of stress on reacquisition performances appeared to be stronger when exposure to the stressor occurred after rather than before the acquisition session. Temperament had an impact on both acquisition and reacquisition processes, but under stressful conditions only.

Choosing a large group may maximize safety, but choosing to join a small group can minimize the delay until a dominant reproductive position can be reached. We explored this trade-off between safety and rank using Neolamprologus pulcher, a cichlid fish in which individuals conform to a rigid within-group dominance hierarchy. In this species, females typically inherit dominant positions by ascending in rank, while males commonly take over a dominant breeding position by dispersing into a new group. Because females have fewer opportunities to switch groups, we predicted that females would place higher value on social rank within their group than would males. To test this, we examined male and female N. pulcher's preferences for joining large groups at a low rank versus joining small groups at a high rank. Males showed clear preferences for larger (presumably safer) groups, while females showed no such preferences. In a second experiment, we held joining rank constant, and found that both males and females showed a strong preference for large groups. Our results suggest that when joining a group, females consider both rank and safety whereas males are primarily concerned with safety.

However, previous investigations have largely focused on mammals and our understanding of the potential prosocial effects of glucocorticoids across vertebrates more broadly is still lacking. Here, we assessed whether experimentally elevated glucocorticoid levels (simulating endogenous cortisol responses mounted following disturbances) promote prosocial behaviours in wild groups of the cichlid fish, Neolamprologus pulcher. Using SCUBA in Lake Tanganyika, we observed how subordinate group members adjusted affiliation, helping, and submission (all forms of prosocial behaviour) following underwater injections of either cortisol or saline. Cortisol treatment reduced affiliative behaviours-but only in females-suggesting that glucocorticoids may reduce overall prosociality.

Despite the ecological relevance of multisensory perception in helping animals cope with uncertainty, empirical support from natural systems is rarely placed within an adaptive framework. The field of psychophysics provides a model for the study of cognitive processes by studying behavior. Using this as a foundation, we develop a framework that can be used to understand the evolutionary significance of multimodal perception. We develop predictions about the conditions under which multiple stimuli combine differently. A key outcome of our analysis is that the ecological context can influence the processes by which animals perceive multisensory stimuli. In addition to its theoretical importance, this framework predicts that anthropogenic activities can affect how animals perceive their environment, which may have profound ecological consequences.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  116     Total Times Cited:  116     Cited Reference Count:  57 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1093/beheco/arr220     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),CALIFORNIA GROUND-SQUIRRELS;PREDATION RISK;ANTIPREDATOR BEHAVIOR;MULTIPLE CUES;COMMUNICATION SIGNALS;ALARM BEHAVIOR;INFORMATION;ATTENTION;RESPONSES;RECOGNITION,,

The proposed model is a modification of the model presented by Upadhyay et al. (2008) [1]. Existence of the equilibria and their stability analysis (linear and nonlinear) has been studied. The dynamical transitions in the model have been studied by identifying the existence of backward Hopf-bifurcations and demonstrated the period-doubling route to chaos when the death rate of predator (mu(1)) and the growth rate of susceptible prey population (r) are treated as bifurcation parameters. Our studies show that the system exhibits deterministic chaos when some control parameters attain their critical values. Chaotic dynamics is depicted using the 2D parameter scans and bifurcation analysis. Possible implications of the results for disease eradication or its control are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

However, the assumptions and predictions of the theoretical models have rarely been tested experimentally in wild free-living vertebrates. Here, we look at resource contests in wild Neolamprologus pulcher, a cooperatively breeding cichlid fish that lives in permanent territories in Lake Tanganyika, Africa. To elicit a contest, we removed a dominant breeding male from his territory and held him for either a short (4.5 h) or a long (20 h) period. The original resident male was then returned to his territory, which typically resulted in an aggressive contest with a usurping male that had taken over in the original resident's absence. We found that contests were shorter than those previously observed in a laboratory setting, with more physically aggressive attacks. Contrary to our predictions, the relative size difference between the males had no effect on contest dynamics or outcome, probably because all of the males involved in these contests were similar in body size. Instead, motivational factors influenced contest dynamics. Longer original resident removal times increased usurper male aggression, as well as the duration and intensity of the contests. Original residents were more aggressive when contesting over their sole territory (socially monogamous) than when contesting over one of their multiple territories (socially polygynous). Usurpers won more contests overall, and more aggressive fish were more likely to win contests. To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine resource contests in wild free-swimming cichlids, and our results reveal that subjective resource value is a primary driver of the dynamics and outcome of territorial conflicts among dominant N. pulcher males. Our results further suggest that respect for ownership may reduce conflict in N. pulcher and be important in governing colony structure. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Animals that quickly learn important information, and learn at a young age, can gain a competitive advantage in exploiting resources. Moreover, animals that learn indirectly through social observations can avoid the fitness costs of directly learning about potential dangers. Here we tested such learning capabilities in ringed salamanders, Ambystoma annulatum, a species where adults are primarily solitary and do not provide parental care. Adults lay eggs in ponds where embryos have the opportunity to learn from chemical cues in their environment before hatching, whereupon the high density of larvae provides an opportunity to learn from social information. In this study, we found that these salamanders can learn an attraction to novel food stimuli as embryos and that naive observer larvae can learn from conspecifics that show attraction to stimuli. Embryonic exposure to a novel food stimulus (shrimp odour) caused attraction to that stimulus posthatching, and this response appeared to be generalized to another potential prey stimulus (mussel odour) but not to a novel plant stimulus. In a test of social learning, only observers that were paired with models corralled near a novel food stimulus were subsequently attracted to the stimulus. This study is the first to report embryonic learning of food or social learning by salamanders, providing more evidence for generalized learning by embryos and social learning by species lacking more complex social behaviours.

In vertebrates, prolactin and corticosterone are two important hormones that regulate parental investment because they stimulate parental care and mobilize energy, respectively. Further, concentrations of both hormones change in response to disturbances. One of the most important parental care behaviors in birds is incubation, since small changes in egg temperature have large effects on offspring. We investigated how prolactin and corticosterone may mediate parental incubation constancy (i.e., the daily amount of time spent incubating eggs) and regulation of egg temperature. We collected blood samples from female wood ducks (Aix sponsa) near the start and end of the incubation period to measure baseline and stress-induced (30 min after capture and restraint) hormone concentrations. We also quantified incubation constancy and egg temperature using artificial egg temperature loggers. As expected, prolactin decreased and corticosterone increased after 30 min of capture and restraint. Corticosterone concentrations (baseline and stress-induced) were negatively related to body mass, but were not related to incubation constancy. In contrast, prolactin concentrations (baseline and stress-induced) were higher at the end than the start of the incubation period, and stress-induced prolactin concentrations were positively related to incubation constancy following a nest disturbance (i.e., capture). Further, prolactin (baseline and stress-induced) concentrations were positively related to egg temperatures, but only after the disturbance. These results suggest that prolactin may be associated with the regulation of parental incubation constancy and resulting heat-transfer after a disturbance, which may ultimately affect offspring development.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  4     Total Times Cited:  4     Cited Reference Count:  74 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.ygcen.2020.113489     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Incubation;Parental care;Prolactin;Corticosterone;Wood duck;Stress-response;LONG-LIVED BIRD;INTRASPECIFIC NEST PARASITISM;REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS;STRESS RESPONSES;PARENTAL CARE;WOOD DUCKS;ADRENOCORTICAL RESPONSES;SEASONAL-CHANGES;PREDATION RISK;KING PENGUINS;Ovum,,

Thus, it is necessary for wildlife agencies to understand basic ecological processes of a given species at multiple scales to aid decision making at commensurately varied spatial and behavioral scales. Mountain lions (Puma concolor) occur throughout California, USA, and are at the center of a variety of management and conservation issues. For example, they are genetically and demographically at risk in 1 region yet apparently stable and negatively affecting endangered species in another. Currently, no formal plan exists for mountain lions in California to deal with these diverse scenarios involving issues of local mountain lion population viability and problems related to predation of endangered species. To facilitate development of a state-wide management and conservation plan, we quantified habitat selection by mountain lions at 2 spatial scales across the range of environmental conditions in which the species is found in California. Our analyses used location data from individuals (n = 263) collared across the state from 2001-2019. At the home range scale, mountain lions selected habitat to prioritize meeting energetic demands. At the within home range scale, mountain lions avoided areas of human activity. Further, our analyses revealed 165,350-170,085 km(2), depending on season, of suitable mountain lion habitat in California. Fifty percent of the suitable habitat was on unprotected lands and thus vulnerable to development. These habitat selection models will help in the development of a state-wide conservation and management plan for mountain lions in California by guiding mountain lion population monitoring through time, prioritization of habitat to be conserved for maintaining demographic connectivity and gene flow, and efforts to mediate mountain lion-prey interactions. Our work and application area will help with wildlife policy and management decisions related to depredation problems at the local scale and issues of habitat connectivity at the statewide scale.

Children reacted the fastest to predators, followed by disease carriers and finally aposematically coloured animals. Furthermore, children manifested the highest accuracy when distinguishing predators from non-predators, followed by disease carriers and harmless animals, with the most errors occurring when identifying the aposematically coloured from non-aposematically coloured animals. Importantly, children more vulnerable to infectious diseases responded to disease carriers faster than healthier children.

In the two bifurcations, we can come to the conclusion that different Allee effect will have different bifurcation value and the increasing of the Allee effect will increase the value of bifurcation, respectively.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  3     Total Times Cited:  3     Cited Reference Count:  30 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Maybe""}",10.1155/2016/4275372     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),FUNCTIONAL-RESPONSES;BIFURCATION-ANALYSIS;MODEL;BEHAVIOR;Prednisolone,,

These groups turn together in unison and produce escape waves. However, it is not clear how escape waves are created from local interactions, nor is it understood how these patterns are shaped by natural selection. By startling schools of fish with a simulated attack in an experimental arena, we demonstrate that changes in the direction and speed by a small percentage of individuals that detect the danger initiate an escape wave. This escape wave consists of a densely packed band of individuals that causes other school members to change direction. In the majority of cases, this wave passes through the entire group. We use a simulation model to demonstrate that this mechanism can, through local interactions alone, produce arbitrarily large escape waves. In the model, when we set the group density to that seen in real fish schools, we find that the risk to the members at the edge of the group is roughly equal to the risk of those within the group. Our experiments and modelling results provide a plausible explanation for how escape waves propagate in nature without centralized control.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  64     Total Times Cited:  64     Cited Reference Count:  52 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1098/rsos.140355     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),escape waves;collective animal behaviour;fish schools;self-organization;INFORMATION-TRANSFER;SELFISH HERD;CLUPEA-HARENGUS;FISH;BEHAVIOR;FLOCKS;PREDATION;AGGREGATION;INDIVIDUALS;PERFORMANCE;Animal Shells;Animals,,

The first patch successfully measured giving-up densities (GUDs), confirmed by octopus prey presence and higher foraging at sites with historically greater octopus presence. However, nontarget foragers also foraged on these experimental food patches. Our second floating patch design successfully excluded nontarget species from subtidal patches, and from intertidal patches at high tide, but allowed for foraging by E. dofleini. The second design successfully measured GUDs and suggested that octopus preferred foraging in a subtidal habitat compared to an intertidal habitat. We ascribe the higher GUD in the intertidal habitat to its higher predation risk relative to the subtidal habitat. The second patch design seems well suited for E. dofleini and, in conjunction with a camera system, could be used to provide behavioural indicators of the octopus's abundance, perceptions of habitat quality and predation risk.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  56 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1093/mollus/eyaa039     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Research Design,,

Our purpose was to determine the effects of large males (>= 5 yr old) on mating and associated activities. Groups with large males were larger than those containing smaller males. Most groups of bison were mixed-sex (90%), but large males occurred in only one-half of all groups. Moreover, females in groups with large males were more likely to copulate than those in groups with smaller males, indicating a female preference for large males. Nevertheless, our results are consistent with large males seeking out adult females for mating rather than vice versa. Mating peaked in mid-August during both the study years and was highly synchronous. Scent marking was coincident with mating, an outcome consistent with a hypothesis of such behavior triggering ovulation. Scent marking by large male bison occurred in both male-male and male-female contexts, but was associated most often with sexual activities. No differences in group size occurred with changes in weather or among vegetation types occupied by bison. Group size of bison, however, was larger with increasing distance from the forest edge, which likely was a response to predation risk in this predator-rich environment.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  32     Total Times Cited:  32     Cited Reference Count:  99 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/j.1439-0310.2007.01411.x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),WHITE-TAILED DEER;MOOSE ALCES-ALCES;SEXUAL SEGREGATION;REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS;SCENT-MARKING;SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION;HABITAT SELECTION;ALASKAN MOOSE;FALLOW DEER;BIRTH-DATE,,

Compared with the predator-prey model without the Allee effect, it is found that the Allee effect of the prey species increases the extinction risk of both the prey and predator. If the Allee effect of the prey species is strong and the mortality of the predator species is relatively low, then the prey and predator cannot coexist after the predator invasion. Moreover, it is shown that the model with Allee effect undergoes the heteroclinic loop bifurcation and subcritical and supercritical Hopf bifurcations. With the brokenness of the heteroclinic loop, a stable or unstable limit cycle will appear. The Allee effect of the prey species can lead to unstable or stable periodic fluctuations. It is also found that the positive equilibrium of the model could change from stable to unstable, and then disappear when the strength of Allee effect increases continuously from zero.

We evaluated variation in incubation off-bout duration and frequency among Greater Prairie-Chickens (Tympanuchus cupido pinnatus (Brewster, 1885)) in the Nebraska Sandhills, USA. Greater Prairie-Chicken life history favors incubation behaviors that prioritize success of the current breeding attempt over adult survival. Previous observations suggest incubating females make these behavioral decisions based on ambient temperature conditions, their own body condition, and predation risk. We monitored nest attendance by females at 30 Greater Prairie-Chicken nests to identify proximate cues used to make behavioral decisions regarding incubation. We recorded 930 incubation off-bouts. Females took 1.9 +/- 0.7 off-bouts/day (mean +/- SD), each with a mean (+/- SD) duration of 43.3 +/- 24.1 min. Off-bouts were shorter in duration at higher wind speeds, at lower ambient temperatures, at nests with less cover, and at nests closer to roads. Females were most likely to leave the nest during mid-morning and evening, as are most gallinaceous birds, and incubation off-bouts became less frequent later in the season.

Trout have caused widespread reductions in the distribution and abundance of native galaxiid fishes, a family dominated by threatened species. The effects have been most severe on non-diadromous species (those lacking a marine migratory stage), which are commonly eliminated from streams by trout. Galaxiid populations in lakes, and those with migratory 'whitebait' stages, have also been affected, but the extent of the impacts are less understood. The mechanisms controlling negative interactions between trout and native fish, and how the environment modifies those interactions, will be important for future management. Experiments and field comparisons indicate size-specific predation by trout is the main driver of negative interactions. Large trout (> 150 mm long) do the greatest damage and small galaxiids (those with adult sizes < 150 mm long) are the most at risk. The fry stage of non-diadromous galaxiids is particularly vulnerable. Despite galaxiid fry production in some trout-invaded reaches, often no fry survive making them population 'sinks' that must be sustained by adult dispersal. Trout are also associated with changes in galaxiid behaviour and alterations to stream benthic communities. However, effects on galaxiid growth and fecundity have been little studied. Recent work also indicates that habitat conditions, especially floods, low flows and natural acidity, can mediate trout-galaxiid interactions. We argue that managers should be more proactive in their response to the plight of galaxiids, and we identify avenues of research that will benefit native fish conservation activities in the future.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  61     Total Times Cited:  63     Cited Reference Count:  100 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",,exotic species management;disturbance;invasion;predation;Salmonid;INTRODUCED BROWN TROUT;FRESH-WATER FISH;SALMO-TRUTTA L;NATIVE FISH;POPULATION-STRUCTURE;VULGARIS-STOKELL;RAINBOW-TROUT;NORTH-ISLAND;TOP-DOWN;LAND-USE;New Zealand,,

We expected that attachment of collars would increase rates of grooming behaviors and alter patterns of space use. Frequency of grooming was >3 times higher following attachment of radiocollars on captive rabbits; however, the grooming rate declined rapidly and returned to within 5% of pre-collaring levels after 7 days. Free-ranging rabbits exhibited relatively longer distance movements immediately following and during the 2 weeks after capture and attachment of radiocollars, but those movements decreased during weeks 3-4 post-collaring. Rabbits also shifted use areas away from capture locations. Our results suggest that: 1) rabbits became habituated to the presence of collars with respect to grooming; and 2) although, magnitude of movements following capture and collaring in the field attenuated with time, some animals continued to avoid capture areas up to 4 weeks after collaring.

Twenty-nine published and four unpublished studies of leopard diet that had relative prey abundance estimates associated with them were analysed from 13 countries in 41 different spatial locations or temporal periods throughout the distribution of the leopard. A Jacobs' index value was calculated for each prey species in each study and the mean of these was then tested against a mean of 0 using t or sign tests for preference or avoidance. Leopards preferentially prey upon species within a weight range of 10-40 kg. Regression plots suggest that the most preferred mass of leopard prey is 25 kg, whereas the mean body mass of significantly preferred prey is 23 kg. Leopards prefer prey within this body mass range, which occur in small herds, in dense habitat and afford the hunter minimal risk of injury during capture. Consequently, impala, bushbuck and common duiker are significantly preferred, with chital likely to also be preferred with a larger sample size from Asian sites. Species outside the preferred weight range are generally avoided, as are species that are restricted to open vegetation or that have sufficient anti-predator strategies. The ratio of mean leopard body mass with that of their preferred prey is less than 1 and may be a reflection of their solitary hunting strategy. This model will allow us to predict the diet of leopards in areas where dietary information is lacking, also providing information to assist wildlife managers and conservation bodies on predator carrying capacity and predator-prey interactions.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  360     Total Times Cited:  375     Cited Reference Count:  123 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/j.1469-7998.2006.00139.x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),character displacement;Carnivora;diet;Jacobs' index;optimal foraging;predation preference;preferred prey weight range;prey susceptibility;MACAQUES MACACA-RADIATA;KRUGER-NATIONAL-PARK;FEEDING ECOLOGY;FOOD-HABITS;RAIN-FOREST;KALAHARI LEOPARDS;HUNTING BEHAVIOR;ELECTIVITY INDEX;AFRICAN SAVANNA;FORAGE RATIO,,

The aim of this study was to evaluate three different parameters of phytophagy of the mullein bug both in laboratory (phytophagous behavior) and field (fruit damage) tests: 1) apple cultivar, 2) fruit size, and 3) nymphal instar. In the laboratory, nymphs were observed individually for 15 min in Petri dishes containing agar gel and an apple fruitlet to evaluate feeding punctures of four apple cultivars, four fruit sizes, and five nymphal instars. In the orchard, nymphs were caged at bloom in sleeve cages to evaluate damage on the developing fruit of seven apple cultivars and three nymphal instars on 'Red Delicious'. The feeding punctures in the laboratory were higher on 'Red Delicious' than on 'Honeycrisp'; fruit damage in the orchard did not differ among cultivars at mid-season, but was higher on 'Red Delicious' than on 'Lobo' and 'Marshall McIntosh' at harvest. The number of feeding punctures in the laboratory was higher on 7-9 mm than on 18-20 mm size fruit for 'Red Delicious', but not for 'Honeycrisp'. The number of feeding punctures in the laboratory made by the fifth nymphal instar was higher than those made by younger nymphs, but fruit damage in the orchard did not differ among nymphal instars. Our results will help to elaborate a management chart for this insect by minimizing risks and promoting its use for biocontrol.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  5     Total Times Cited:  5     Cited Reference Count:  27 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1093/jee/tow209     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Heteroptera;Campylomma verbasci;plant bug;omnivory;apple;CAMPYLOMMA-VERBASCI HEMIPTERA;MEYER HETEROPTERA;PLANT;INJURY;Feeding Behavior;Fruit,,

The direction of the effect of density on dispersal should be affected by the relative costs and benefits of living in an area with high population density. Animals may benefit from high population density due to mate availability and predator risk dilution, but may also face increased competition in high density areas. These conflicting mechanisms should influence the pattern of change in population density between pre- and post-dispersal locations: do dispersing individuals choose to move to areas of higher or lower population density than that at their natal site? We examined the influence of density on dispersal in brush mice (Peromyscus boylii). We documented pre-and post-dispersal locations of individuals using both radio telemetry and live-trapping, and used a spatially explicit capture-recapture model to estimate density across the landscape. We also tested for a relationship between dispersal distance and local population density at the natal site. Animals tended to settle in areas with higher population densities than where they were born. This pattern held when landscape-level changes in population density were incorporated: the magnitude of change in local population density between the pre-and post-dispersal locations of a given individual tended to be greater than would be explained by increasing population density across the landscape alone. Further, dispersal distances were shorter when local natal population density was higher.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  6     Total Times Cited:  6     Cited Reference Count:  52 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1890/14-1661.1     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),density dependence;dispersal;Peromyscus boylii;population density;spatially explicit capture-recapture models;HABITAT SELECTION;SITE SELECTION;CONSPECIFIC ATTRACTION;DEPENDENT DISPERSAL;PEROMYSCUS-BOYLII;GROUP-SIZE;DECISIONS;DYNAMICS;COMPETITION;VIGILANCE;Mice;Population Density,,

Constraints imposed by natural enemies, such as predators or competitors, may push cooperator groups closer to this threshold, thus increasing the risk that stochastic fluctuations will drive them below it. This may indirectly drive these groups to extinction, thereby increasing the risk of population extinction. In this paper, we construct mathematical models of the dynamics of groups of cooperators and non-cooperators in the presence of two types of enemies: enemies whose dynamics do not depend on the dynamics of their victim (e.g., amensal competitor, generalist predator) and those whose dynamics do. In the latter case, we distinguish positive (e.g., specialist predator) and negative (e.g., bilateral competitor) reciprocal effects. These models correspond to the classical amensal, predation and competition models, in the presence of an Ailee effect. We then develop the models to study consequences at the population level. By comparing models with or without an Allee effect, we show that enemies decrease the group size of cooperators more than that of non-cooperators, and this increases their group extinction risk. We also demonstrate how an Allee effect at a lower dynamical level call have consequences at a higher level: inverse density dependence at the group level generated lower population sizes and higher risks of population extinction. Our results also suggest that demographic compensation can be achieved by cooperators through an increased intrinsic growth rate, or by decreasing the enemy constraint. Both of these types of compensation have been observed in empirical studies of cooperators.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  72     Total Times Cited:  74     Cited Reference Count:  84 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1034/j.1600-0706.2000.910212.x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),AFRICAN WILD DOGS;SURICATES SURICATA-SURICATTA;WREN MALURUS-SPLENDENS;REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS;GROUP-SIZE;SOCIAL-ORGANIZATION;LYCAON-PICTUS;POPULATION-DYNAMICS;SEYCHELLES WARBLER;BEHAVIOR,,

Box turtles in our study exhibited more escape behavior when exposed to urine from a predator (coyote, Canis latrans) than when exposed to urine from a nonpredator (white-tailed deer, Odocoileus virginianus) or a blank control. Escape behavior is consistent with an antipredator response. In addition, the turtles decreased their handling time for food when in the presence of urine from either species of mammal in comparison to the blank, indicating that chemical cues from mammals in general may result in increased vigilance by terrestrial turtles.

Feral cats Felis catus introduced onto oceanic islands pose a major ecological threat to endemic vertebrates, but their control is difficult. Immunocontraception has not been considered previously as a method for their control or eradication, and therefore we used a modelling approach to assess whether virus-vectored immunocontraception (VVIC) might be effective.        2. We compared the relative efficiency of cat control:eradication using immunocontraception and three different disseminating techniques, i.e. baits, genetically modified viral vectors, or both. We accounted for several forms of dynamic compensation likely to arise in a population with artificially reduced fertility.        3. We conclude that, under the assumptions of our model, immunocontraception can control or eradicate feral cats on oceanic islands. VVIC was found to be a more efficient dissemination technique than baits, but an integrated method involving viral-infected baits was the most likely to lead to eradication.        4.

Specialist parasites can modify predator behavior, yet rarely have cascading effects on multiple predator species and prey been evaluated. We examined influences of specialist phorid parasites (Pseudacteon spp.) on three predatory ant species and herbivores in a coffee agroecosystem. Specifically, we examined whether changes in ant richness affected fruit damage by the coffee berry borer (Hypothenemus hampei) and whether phorids altered multi-predator effects. Each ant species reduced borer damage, and without phorids, increasing predator richness did not further decrease borer damage. However, with phorids, activity of one ant species was reduced, indicating that the presence of multiple ant species was necessary to limit borer damage. In addition, phorid presence revealed synergistic effects of multiple ant species, not observed without the presence of this parasite. Thus, a trait-mediated cascade resulting from a parasite-induced predator behavioral change revealed the importance of functional redundancy, predator diversity, and food web complexity for control of this important pest.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  30     Total Times Cited:  30     Cited Reference Count:  68 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1890/11-1431.1     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Azteca instabilis;biodiversity;biological control;coffee agroforest;ecosystem function;multi-predator effects;Procryptocerus hylaeus;Pseudacteon;Pseudomyrmex simplex;trait-mediated interaction;COFFEE BERRY BORER;BIOLOGICAL-CONTROL AGENTS;PARASITIC PHORID FLIES;INTRAGUILD PREDATION;ECOLOGICAL INTERACTIONS;HYPOTHENEMUS-HAMPEI;TROPHIC CASCADES;DIVERSITY DEPEND;ANT COMMUNITIES;PREY;Food Additives,,

Over the past decade, the coastal waters off Cape Cod, Massachusetts, have emerged as the only known aggregation site for the white shark (Carcharodon carcharias) in the western North Atlantic. During periods of seasonal residency, white sharks patrol the shoreline in search of pinniped prey, bringing them in close proximity to popular beaches where people recreate.        Aim. To examine whether white sharks off Cape Cod are more likely to occupy shallow depths (and consequently more likely to overlap with recreational water users) under certain conditions.        Methods. We deployed short-term, pop-up satellite archival transmitting (PSAT) tags and acoustic transmitters on 14 subadult and adult white sharks off the coast of Cape Cod during the summer and fall of 2017. PSAT tags provided fine-scale depth and temperature data, which were combined with high-resolution location data obtained from an acoustic telemetry array, to identify the depth and temperature preferences of white sharks when resident in the area.        Key results. Sharks spent the majority (95%) of tracked time at depths of 0-31 m and at temperatures from 8.9 degrees C to 20.7 degrees C. During resident periods along Cape Cod, individuals spent almost half (47%) of their time at depths of less than 4.5 m, but made frequent excursions to mid-shelf depths, alternating between the surf zone and deeper offshore waters. Sharks were slightly more likely to occupy shallow depths at night during the new moon. The relationship between shark depth and lunar phase varied over the course of the day, suggesting the mechanism underlying lunar effects differs among diel periods.        Conclusions. Although the overall risk posed to humans by white sharks is low, there is a high potential for overlap between white sharks and recreational water users off Cape Cod. The risk of interaction may be slightly higher during periods when local environmental conditions favour the species' predatory stealth by influencing prey behaviour or detectability.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  2     Total Times Cited:  2     Cited Reference Count:  104 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1071/WR20029     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),acoustic telemetry;Carcharodon carcharias;depth distribution;predator ecology;satellite tag;European Continental Ancestry Group,,

The complexities of its transmission and the sparse evidence on the effectiveness of control strategies in diverse settings provide significant challenges for the design of effective public health policy against this disease. Mathematical modelling is a useful tool for simulating control packages under locally specific transmission conditions to inform optimal timing and frequency of phased interventions for cost-effective control of echinococcosis. The aims of this review of 30 years of Echinococcus modelling were to discern the epidemiological mechanisms underpinning models of Echinococcus granulosus and E. multilocularis transmission and to establish the need to include a human transmission component in such models.        Methodology/Principal Findings: A search was conducted of all relevant articles published up until July 2012, identified from the PubMED, Web of Knowledge and Medline databases and review of bibliographies of selected papers. Papers eligible for inclusion were those describing the design of a new model, or modification of an existing mathematical model of E. granulosus or E. multilocularis transmission. A total of 13 eligible papers were identified, five of which described mathematical models of E. granulosus and eight that described E. multilocularis transmission. These models varied primarily on the basis of six key mechanisms that all have the capacity to modulate model dynamics, qualitatively affecting projections. These are: 1) the inclusion of a 'latent' class and/or time delay from host exposure to infectiousness; 2) an age structure for animal hosts; 3) the presence of density-dependent constraints; 4) accounting for seasonality; 5) stochastic parameters; and 6) inclusion of spatial and risk structures.        Conclusions/Significance: This review discusses the conditions under which these mechanisms may be important for inclusion in models of Echinococcus transmission and proposes recommendations for the design of dynamic human models of transmission. Accounting for the dynamic behaviour of the Echinococcus parasites in humans will be key to predicting changes in the disease burden over time and to simulate control strategies that optimise public health impact.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  19     Total Times Cited:  19     Cited Reference Count:  69 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1371/journal.pntd.0002386     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),HUMAN ALVEOLAR ECHINOCOCCOSIS;LIFE-CYCLE;POPULATION-DYNAMICS;CONTROL OPTIONS;HUMAN-BEHAVIOR;MULTILOCULARIS;GRANULOSUS;DOGS;PREDATION;FOXES;Mathematics,,

Larval Ae. triseriatus show significantly greater antipredatory responses when compared to larval Ae. albopictus in the presence of predation cues from C. appendiculata. The potential for evolution of antipredatory behavioral responses to C. appendiculata in Ae. albopictus is unknown. We used a controlled laboratory selection experiment to test whether Ae. albopictus could evolve antipredatory behavioral responses to C. appendiculata predation. We subjected replicate Ae. albopictus populations to four generations of predation by C. appendiculata or a predator-free control treatment and compared the behavior and life history of Ae. albopictus in the two treatments in each generation. There were no differences in Ae. albopictus behavioral responses between predation and control lines in any of the four generations. There was also no evidence of differences in life histories between predation and control lines. Ae. albopictus is superior as a competitor compared with Ae. triseriatus, which it has replaced in areas where C. appendiculata are rare. Our results suggest limited potential for Ae. albopictus to evolve stronger antipredatory behavioral responses to C. appendiculata predation and imply that C. appendiculata will continue to act as an impediment to invasion by Ae. albopictus and replacement of Ae. triseriatus and to promote coexistence of these competitors.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  9     Total Times Cited:  9     Cited Reference Count:  64 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1603/033.046.0407     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Aedes albopictus;Aedes triseriatus;Corethrella appendiculata;antipredatory behavior;controlled selection;CONTAINER-DWELLING MOSQUITOS;LARVAL ANURANS;COMPETITIVE INTERACTIONS;PREDATION RISK;NORTH-AMERICA;DIPTERA;POPULATIONS;PREY;CULICIDAE;SIZE;Aedes,,

When protective adult morphology is induced by developmental environmental conditions predictive of future predation risk, adult behavior should be adjusted accordingly to maximize predator avoidance. While behavior is typically strongly affected by the adult environment, developmental plasticity in adult behaviormediated by the same pre-adult environmental cues that affect morphologycould ensure an effective match between anti-predatory morphology and behavior. The coordination of environmentally induced responses may be especially important in populations exposed to predictable environmental fluctuations (e.g., seasonality). Here, we studied early and late life environmental effects on a suite of traits expected to work together for effective crypsis. We focused on wing color and background color preference in Bicyclus anynana, a model of developmental plasticity that relies on crypsis as a seasonal strategy for predator avoidance. Using a full-factorial design, we disentangled effects of developmental and adult ambient temperature on both appearance and behavior. We showed that developmental conditions affect both adult color and color preference, with temperatures that simulate natural dry season conditions leading to browner butterflies with a perching preference for brown backgrounds. This effect was stronger in females, especially when butterflies were tested at lower ambient temperatures. In contrast to the expectation that motionlessness enhances crypsis, we found no support for our hypothesis that the browner dry-season butterflies would be less active. We argue that the integration of developmental plasticity for morphological and behavioral traits might improve the effectiveness of seasonal anti-predatory strategies.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  17     Total Times Cited:  18     Cited Reference Count:  44 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1002/evl3.113     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Animal coloration;background matching;phenotypic plasticity;seasonal environments;PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY;PIGMENTATION;TEMPERATURE;MORPHOLOGY;INDUCTION;SELECTION;SUCCESS;PHASES;Seasons;Color,,

Prey should have longer flight initiation distance when their background, movement, or current posture reduces crypsis. Flight initiation distance of ectotherms may increase at lower body temperature to compensate for slower running speed. However, for cryptic prey, fleeing might increase the probability of being detected. The Round-tailed Horned Lizard (Phrynosoma modestum Girard, 1852) is eucryptic and resembles small stones. We predicted that flight initiation distance by P. modestum is shorter among stones than on uniform sand. Because movement and upright posture disrupt crypsis, we predicted that flight initiation distance is greater after movement and when standing than when still and lying on the ground. As predicted, flight initiation distances were shorter on a rocky than sandy area, when lying flat than standing, and while immobile than after moving. We measured running speed and flight initiation distance to determine relationships among body temperature, speed, and escape decisions. Running speed and flight initiation distance were reduced at lower body temperature, suggesting that crypsis reinforced by immobility is more advantageous than longer flight initiation distance for cool, slow lizards. The lizards adjusted escape decisions to current effectiveness of crypsis and escape ability.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  17     Total Times Cited:  18     Cited Reference Count:  42 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1139/Z10-068     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),GROUND SKINK;BEHAVIOR;FLIGHT;CAMOUFLAGE;PREDATION;SAURIA;COLOR;PREY;Lizards,,

Although ecosystem and management models typically assume that krill are passive drifters, their relatively large size and strong swimming ability suggest that the active movement of krill may play an important role in their spatial distribution. Thus, active swimming behavior by krill may influence spatial structure of food web interactions (e.g. feeding behavior of seabirds and marine mammals) and regional commercial fishery activity. The objective of this work was to model the potential for active movement to affect krill distribution, and consequently growth, reproductive success, and survival. We used state-dependent life history theory, implemented by stochastic dynamic programming, in combination with spatial information on food availability, current velocity, temperature, and predation risk, to predict krill swimming behavior near the northern Antarctic Peninsula. We found that including active krill behavior resulted in distribution patterns that are associated with increased survival, growth, and reproductive success compared to a model that treats krill as passive drifters. The expected reproductive success of actively behaving krill was about 70% greater than that of passively diffusing krill, suggesting that there are strong selective pressures for active behavior along oceanic drift trajectories. This modeling framework will benefit assessments of new catch limits as krill fishing grounds are partitioned into smaller spatial management units.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  11     Total Times Cited:  11     Cited Reference Count:  83 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.3354/meps11324     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Euphausia superba;Behavior;Stochastic dynamic programming;Management;Advection;Southern Ocean;SCALE MANAGEMENT UNITS;SOUTH SHETLAND ISLANDS;EUPHAUSIA-SUPERBA;SCOTIA SEA;VERTICAL MIGRATION;NORTHERN KRILL;VARIABILITY;PREDATORS;BEHAVIOR;GROWTH,,

The ""dilemma of the selfish herd"" is that movement rules that are easy for individuals to follow, fail to produce true aggregations, while rules that produce aggregations require individual behavior so complex that one may doubt most animals can follow them. If natural selection at the individual level is responsible for herding behavior, a solution to the dilemma must exist. Using computer simulations, we examined four different movement rules. Relative predation risk was different for all four movement rules (p < 0.05). We defined three criteria for measuring the quality of a movement rule. A good movement rule should (a) be statistically likely to benefit an individual that follows it, (b) be something we can imagine most animals are capable of following, and (c) result in a centrally compact flock. The local crowded horizon rule, which allowed individuals to take the positions of many flock-mates into account, but decreased the influence of flock-mates with distance, best satisfied these criteria. The local crowded horizon rule was very sensitive to the animal's perceptive ability. Therefore, the animal's ability to detect its neighbors is an important factor in the dynamics of group formation. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

However, few studies have investigated how spatiotemporal scales and movement/activity patterns shape responses to this food/cover trade-off while accounting for individual characteristics (e.g. sex) and for variation in predation risk (e.g. hunting) and in resource abundance/quality. We hence studied temporal changes in habitat selection of 30 GPS-collared females and 15 males of Mediterranean mouflon, Ovis gmelini musimon x Ovis sp., at two scales, i.e. 48 h home range selection within a subpopulation area (broad scale) and choice of movement steps (defined as the linear segment between two consecutive locations) according to activity state (fine scale), in southern France. During the hunting-free/food-abundant period, males selected at both scales the foraging habitats providing the best conditions for optimizing their future reproductive success and only selected areas perceived as safe during inactive steps. During the corresponding lambing period, and at both scales, females selected areas perceived as safe that should optimize lamb survival. They switched to the best foraging habitats only when lambs were weaned and only for active steps. By contrast, during hunting, when food was also scarce, both sexes selected home ranges with high proportions of the habitats perceived as safe, in which they performed all their activities. This result suggested that risk avoidance exceeded all the other individual and environmental factors in the hierarchy of the determinants of habitat selection during the hunting period. Coupling scale-specific habitat selection and activity patterns was hence decisive in disclosing how individuals fulfil their specific needs under seasonally changing levels of habitat attributes important for fitness.

We hypothesized that human activities and infrastructure cause a decrease in the individual performance of preys because of anthropogenically enhanced predation risk. We evaluated the impacts of commercial logging and road networks on the fitness of a large herbivore known to be sensitive to human disturbance: the forest-dwelling woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou). For 8 consecutive years (2004-2011) we monitored 59 individuals using GPS telemetry in the Charlevoix region of Quebec, Canada. We also used Very High Frequency telemetry locations collected on 28 individuals from 1999-2000. We related habitat selection of adult caribou at various spatio-temporal scales to their probability of dying from predation, and to indices of their reproductive success and energy expenditure. The probability that adult caribou died from predation increased with the proportion of recent disturbances (including cutblocks <= 5 years old) in their annual home range. The respective effects of increasing paved and forestry road densities depended upon the overall road density within the home range of caribou. At a finer scale of 10 to 15 days before their death, caribou that were killed by a predator selected for recent disturbances more than individuals that survived, and avoided old mature conifer stands. The home range area of caribou increased with road density. Finally, the composition of the home range of females had no effect on their reproductive success. We show that human activities and infrastructure may influence the individual performance of large prey species in highly managed regions. We outline the need to consider the full set of impacts that human development may have on threatened animal populations, with particular emphasis on predator-prey relationships and population dynamics.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  34     Total Times Cited:  35     Cited Reference Count:  57 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1371/journal.pone.0073695     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),CARIBOU RANGIFER-TARANDUS;FOREST-DWELLING CARIBOU;WOODLAND CARIBOU;HOME-RANGE;HABITAT SELECTION;ROE DEER;LARGE HERBIVORES;BOREAL FOREST;CALF SURVIVAL;ROADS;Humanities;Humanism;Humans,,

The Alpine newt courts during both day and night times and exhibits a complex suite of behaviours involving olfactory, visual and tactile cues. Displaying in both dark and light conditions may increase the number of mating opportunities and alleviate predation risk, but the frequency and efficacy of the various tactics deployed may vary across light conditions, leading males to vary their use of these tactics across different light regimes. To test this hypothesis, we video-recorded sexual encounters at two light intensities in a controlled experimental design. When courting in the dark, males used comparatively more olfactory rather than visual displays. They also relied more on positive feedback from the female before releasing a spermatophore for her to pick up. The particular mix of tactics used under each light condition is likely to be adaptive because in the dark (1) visual communication is hampered, making olfactory displays possibly more effective and (2) males depositing spermatophores are more likely to lose fertilizations to competitors. Mating in light and dark conditions has similar reproductive payoffs, which shows that displaying in the dark is not detrimental and may even be advantageous if predation risk is reduced at night.

We develop a vigilance model which allows birds to control the area the flock occupies as well as their vigilance rate. The optimal strategy is found for the birds under a variety of environmental conditions. In particular the effect of each environmental parameter on this optimum is considered in turn. How the model can be adapted for different bird species is also investigated.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  5     Total Times Cited:  5     Cited Reference Count:  22 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1093/imamci/17.1.75     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),foraging;predation;spatial model;strategy;vigilance;GROUP-SIZE;STURNUS-VULGARIS;HOUSE SPARROWS;FLOCKING;PREDATION;DISTANCE;BEHAVIOR;BIRDS;COVER,,

This tradeoff affects the population dynamics of the plant-herbivore-predator interaction. A new functional response is derived based on the Holling type 2 functional response and the assumption that the herbivore can forage at a rate that maximizes its fitness. The predation rate on the herbivore is assumed to be proportional to the product of the time that the herbivore spends foraging and a risk factor that reflects the habitat complexity; where greater complexity means greater interspersion of high food quality habitat and refuge habitat, which increases the amount of the edge zone between refuge and foraging areas, making foraging safer. The snowshoe hare is chosen as an example to demonstrate the resulting dynamics of an herbivore that has been intensely studied and that undergoes well-known cycling. Two models are studied in which the optimal foraging by hares is assumed, a vegetation-hare-generalist predator model and a vegetation-hare-specialist predator model. In both cases, the results suggest that the cycling of the snowshoe hare population will be greatly moderated by optimal foraging in a habitat consisting of interspersed high quality foraging habitat and refuge habitat. However, there are also large differences in the dynamics produced by the two models as a function of predation pressure.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  4     Total Times Cited:  4     Cited Reference Count:  73 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s12080-013-0210-8     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Herbivore-vegetation dynamics;Predation refuges;Optimal foraging;Snowshoe hare;Limit cycle oscillations;Landscape complexity;PREDATOR-PREY INTERACTIONS;SNOWSHOE HARES;POPULATION-DYNAMICS;HABITAT USE;BOREAL FOREST;FORAGING TIME;FIRE REGIME;RISK;FOOD;BEHAVIOR,,

While previous observational studies reported considerably high heritabilities of helping behaviour in cooperatively breeding vertebrates, experimental studies disentangling the relevant genetic and non-genetic components of cooperative behaviour are lacking. In a half-sibling breeding experiment, we investigated the repeatability and heritability of three major helping behaviours performed by subordinates of the cooperatively breeding fish Neolamprologus pulcher. To experimentally manipulate the amount of help needed in a territory, we raised the fish in two environments differing in egg predation risk. All three helping behaviours were significantly repeatable, but had very low heritabilities. The high within-individual consistencies were predominantly due to maternal and permanent environment effects. The perceived egg predation risk had no effect on helping, but social interactions significantly influenced helping propensities. Our results reveal that developmentally plastic adjustments of provided help to social context shape cooperative phenotypes, whereas heritable genetic variation plays a minor role.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  19     Total Times Cited:  19     Cited Reference Count:  69 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1098/rspb.2017.0369     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),cooperation;maternal effects;heritability;repeatability;cichlid;INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES;DELAYED DISPERSAL;SPECIALIZATION;EVOLUTION;SELECTION;BEHAVIOR;SIZE;CARE;CONSEQUENCES;PROLACTIN;Genetic Variation,,

Such behaviours are critical for the spotted lanternfly (SLF) (Lycorma delicatula), an invasive, destructive insect pest spreading rapidly in the USA. High-speed video of SLF nymphs released under different conditions showed that these insects self-right using both active midair righting motions previously reported for other insects and novel post-impact mechanisms that take advantage of their ability to experience near-total energy loss on impact. Unlike during terrestrial self-righting, in which an animal initially at rest on its back uses appendage motions to flip over, SLF nymphs impacted the surface at varying angles and then self-righted during the rebound using coordinated body rotations, foot-substrate adhesion and active leg motions. These previously unreported strategies were found to promote disproportionately upright, secure landings on both hard, flat surfaces and tilted, compliant host plant leaves. Our results highlight the importance of examining biomechanical phenomena in ecologically relevant contexts, and show that, for small animals, the post-impact bounce period can be critical for achieving an upright landing.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  41 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1098/rsif.2021.0367     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),invasive;anti-predator;dropping;body rotation;rebound;manoeuvrability;DIRECTED AERIAL DESCENT;HEMIPTERA FULGORIDAE;BEHAVIOR;ECOLOGY,,

Experimental studies have shown that the evolution of host defense mechanisms to a focal enemy is impacted by the surrounding enemy community. Theoretically, the evolution of host defenses against a single enemy population, typically parasites, has been widely studied, but only recently has the impact of community interactions on host-parasite evolution been looked at. In this article, we theoretically examine the evolutionary behavior of a host population that must allocate defenses between two enemy populations, parasites and predators, with defense against one enemy constraining defense against the other. We show that in simpler models the composition of the enemy community plays the key role in determining the defense strategy of the hosts, with the hosts building up defenses against the enemy population posing a larger threat. However, this simple driver is shown to break down when there is significant recovery and reproduction from infected hosts. Additionally, we find that most host diversity is likely to occur when there is a combined high risk of infection and predation, in common with experimental studies. Our results therefore provide vital insight into the ecological feedbacks that drive the evolution of host defense against multiple enemy populations.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  8     Total Times Cited:  8     Cited Reference Count:  42 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1086/684682     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),host-parasite;defense evolution;predator-prey;community complexity;adaptive dynamics;PREDATOR-PREY INTERACTIONS;RESISTANCE;COEVOLUTION;DYNAMICS;TOLERANCE;PATHOGENS;VIRULENCE;SELECTION;DIVERSIFICATION;AVOIDANCE,,

Theory can assume an individual decides whether and where to feed, at any point in the light cycle and under any new conditions, by predicting future conditions and maximizing an approximate measure of future fitness. We develop four such theories for stream trout and evaluate them by their ability to reproduce, in an individual-based model, seven patterns observed in real trout. The patterns concern how feeding in four circadian phases-dawn, day, dusk, and night-varies with predation risk, food availability, temperature, trout density, physical habitat, day length, and circadian cycles in food availability. We found that theory must consider the full circadian cycle: decisions at one phase must consider what happens in other phases. Three theories that do so could reproduce almost all the patterns, and their ability to let individuals adapt decisions over time produced higher average fitness than any fixed behavior cycle. Because individuals could adapt by selecting among habitat patches as well as activity, multiple behaviors produced similar fitness. Our most successful theories base selection of habitat and activity at each phase on memory of survival probabilities and growth rates experienced 1) in the three previous phases of the current day or 2) in each phase of several previous days.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  5     Total Times Cited:  5     Cited Reference Count:  44 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1093/beheco/araa070     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),activity selection;circadian rhythms;foraging;habitat selection;population models;theory;trade-off decisions;trout;JUVENILE ATLANTIC SALMON;BROWN TROUT;INDIVIDUAL VARIABILITY;VERTICAL MIGRATION;FORAGING BEHAVIOR;FOOD AVAILABILITY;ACTIVITY PATTERNS;RAINBOW-TROUT;STREAM;DRIFT;Feedback,,

Wasteful killing, the partial consumption and/or abandonment of prey, is a perplexing phenomenon because the costs of this behavior seem high (e.g. energetic loss, risk of injury). Wasteful killing may be the product of a context-specific, adaptive foraging strategy restricted spatially and/or temporally to conditions of prey abundance. Alternatively, wasteful killing may represent a context-general syndrome of high aggression that results in the capture of prey that are not consumed. We investigated the conditions in which a web-building spider the North American black widow (Latrodectus hesperus) participates in wasteful killing. We employed a powerful repeated-measures design that reduces error variance by controlling for individual differences. Across the adult life cycle of female spiders collected from urban habitats throughout Phoenix, AZ, we repeatedly measured each spider's foraging voracity and wastefulness after varied periods of food restriction (2, 7, and 14 d). While food restriction decreased body condition, condition alone was a poor predictor of voracity and wasteful killing. Our results indicate that previous food restriction i) shortens latency to attack, ii) heightens the number of prey killed per trial, and iii) reduces wastefulness. Latency to attack and wasteful killing were neither repeatable within individuals nor correlated with each other and therefore appear unlikely to be components of a behavioral syndrome. We discuss other possible benefits for wasteful killing in the contexts of predation risk and mate attraction.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  9     Total Times Cited:  9     Cited Reference Count:  41 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/j.1439-0310.2010.01870.x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),SPIDERS DOLOMEDES-TRITON;PARTIAL PREY CONSUMPTION;SEXUAL CANNIBALISM;FITNESS CONSEQUENCES;BEHAVIORAL SYNDROMES;FISHING SPIDER;ARANEAE;PREDATION;MODEL;African Continental Ancestry Group,,

Recent studies suggest that body armour might be influenced by additional factors besides predation, and/or even by sexual selection. We investigated variation in dermal armour in 13 populations of armadillo lizards Ouroborus cataphractus, spanning the entire distribution range of the species. We obtained thickness measurements of osteoderms - bony plates embedded in dermal layer of the skin - using micro- and nano-computed tomography. Using these data, we examined the effects of predation pressure/risk and climatic variables on dermal armour variation and addressed sexual and ontogenetic influence. Our results show that climate is the only factor affecting variation in dermal armour. Populations inhabiting more arid environments, characterized by low summer precipitation and mild winter temperatures, are relatively more armoured than those present in less arid environments. In contrast to our expectations, predation pressure or perceived predation risk was not associated with osteoderm thickness. The results of our study support the idea that the evolution of defensive traits might not be driven exclusively by predator-prey interactions, but could be moulded by environmental factors. In particular, we highlight the role of dermal armour as a potentially important mechanism to reduce evaporative water loss in arid environments.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  10     Total Times Cited:  10     Cited Reference Count:  50 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/oik.05401     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),antipredator defence;osteoderm;predation;sexual dimorphism;thermoregulation;trophic interactions;water loss;CORDYLUS-CATAPHRACTUS;SEXUAL-DIMORPHISM;ECOLOGICAL CAUSES;TRADE-OFF;EVOLUTION;BEHAVIOR;SKIN;OSTEODERMS;STRENGTH;MODE;Lizards,,

Substantial variations in sea-ice conditions were detected across seasons, years and sub-regions, revealing ice-ocean dynamics more complex than Arctic-wide trends suggest. This variation contrasted with a highly consistent pattern of migration and residency by several populations, indicating that belugas can accommodate widely varying sea-ice conditions to perpetuate philopatry to coastal migration destinations. However, a number of anomalous migration and residency events were detected and coincided with anomalous ice years, and in one case with an increase in killer whale (Orcinus orca) sightings and reported predation on beluga whales. The behavioural shifts were likely driven by changing sea-ice and associated changes in resource dispersion and predation risk.

However, much less is known about the effect of artificial light at night on their fitness. We tested the hypothesis that planktonic animals, such as Daphnia spp., are able to correctly assess light intensity- and spectrum-dependent-mortality risk due to predation by planktivorous fish and select depths offering the highest possible fitness gain in the vertical gradient of different artificial light sources (halogen, metal-halide, cool white LEDs, and high pressure sodium lamps) commonly used in street lighting. To test this hypothesis, we compared the virtual distributions of three clones of Daphnia longispina from simulations based on an experimentally parameterized, optimizing individual-based model with distributions observed in laboratory experiments performed with 5-d-old individuals in an experimental apparatus comprised of twin vertical columns. Our hypothesis was confirmed only partially, since the distributions obtained in the experiments overlapped the virtual distributions only in the gradient of LEDs and high pressure sodium light, which suggests that that the strength of the maladaptive response could depend on the type of artificial light (i.e., spectral composition) penetrating the water column. Moreover, the results revealed that the response to the presence of artificial light is clone-specific, which suggest that it could be a selective factor for microevolutionary changes.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  1     Total Times Cited:  1     Cited Reference Count:  53 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1002/lno.11691     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),DIEL VERTICAL MIGRATION;ULTRAVIOLET-RADIATION;PREDATION RISK;LIFE-HISTORY;ZOOPLANKTON;BEHAVIOR;NIGHT;PREY;UV;INSECTS;Daphnia,,

We explore how state (amount of hoarded food) affects willingness to take extra predation risk to obtain larger food rewards, particularly in animals that may overemphasize safety. Assuming a sigmoid fitness function, we explore how a supplement in state influences this willingness trade danger for food energy. Above a threshold, the model predicts the Supplement will weaken this willingness. Incremental increases in state in the deceleratory phase yield smaller fitness gains. so it pays to increase emphasis on safety after receiving a supplement. Below this threshold, the model makes the opposite prediction because incremental increases in state yield bigger fitness gains and so it pays to decrease emphasis on safety. We use the model to explain why hoarding gray jays (Perisoreus canadensis) were induced by an experimental subsidy to accept greater danger. This formerly puzzling finding makes sense if the jays' effective hoard was relatively small, due to theft and decomposition. We discuss adaptive state-dependent choice as a general explanation for apparently irrational behavior. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

During the evolution of ecosystems, manifold mechanisms have emerged to avoid predation. So called secondary defences, which are used after a predator has initiated prey-catching behaviour, commonly involve the expression of toxins or deterrent substances which are not observable by the predator. Hence, the possession of such secondary defence in many prey species comes with a specific signal of that defence (aposematism). This paper builds on the ideas of existing models of such signalling behaviour, using a model of co-evolution and generalisation of aversive information and introduces a new methodology of numerical analysis for finite populations. This new methodology significantly improves the accessibility of previous models.        In finite populations, investigating the co-evolution of defence and signalling requires an understanding of natural selection as well as all assessment of the effects of drift as an additional force acting on stability. The new methodology is able to reproduce the predicted solutions of preceding models and finds additional solutions involving negative correlation between signal strength and the extent of secondary defence. In addition, genetic drift extends the range of stable aposematic solutions through the introduction of a new pseudo-stability and gives new insights into the diversification of aposematic displays.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  1     Total Times Cited:  1     Cited Reference Count:  38 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1051/mmnp/20149310     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),predator-prey;co-evolution;drift;finite population;adaptive dynamics;WARNING SIGNAL;HONEST SIGNALS;COLORATION;TOXICITY;STABILITY;SELECTION;DEFENSE,,

In this work, the hypothesis that inducible defenses increase the stability of tritrophic chains is tested, through the numerical analysis of a continuous-time model that discriminate between defenses affecting attack rate of predators, and defenses affecting predator handling time. In addition, discrimination between feeding costs of defenses affecting attack rate, and metabolic costs affecting feeding requirement for zero growth are considered. System stability was examined by computing dominant Lyapunov exponents, and through continuation routines of bifurcation points. Background parameter values were taken from two published studies. Our results show that a tritrophic system will generally be stabilized by the incorporation of inducible defenses and by their associated costs, but a number of new outcomes were obtained. Different long-term behavior is predicted if either one or two prey populations exhibit defenses. In the latter case, the defense of the basal prey dominates the dynamics. Handling time based inducible defenses exert a stronger stabilizing effect than attack rate based ones, but also impose a higher extinction risk for top predators. Inducible defenses in particular and trait-mediated indirect effects in general can be important sources of stability in natural systems. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The existence of spatial refuges for IG prey has recently been noted for their importance in allowing coexistence. However, reduction in basal prey availability might lead IG prey to leave spatial refuges for greater access to prey, leading to increased IG predation and fewer opportunities for coexistence. We determined how the availability of prey affected space-use patterns of bobcats (Lynx rufus, IG prey) in relation to coyote space-use patterns (Canis latrans, IG predators). We located animals from fall 2007 to spring 2009 and estimated bobcat home ranges and core areas seasonally. For each bobcat relocation, we determined intensity of coyote use, distance to water, small mammal biomass, and mean small mammal biomass of the home range during the season the location was collected. We built generalized linear mixed models and used Akaike Information Criteria to determine which factors best predicted bobcat space use. Coyote intensity was a primary determinant of bobcat core area location. In bobcat home ranges with abundant prey, core areas occurred where coyote use was low, but shifted to areas intensively used by coyotes when prey declined. High spatial variability in basal prey abundance allowed some bobcats to avoid coyotes while at the same time others were forced into more risky areas. Our results suggest that multiple behavioral strategies associated with spatial variation in basal prey abundance likely allow IG prey and IG predators to coexist.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  21     Total Times Cited:  21     Cited Reference Count:  59 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s00442-010-1797-8     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Bobcat;Coexistence;Coyote;Intraguild predation;Spatial refuge;HOME-RANGE;INTERFERENCE COMPETITION;MICROHABITAT-SELECTION;MESOPREDATOR RELEASE;RISK;COYOTES;OWL;COEXISTENCE;FOOD;COMMUNITIES;Prednisolone,,

Dynamic shifts in parental care behaviors, such as between nest defense and direct provisioning of the offspring, are required in response to environmental variation. However, the neural mechanisms which mediate such behavioral shifts remain a mystery. The anemonefish, Amphiprion ocellaris, represents an experimentally valuable model in social neuroscience which is conducive to manipulating the environment while simultaneously measuring parental care. The goal of this study was to determine the extent to which arginine vasotocin (AVT) and isotocin (IT) signaling are necessary for males to shift between direct egg care and aggressive nest defense in the presence of intruders, Domino damselfish (Dascyllus trimaculatus). The IT receptor antagonist desGly-NH2-d(CH2)(5) [D-Tyr(2),Thr(4)]OVT, significantly reduced direct egg care, while at the same time increased levels of aggressive nest defense relative to vehicle. Conversely, blockade of AVT using the antagonist d(CH2)(5) [Tyr(Me)(2)]AVP, reduced aggression and tended to increase egg care. Results demonstrate that male anemonefish alter their parental strategy in response to allospecific intruders, and that IT and AVT signaling oppositely regulate parental care displays of aggression versus egg care.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  2     Total Times Cited:  2     Cited Reference Count:  81 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.yhbeh.2020.104717     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Parental care;Aggression;Parental strategies;Nonapeptides;Anemonefish;BRAIN ARGININE VASOTOCIN;SOCIAL-BEHAVIOR NETWORK;PATERNAL BEHAVIOR;CICHLID FISH;VASOPRESSIN INNERVATION;AGGRESSIVE-BEHAVIOR;STEROID-HORMONES;SEX-DIFFERENCES;PREDATION RISK;MATERNAL-CARE,,

Both tactics yield equal rewards on average, but the rewards generated by producer are more variable. A dynamic variance-sensitive foraging model predicts that social foragers should increase their use of scrounger with increasing energy requirements and/or decreased food availability early in the foraging period. We tested whether natural variation in minimum energy requirements (basal metabolic rate or BMR) is associated with differences in the use of producer-scrounger foraging tactics in female zebra finches Taeniopygia guttata. As predicted by the dynamic variance-sensitive model, high BMR individuals had significantly greater use of the scrounger tactic compared with low BMR individuals. However, we observed no effect of food availability on tactic use, indicating that female zebra finches were not variance-sensitive foragers under our experimental conditions. This study is the first to report that variation in BMR within a species is associated with differences in foraging behaviour. BMR-related differences in scrounger tactic use are consistent with phenotype-dependent tactic use decisions. We suggest that BMR is correlated with another phenotypic trait which itself influences tactic use decisions.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  38     Total Times Cited:  38     Cited Reference Count:  47 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/j.1600-0706.2009.17357.x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),ENERGY RESERVES;REPEATABILITY;DOMINANCE;BEHAVIOR;PREDATION;PRODUCER;RISK;STRATEGIES;SCROUNGERS;ENERGETICS;Basal Metabolism,,

Expansion of urban areas typically leads to species loss but may also induce more subtle changes in species dynamics through selection or plasticity. Using a dual correlative (field) and experimental (aviary) approach, we here show that free-ranging urban house sparrows in southern France were smaller and lighter than their rural counterparts after allometric scaling, whereas 2 independent indices of nutritional (feather growth rates) and developmental (feather asymmetry) stress did not vary with urbanization. When subjecting these individuals to urban or rural diets in a highly predictable, controlled setting, rural but not urban sparrows decreased their body mass, independent of diet type, to the extent that initial scaled mass differences between urban and rural birds disappeared by the end of the captive period. By integrating field-and aviary measurements of body size and mass with indices of nutritional and developmental stress, we conclude that the lower scaled body masses of urban birds likely reflect a plastic response to predictable food supplies, possibly mediated through predation. Urban environments therefore do not necessarily constitute nutritionally stressful environments for species that typically cohabit with humans, such as house sparrows.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  18     Total Times Cited:  18     Cited Reference Count:  73 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1093/beheco/arw108     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),body condition;nutrition;passerines;phenotypic plasticity;scaled mass index (SMI);SPARROWS PASSER-DOMESTICUS;PERCEIVED PREDATION RISK;JAYS APHELOCOMA-COERULESCENS;FLUCTUATING ASYMMETRY;HOUSE SPARROWS;NUTRITIONAL CONDITION;REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS;URBAN ENVIRONMENTS;FORAGING BEHAVIOR;PARUS-MAJOR;Food,,

If competitors compete for a common resource and share the same form of the vulnerability function, then they are favored to converge on the same evolutionarily stable level of competitiveness or trade-off curve even if the parameters describing their specialized consumers differ. The position of the common strategy or trade-off curve depends on the whole guild, with more speciose guilds tending to favor higher levels of competitiveness.

However, their populations are declining in intensively farmed landscapes. Understanding the dispersal behaviour of these bees is a key step in determining how agricultural landscapes can best be enhanced for bumble bee survival. Here we develop a partial integro-differential equation model to predict the spatial distribution of foraging bumble bees in dynamic heterogeneous landscapes. In our model, the foraging population is divided into two subpopulations, one engaged in an intensive search mode (modeled by diffusion) and the other engaged in an extensive search mode (modeled by advection). Our model considers the effects of resource-dependent switching rates between movement modes, resource depletion, central-place foraging behaviour, and memory. We use our model to investigate how crop pollination services are affected by wildflower enhancements. We find that planting wildflowers such that the crop is located in between the wildflowers and the nest site can benefit crop pollination in two different scenarios. If the bees do not have a strong preference for wildflowers, a small or low density wildflower patch is beneficial.

We further analysed if elemental sulphur in lynx urine could serve as a dietary cue or as an indicator for the freshness of a scent mark. We collected urine from captive and wild Eurasian lynx, and analysed volatile constituents of urine by means of solid phase microextraction and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Our results show that lynx scent profiles contain sex-specific information on reproductive state, as well as individual identity cues. Urine marks are, therefore, well-suited to fulfil a role in reproductive behaviour and social organisation of wild lynx populations. Relative sulphur content was unrelated to time since last feeding, but decreased with age of the urine sample.

Where large populations become established they have significant and long-term effects on benthic macroinvertebrate communities. However, much less is known about how community effects associated with crayfish invasion change in the short-term as a function of varying activity levels during the summer months. We examined the macroinvertebrate community composition of two lowland UK rivers, one which supported a well-established non-native crayfish population (invaded) and one in which crayfish had not been recorded (control). Colonisation cylinders were deployed which recorded community composition over a 126-day time period. Results indicate that once the activity period commences, invasive crayfish consistently altered macroinvertebrate community structure regardless of substrate character. Invaded communities displayed reduced beta-diversity compared to control sites. However, effects on the macroinvertebrate assemblage varied over the period when crayfish were active probably reflecting the behavioural activity of crayfish (which intensifies with increasing water temperature and during the spawning season) and life histories of other macroinvertebrates. The results indicate that crayfish invasions modify macroinvertebrate community composition, but over shorter timescales, the effects vary associated with their activity levels.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  7     Total Times Cited:  7     Cited Reference Count:  75 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s10530-017-1557-3     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Colonisation;Non-native;Life-history traits;Habitat template;Fine sedimentation;NATIVE NOBLE CRAYFISH;PACIFASTACUS-LENIUSCULUS;FINE SEDIMENT;LONG-TERM;PREDATION RISK;STREAM;BEHAVIOR;CONSEQUENCES;DYNAMICS;IMPACTS,,

However, despite continual year-round hunting of bison in some populations, little is known about how the behavior of survivors may be altered. Therefore, in this initial study, we used focal-animal observations in adjacent populations of continually hunted and protected Plains bison (Bisonbisonbison) in western South Dakota, to examine the potential impact of hunting on bellowing rate-an important behavior that serves to intimidate rival bulls and potentially influences mate choice by females. In addition to hunting, we investigated how the number of attendant males, number of adult females, group size, and number of days from the start of rut influenced bellowing rate. Bulls bellowed an order of magnitude more often in the protected population than in the hunted populations, whereas bellowing rate was not significantly different in the hunted populations. Hunting was significantly and negatively associated with bellowing rate, while all other predictors were found to be positively associated with bellowing rate. Furthermore, the impact of hunting on bellowing rate became more pronounced (i.e., dampened bellowing rate more strongly) as the number of attendant males increased. Changes in bellowing behavior of bulls (and possibly mate choice by cows) can alter breeding opportunities. Therefore, our data suggest the need for studies with broader-scale geographical and temporal replication to determine the extent that continual year-round hunting has on bellowing rate of bison during the rut. If reduced bellowing is associated with human hunting on a larger scale, then wildlife managers may need to adjust hunting rate and duration, timing (season), and the time lag between hunting events in order to insure that bison are able to express their full repertoire of natural mating behaviors.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  2     Total Times Cited:  2     Cited Reference Count:  54 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.7717/peerj.3153     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Management;Bellows;Sensitization;Demography;Vocalizations;Hunting;RED DEER;HUMAN DISTURBANCE;PREDATION RISK;BEHAVIORAL-RESPONSES;CERVUS-ELAPHUS;SEX-RATIO;SELECTION;AGE;ELK;EVOLUTION,,

We discuss a diversity of ways to test SDP models empirically, taking as our main illustration a model of the daily singing routine of birds. One approach to verification is to quantify model parameters, but most SDP models are schematic. Because predictions are therefore qualitative, testing several predictions is desirable. How state determines behaviour (the policy) is a central prediction that should be examined directly if both state and behaviour are measurable. Complementary predictions concern how behaviour and state change through time, but information is discarded by considering behaviour rather than state, by looking only at average state rather than its distribution, and by not following individuals. We identify the various circumstances in which an individual's state/behaviour at one time is correlated with its state/behaviour at a later time. When there are several state variables,the relationships between them may be informative. Often model parameters represent environmental conditions that can also be viewed as state variables. Experimental manipulation of the environment has several advantages as a test, but a problem is uncertainty over how much the organism's policy will adjust. As an example we allow birds to use different assumptions about how well past weather predicts future weather. We advocate mirroring planned empirical investigations oh the computer to investigate which manipulations and predictions will best test a model.

We explore how growth, mortality, habitat use, and size influence the replacement of Orconectes sanborni by O. rusticus. In field cages, we assessed growth of crayfish. Both species grew faster when confined to riffles and O. rusticus grew faster than O. sanborni in this fast-water habitat. In another experiment, we tethered crayfish in riffles, shallow pools (<40 cm), and deep pools (>40 cm) to assess mortality. After 8 d, more crayfish were eaten in deep pools than in riffles or shallow pools. Given this finding, we predicted that crayfish should preferentially occupy high-growth, low-mortality riffles. To test this hypothesis, we quantified crayfish habitat use in sympatric streams, with and without fish predators. Crayfish did not prefer riffles. Apparently, juvenile crayfish do not assess specific benefits and costs using only food and fish predators. Other costs associated with riffles (e.g. passive drift, terrestrial predators, summer desiccation, physiological cost of position maintenance, etc.) must reduce riffle use. In addition, O. rusticus grows larger than O. sanborni. Because size confers advantages in biotic interactions, this critical finding may be the key to the replacement.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  22     Total Times Cited:  22     Cited Reference Count:  64 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1139/f93-011     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),PREDATION RISK;HABITAT USE;COMPETITIVE-EXCLUSION;BEHAVIORAL-RESPONSE;SOUTHERN ONTARIO;GENUS ORCONECTES;FORAGING MINNOWS;HEADWATER STREAM;MOUNTAIN STREAM;FISH ASSEMBLAGE,,

Glucocorticoids have a well-established role in coordinating responses to challenges and glucocorticoid levels often vary between ranks and sexes. However, the neuroendocrine mechanisms regulating glucocorticoid dynamics in wild groups are poorly understood, making it difficult to determine the functional consequences of differences in glucocorticoid levels. Therefore, we observed wild social groups of a cooperatively breeding fish (Neolamprologus pulcher) and evaluated how scale cortisol content (an emerging method to evaluate cortisol dynamics in fishes) and expression of glucocorticoid-related genes varied across group members. Scale cortisol was detectable in similar to 50% of dominant males (7/17) and females (7/15)-but not in any subordinates (0/16)-suggesting that glucocorticoid levels were higher in dominants. However, the apparent behavioural and neuroendocrine factors regulating cortisol levels varied between dominant sexes. In dominant females, higher cortisol was associated with greater rates of territory defense and increased expression of corticotropin-releasing factor in the preoptic and hypothalamic regions of the brain, but these patterns were not observed in dominant males. Additionally, transcriptional differences in the liver suggest that dominant sexes may use different mechanisms to cope with elevated cortisol levels. While dominant females appeared to reduce the relative sensitivity of their liver to cortisol (fewer corticosteroid receptor transcripts), dominant males appeared to increase hepatic cortisol breakdown (more catabolic enzyme transcripts). Overall, our results offer valuable insights on the mechanisms regulating rank- and sex-based glucocorticoid dynamics, as well as the potential functional outcomes of these differences.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  124 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.yhbeh.2021.105079     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),11 beta-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2;Corticotropin-releasing factor;Cortisol;Glucocorticoid receptors;Neolamprologus pulcher;Stress;MULTIPLE CORTICOSTEROID RECEPTORS;CORTICOTROPIN-RELEASING HORMONE;NEOLAMPROLOGUS-PULCHER PISCES;SOCIAL-STATUS;CICHLID FISH;STRESS HORMONES;PREDATION RISK;RAINBOW-TROUT;GROUP-SIZE;CORTISOL;Glucocorticoids,,

There is an unexplained tendency in the plant and animal world - with examples from alpine plants, worms, fish, mole-rats, monkeys and humans - for cooperation to flourish where the environment is more adverse (harsher) or more unpredictable.        Results: Using mathematical arguments and computer simulations we show that in more adverse environments individuals perceive their resources to be more unpredictable, and that this unpredictability favours cooperation. First we show analytically that in a more adverse environment the individual experiences greater perceived uncertainty. Second we show through a simulation study that more perceived uncertainty implies higher level of cooperation in communities of selfish individuals.        Conclusion: This study captures the essential features of the natural examples: the positive impact of resource adversity or uncertainty on cooperation. These newly discovered connections between environmental adversity, uncertainty and cooperation help to explain the emergence and evolution of cooperation in animal and human societies.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  25     Total Times Cited:  26     Cited Reference Count:  45 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1186/1471-2148-7-240     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),PREDATION RISK;POECILIA-RETICULATA;EVOLUTION;BEHAVIOR;MICROHABITAT;POPULATIONS;ASSORTMENT;RODENTS;GUPPY;RAT,,

Where mast resources were limited in favored nesting habitats, home ranges of males were larger and encompassed distant foraging patches. Squirrels used mature forest corridors to travel through plantations and harvested areas. Squirrels selected mature pine-hardwood forest, protected greenbelt riparian zones, and mature hardwood forest during nightly activity periods. Young (< 15 y old) and immature (15-40 y old) pine plantations were avoided. Snag density was correlated with squirrel density on a subset of 9 stands in which snag abundance was sampled. These results show southern flying squirrels to be selective in habitat use and sensitive to forest disturbance, not forest generalists, as has been previously reported. Forests managed to provide the greatest opportunity for the persistence of southern flying squirrels should retain protected forest along ephemeral streams within harvested areas, forested corridors connecting mature forest patches, and a mature hardwood component within the matrix of seral forests stages. The seedtree harvest regime, imposed in an already fragmented forest, appeared to represent a level of habitat alteration incompatible with successful flying squirrel occupation.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  20     Total Times Cited:  21     Cited Reference Count:  56 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1078/1616-5047-113     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Glaucomys volans;habitat selection;home range;GLAUCOMYS-VOLANS;PREDATION RISK;NEST SITES;ABUNDANCE;MICROHABITAT;RED;AVAILABILITY;POPULATIONS;DIVERSITY;SYSTEMS;Trees,,

We have limited understanding of how people think and talk about CSPs, how beliefs are transmitted across generations, and how this might affect the practice. This paper explores these issues to understand how CSPs are perpetuated and help identify opportunities for interventions to modify them.        Methods: The study employed an ethnographic research design involving: participant observation in 10 households, 60 in-depth interviews (IDIs), and nine participatory focus group discussions (FGDs). Participants were young people aged 14-24 and parents/carers of young people within this age group. The 60 IDIs were conducted with: 17 fathers, 13 mothers, 13 young men and 17 young women (six of whom had had unplanned pregnancies and 11 had no children). The nine FGDs were conducted with groups of: fathers (2), mothers (2), young women (2), and young men (3). A discourse analysis was carried out with all the transcripts. Data were analysed with the aid of NVIVO 8 software.        Results: Six distinct discourses were identified from the way participants talked about CSPs and the norms driving the practice: 1) predatory masculine sexuality; 2) masculine respectability; 3) feminine respectability; 4) empowered modern women; 5) traditional health beliefs; 6) public health. Discourses legitimating CSPs were drawn on and reproduced primarily by young people and the media and only indirectly by parents. Discourses discouraging CSPs were used primarily by parents, religious leaders and learning institutions and only indirectly by young people themselves.        Conclusion: Better knowledge of the discourses through which young people CSPs, and how these discourses are transmitted across generations, might help develop ""culturally compelling"" interventions that modify these discourses to enhance sexual health.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  8     Total Times Cited:  8     Cited Reference Count:  48 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1186/1471-2458-14-742     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Concurrent sexual partnerships;Discourses;Tanzania;HIV/AIDS;Young people;BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTIONS;TRANSACTIONAL SEX;SOUTHERN AFRICA;HIV PREVENTION;RISK;PREVALENCE;EPIDEMICS;DYNAMICS;PROMOTE;EXPLAIN;Parenting,,

The role of parental care in determining reproductive success was investigated in Wood Storks (Mycteria americana), and specifically how the trade-off between frequency and duration of foraging trips and nest protection contributed to the nesting outcome. Parental behavior of 85 pairs of Wood Storks was monitored throughout the nesting season in two breeding colonies in Palm Beach County, Florida, USA. Wood Storks gradually increased the frequency, but not the duration, of foraging trips as chicks developed. The ratio of hatchlings to fledglings was positively associated with the frequency of foraging trips during late chick development. Intra-specific aggressions resulting in nest takeovers affected 32% of the nests. Occurrence of nest takeovers were higher for later-breeding pairs, and happened primarily in the first few weeks of incubation, but was not affected by the degree of joint nest attendance of both parents. These results establish a functional link between parental effort and reproductive outcome in Wood Storks, and highlight the importance of frequent foraging trips, but not nest attendance, by parents.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  65 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1675/063.043.0202     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),foraging ecology;foraging trips;intraspecific aggression;nest attendance;nest ecology;nest takeover;parental care;stork;EAST-CENTRAL GEORGIA;PARENTAL CARE;BREEDING SUCCESS;PREDATION RISK;FLORIDA;SIZE;POPULATION;COLONIES;SURVIVAL;ECOLOGY,,

In this study we unite these concepts by empirically testing for density-dependent functional responses in habitat selection using a large herbivore, elk Cervus canadensis manitobensis, as a model species. Theory on density-dependent habitat selection predicts specialised behaviour when densities are low with a gradual switch to generalist behaviour (more even selection of habitat) as competition intensifies. This suggests that functional responses in habitat selection should be positive when competition is low, but that density may have a negative effect on the functional response due to constraining effects of competition on habitat use and availability. We tested this prediction using data from Global Positioning System (GPS) collared elk (n = 33) and empirical data on spatiotemporal variation in local density during winter in Riding Mountain National Park, Manitoba, Canada (2002-2011). As local density increased, winter home range size decreased and the proportion of mixed forest (providing shelter and forage to elk) used and available within the home range also decreased. Our resource selection function (RSF) revealed clear density-dependent effects in selection, being strongest (or weakest) for high quality (or low quality) habitat types at lowest observed density leading to more even selection as densities increased. The functional response in mixed forest selection was negatively affected by local density. Increasing availability of mixed forest in the home range was associated with higher selection at low density (positive functional response); no effect of availability on selection at moderate density (no functional response); and lower selection as availability increased at high density (negative functional response). Our study demonstrates that this process is largely driven by the negative effect of density on home range size as it constrains use and availability of habitat.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  32     Total Times Cited:  32     Cited Reference Count:  58 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/ecog.01339     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),RESOURCE SELECTION;SEXUAL SEGREGATION;SPATIAL MODELS;PREDATION RISK;TRADE-OFFS;HOME-RANGE;SCALE;ELK;FAMILIARITY;POPULATION,,

Recently, a trophic interaction among invasive green crabs (Carcinus maenas) and native dogwhelks (Nucella lapillus) foraging on mussels (Mytilus spp.) in Atlantic Canada was reported, in which a mussel initially attacked by a dogwhelk was then eaten by a crab. This was interpreted as kleptoparasitism, but alternatively could be scavenging of abandoned mussel prey. In this paper, mathematical models of kleptoparasitism and scavenging among these species were developed and used to generate predicted feeding rates, which were then compared to observations from previous work. The available evidence for kleptoparasitism by green crabs on dogwhelks was also considered and compared to hypothesized outcomes of these different foraging modes. The evidence considered does not definitively suggest that scavenging was previously misidentified as kleptoparasitism; in fact, model simulations were only able to match observed foraging when they included kleptoparasitism. Effects of crab kleptoparasitism on whelks were shown to be negative, while crab scavenging had effectively no impact on whelks; therefore, while these two foraging interactions appear superficially similar, they have very different implications and should be carefully distinguished in future studies.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  5     Total Times Cited:  5     Cited Reference Count:  56 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s00227-016-2964-1     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),NUCELLA-LAPILLUS L;MYTILUS-GALLOPROVINCIALIS;INTERFERENCE COMPETITION;FUNCTIONAL-RESPONSE;MULTIPLE PREDATORS;CASE-HISTORY;DOGWHELKS;BEHAVIOR;RISK;POPULATIONS,,

Here, we measured how both parental and offspring performance varied in nest sites distributed along an environmental gradient.        The plainfin midshipman fish Porichthys notatus nests along a tidal gradient. When ascending from the subtidal to the high intertidal at low tide, both nest temperature and frequency of air exposure increase. We used one lab and two field experiments to investigate how parental nest site choices across tidal elevations are linked to the physiological costs incurred by parents and the developmental benefits accrued by offspring.        Under warmer incubation conditions, simulating high intertidal nests, offspring developed faster but had higher mortality rates compared to those incubated in cooler conditions that mimicked subtidal nests.        In the field, males in higher intertidal nests were more active caregivers, but their young still died at the fastest rates. Larger males claimed and retained low intertidal nests, where offspring survival and development rates were also highest.        Our results suggest that males compete more intensively for nest sites in the low intertidal, where they can raise their young quickly and with lower per-offspring investments. Smaller, less-competitive males forced into higher intertidal sites nest earlier in the season and provide more active parental care, possibly to bolster brood survival under harsh environmental conditions.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  2     Total Times Cited:  2     Cited Reference Count:  66 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/1365-2656.13385     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),environmental gradient;fitness trade&#8208;offs;parental care;plainfin midshipman;reproductive strategies;reproductive success;MALE PLAINFIN MIDSHIPMAN;PARENT-OFFSPRING CONFLICT;PREDATION RISK;REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS;ADAPTIVE PLASTICITY;SPAWNING SUCCESS;BODY CONDITION;SIZE;BEHAVIOR;ARRIVAL,,

We examined environmental variables correlated with the spatial distribution of eastern Pacific harbor seals (Phoca vitulina richardii), a marine mammal common to coastal waters, in a large, highly urbanized estuary. We assessed the relationship between prey abundance, depth, bottom relief, proximity to terrestrial haul-out sites and 3 potential sources of anthropogenic influence, and the in-water spatial distribution of seals. We identified locations of seals using satellite-linked telemetry, and used partial Mantel tests to assess which environmental variables were most strongly linked to seal foraging distribution, given spatial autocorrelation within variables. Mann Whitney tests were used to compare environmental characteristics of locations of seals with a random distribution of locations. Because harbor seals are central-place foragers, we incorporated spatial distribution of seals relative to the central place into our analyses. High prey abundance and proximity to the haul-out site were strongly associated with the spatial distribution of seals. Harbor seals also tended to use deeper waters and areas of high bottom relief within the estuary. There was no consistent spatial relationship between the 3 anthropogenic factors and the distribution of seals, although seals tended to be found closer than expected to sites of high human activity. In highly impacted coastal areas where limited alternate suitable habitat exists, foraging seals may need to rely on disturbed (suboptimal) areas, and as a result may habituate to human presence in areas rich in food resources.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  11     Total Times Cited:  12     Cited Reference Count:  89 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1644/11-MAMM-A-128.1     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),central-place forager;disturbance;geographic information system;habitat use;harbor seal;Phoca vitulina;satellite telemetry;spatial distribution;SAN-FRANCISCO BAY;PRINCE-WILLIAM-SOUND;HAUL-OUT PATTERNS;BEHAVIORAL-RESPONSES;POPULATION-DYNAMICS;SATELLITE-TRACKING;HABITAT SELECTION;PREDATION RISK;DISTURBANCE;DENSITY,,

Its impact is expected to be especially severe in the tropics, where organisms have evolved in more physically stable conditions relative to temperate ecosystems. Lake Tanganyika (eastern Africa) is one ecosystem experiencing rapid warming, yet our understanding of how its diverse assemblage of endemic species will respond is incomplete. Herein, we conducted a laboratory experiment to assess how anticipated future warming would affect the mirror-elicited aggressive behaviour of Julidochromis ornatus, a common endemic cichlid in Lake Tanganyika. Given linkages that have been established between temperature and individual behaviour in fish and other animals, we hypothesized that water warming would heighten average individual aggression. Our findings support this hypothesis, suggesting the potential for water warming to mediate behavioural phenotypic expression through negative effects associated with individual health (body condition). We ultimately discuss the implications of our findings for efforts aimed at understanding how continued climate warming will affect the ecology of Lake Tanganyika fishes and other tropical ectotherms.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  6     Total Times Cited:  6     Cited Reference Count:  121 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1038/s41598-020-76780-1     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),LAKE TANGANYIKA;CLIMATE-CHANGE;CICHLID FISH;ENERGY-METABOLISM;PREDATION RISK;LIFE-HISTORY;INTRASPECIFIC AGGRESSION;COMPETITIVE AGGRESSION;TERRITORIAL AGGRESSION;JULIDOCHROMIS-ORNATUS;Aggression,,

Procellariiform seabirds provide particularly appropriate models for investigating these topics as they possess a well-developed olfactory system and unequalled associated capabilities. We present here results from a detailed chemical examination of the uropygial secretions (the main source of avian exogenous chemicals) from 2 petrel species, Antarctic prions and blue petrels. Using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry techniques and recently developed multivariate tools, we demonstrate that the secretions contain critical socioecological information such as species, gender, and individual identity. Importantly, these chemosignals correlate with some of the birds' olfactory behaviors demonstrated in the field. The molecules found to be associated with social information were essentially large unsaturated compounds, suggesting that these may be precursors of, or correlates to the actual airborne signals. Although the species-specific chemosignal may be involved in interspecific competition at the breeding grounds, the role of the sexually specific chemosignal remains unclear. The existence of individually specific signals (i.e., chemical signatures) in these birds has important implications for processes such as individual recognition and genetically based mate choice already suspected for this group. Our results open promising avenues of research for the study of avian chemical communication.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  67     Total Times Cited:  67     Cited Reference Count:  70 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1093/chemse/bjq021     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),chemical communication;compatibility-based mate choice;distance-based multivariate statistics;GCMS;individual signature;olfaction;OLFACTORY SIGNATURE;ODOR RECOGNITION;CHEMICAL COMMUNICATION;GENETIC COMPATIBILITY;HALOBAENA-CAERULEA;SEXUAL SELECTION;FEEDING ECOLOGY;ILES-KERGUELEN;PREDATION RISK;BLUE PETRELS,,

They run on resources foraged from an outside world fraught with danger. On what basis do individual ants decide to leave the safety of the nest? We investigated the relative roles of social information (returning nestmates), individual experience and physiology (lipid stores/corpulence) in predicting which ants leave the nest and when. We monitored Temnothorax albipennis workers individually using passive radio-frequency identification technology, a novel procedure as applied to ants. This method allowed the matching of individual corpulence measurements to activity patterns of large numbers of individuals over several days. Social information and physiology are both good predictors of when an ant leaves the nest. Positive feedback from social information causes bouts of activity at the colony level. When certain social information is removed from the system by preventing ants returning, physiology best predicts which ants leave the nest and when. Individual experience is strongly related to physiology. A small number of lean individuals are responsible for most external trips. An individual's nutrient status could be a useful cue in division of labour, especially when public information from other ants is unavailable.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  82     Total Times Cited:  83     Cited Reference Count:  58 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s00265-008-0696-z     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Division of labour;Foraging;RFID;Physiology;Ant;Temnothorax;DIVISION-OF-LABOR;HARVESTER ANT;TASK-PERFORMANCE;PREDATION RISK;LIFE-HISTORY;NEST;COLONY;POGONOMYRMEX;BEHAVIOR;FOOD;Decision Making,,

This leaves males with higher potential rates of reproduction, and a likelihood of sexual conflict, including, in some systems, coercive matings. If coercive matings are costly, the best female strategy may be to avoid male interaction. We present a model that demonstrates female movement in response to male harassment as a mechanism to lower the costs associated with male coercion, and the effect that female movement has on selection in males for male harassment. We found that, when females can move from a habitat patch to a refuge to which males do not have access, there may be a selection for either high, or low harassment male phenotype, or both, depending on the relationship between the harassment level of male types in the population and a threshold level of male harassment. This threshold harassment level depends on the relative number of males and females in the population, and the relative resource values of the habitat; the threshold increases as the sex ratio favours females, and decreases with the value of the refuge patch or total population. Our model predicts that selection will favour the harassment level that lies closest to this threshold level of harassment, and differing harassment levels will coexist within the population only if they lie on the opposite sides of the threshold harassment. Our model is consistent with empirical results suggesting that an intermediate harassment level provides maximum reproductive fitness to males when females are mobile.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  1     Total Times Cited:  1     Cited Reference Count:  28 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1098/rspb.2012.0246     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),coercive mating system;female refuge;harassment;selection;sexual conflict;WATER STRIDERS;EASTERN MOSQUITOFISH;POECILIA-RETICULATA;PREDATION RISK;CONFLICT;BEHAVIOR;COMPETITION;DIMORPHISM;HARASSMENT;EVOLUTION,,

We found an influence of items per midden and prey species maximum size on these indices. In Puget Sound, middens and common prey species were large, richness, R = 21 species, and individuals specialized more often than in other areas, typically on large prey species. In Saanich Inlet, British Columbia, middens were smaller, R = 9 species, and the large crab Cancer productus was common in nearly all middens, such that the population specialized rather than the individual. In Prince William Sound, Alaska, middens contained fewer individuals of smaller prey species, R = 52 species, and diet was generalized at both the population and the individual levels. Cardona's niche breadth ranged from .11 to .14 except in the Aleutian Islands, Alaska where it was higher (.30).

Correlations between gag space use (distance from the reef, distance from the seafloor, and travel speed) and environmental conditions (bottom type, time of day, lunar phase, and water temperature, speed and flow direction) showed gag typically using space near, but not directly at the reef. The 50% and 95% kernel density contours fell within 17 and 39 m of the reef, respectively, though gag spent the most time about 10 m from the reef. All individuals made occasional excursions beyond their primary space-use areas. Gag spent 86% of the time within 2.5 m of the seafloor, with periods of frequent or extended movement up to 9 m from the seafloor, usually near the reef. On average, gag moved about 25% farther from the reef during the day; correlations with other environmental conditions were weak or unclear.

Each action has a certain probability of giving the agent an energy reward, and costs may be associated with switching between actions. The agent does not know which action has the highest reward probability, and the probabilities change randomly over time. We study two learning rules that have been widely used to model decision-making processes in animals one deterministic and the other stochastic. In particular, we examine the influence of the rules' 'learning rate' on the agent's energy gain. We compare the performance of each rule with the best performance attainable when the agent has either full knowledge or no knowledge of the environment. Over relatively short periods of time, both rules are successful in enabling agents to exploit their environment. Moreover, under a range of effective learning rates, both rules are equivalent, and can be expressed by a third rule that requires the agent to select the action for which the current run of unsuccessful trials is shortest. However, the performance of both rules is relatively poor over longer periods of time, and under most circumstances no better than the performance an agent could achieve without knowledge of the environment. We propose a simple extension to the original rules that enables agents to learn about and effectively exploit a changing environment for an unlimited period of time.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  30     Total Times Cited:  30     Cited Reference Count:  49 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1098/rsif.2007.1348     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),decision making;learning rules;dynamic environments;multi-armed bandit;2-ARMED BANDIT;INDIVIDUAL DECISIONS;FORAGING STRATEGIES;PATCHY ENVIRONMENT;RISK-SENSITIVITY;ANIMAL BEHAVIOR;EXPLOITATION;PREDATORS;HONEYBEES;PREY;Learning,,

These experiments have inspired a body of theoretical work to explain the variation in the effect of warming on top-down control. However, there has been no quantitative attempt to reconcile theory with outcomes from empirical studies. To address the gap between theory and experiment, we performed a meta-analysis to examine the combined effect of experimental warming and top-down control on resource biomass and determined potential sources of variation across experiments. We show that differences in experimental outcomes are related to systematic variation in the geographical distribution of studies. Specifically, warming strengthened top-down control when experiments were conducted in colder regions, but had the opposite effect in warmer regions. Furthermore, we found that differences in the thermoregulation strategy of the consumer and openness of experimental arenas to dispersal can contribute to some deviation from the overall geographical pattern. These results reconcile empirical findings and support the expectation of geographical variation in the response of consumer-resource interactions to warming.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  24     Total Times Cited:  25     Cited Reference Count:  87 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/ele.12913     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Climate change;consumer-resource interaction;ecological contingency;geographical gradient;meta-analysis;temperature;top-down control;TEMPERATURE-DEPENDENCE;CLIMATE-CHANGE;TROPHIC INTERACTIONS;PREDATION RISK;BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY;MODEL SELECTION;FOOD-CHAINS;BOTTOM-UP;CONSUMER;IMPACTS,,

In cases in which gynogens do not invest in male function, they can potentially have a twofold competitive advantage over sexuals because the asexuals avoid the cost of producing males. If unmitigated, however, the competitive success of the asexuals would ultimately lead to their own demise, following the extinction of the sexual species that stimulate egg development. We have studied a model of mate choice among sexual individuals and asexual gynogens, where males of the sexual species preferentially mate with sexual females over gynogenetic females, to determine if such mating preferences can stably maintain both gynogenetic and sexual individuals within a community. Our model shows that stable coexistence of gynogens and their sexual hosts can occur when there is variation among males in the degree of preference for mating with sexual females and when pickier males pay a higher cost of preference.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  17     Total Times Cited:  17     Cited Reference Count:  48 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/j.1558-5646.2010.01047.x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Evolution of sex;gynogenesis;hybridization;phoxinus eos-neogaeus;sperm-dependent asexuals;NORTHERN REDBELLY DACE;ROCK-PAPER-SCISSORS;PHOXINUS-EOS;REPRODUCTIVE-BEHAVIOR;MIXED POPULATIONS;RANA-ESCULENTA;PREDATION RISK;EVOLUTION;POECILIA;FEMALES,,

In this study, radio-telemetry was used to observe the movements of 98 adult brown trout, Salmo trutta, in oligotrophic streams with different population densities; to determine subpopulation site fidelity, 5,195 conspecifics from 14 subpopulations were individually tagged during spring and autumn. During a 7-year-long field study, we tested the hypothesis that brown trout individuals from subpopulations with high site fidelity would display lower movement. The hypothesis was supported, and reduced movement was further related to high subpopulation density in association with high slope indicating the physical environment-influenced movement. The probability of contact between individuals increased with subpopulation site fidelity and subpopulation density. No influence of food abundance on brown trout movement was found. Furthermore, increased body size predicted higher movement (and vice versa). The least movement occurred during the day and during the full moons.

Valued as an important component of the natural heritage of the northeastern United States, anadromous river herring (Alosa pseudoharengus, A. aestivalis) represent a model system to look at how ecological data can help conserve biological diversity in systems impacted by humans. Juvenile river herring spend 3-7 months in freshwater then migrate to the ocean. However, factors that trigger migration, and consequently influence distribution and abundance, are not well understood. Thus, our objectives in this study were to (1) describe juvenile river herring migration patterns, both ""peak"" (>1000 fish/wk) and ""all"" (>30 fish/wk) migration; (2) identify potential cues for this migration; (3) examine effects of one, type of ecosystem alteration, low water levels, on river herring; and (4) suggest how this information can be incorporated into an effective conservation plan. Weekly during June-November 1994, we sampled both migrating and nonmigrating river herring and seven associated abiotic and biotic variables in one continuous and one intermittent flow system on Cape Cod, Massachusetts. We then used multiple logistic regression to predict when juvenile river herring migrate. In the continuous-flow system, juvenile river herring migration primarily occurred during the midday hours from July through early November, with the peaks of migration, comprising >96% of all migrating fish observed in early July and early September.. The peaks of migration occurred during the new moon, when Bosmina spp. density was low, and all periods of migration occurred when water visibility was low, during decreased amounts of rainfall. In the intermittent flow system, juvenile river herring migration was frequently inhibited due to low water levels, and herring were on average 25 mm smaller than those in the continuous flow system. Using these results, managers can more effectively monitor river herring populations by identifying factors associated with migration and isolating critical flow periods when fish movement is likely to occur. Thus, we can detect changes in herring population size due to human impacts. Ultimately, these data can be incorporated into an ecologically sound conservation plan for juvenile anadromous herring that may help ensure their survival while balancing human needs for natural resources.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  32     Total Times Cited:  32     Cited Reference Count:  90 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1890/1051-0761(2002)012[0521:MFMOAH]2.0.CO;2     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),"Alosa aestivalis;Alosa pseudoharengus;anadromous river herring;balancing conservation with development;Bosmina spp.;Cape Cod, Massachusetts (USA);conservation;land use;migration;sustainability;water use;JUVENILE AMERICAN SHAD;ATLANTIC SALMON;ECOSYSTEM MANAGEMENT;SEAWARD MIGRATION;ALOSA-PSEUDOHARENGUS;VERTICAL MIGRATION;CONNECTICUT RIVER;FEEDING-BEHAVIOR;CLUPEA-HARENGUS;PREDATION RISK",,

We used thread bobbins to track movement and calculate straight-line distance (SLD) moved, total distance (TDM) moved, and occupied area for individual snakes. Microhabitat use was characterized by quantifying number of trees, woody vegetation stems, herbaceous vegetation stems, percent grass coverage, and percent canopy coverage at each location a snake was observed, and at an equal number of randomly selected locations. Neither SLD nor TDM differed between fragmented and unfragmented habitats. Overall average SLD moved was 24.1 m and TDM was 39.6 m over 48 h. Although SLD and TDM did not differ between sites, mean occupied area +/- standard error was significantly greater at the unfragmented (2,310.9 +/-- 272.7 m) compared with the fragmented site (1,025.9 +/-- 314.9 m). Microhabitat features were similar between the fragmented and unfragmented sites, and herbaceous vegetation and high canopy cover were associated with locations where snakes were observed at both sites. It is likely that Eastern Copperheads can persist in a variety of habitats in the southeastern United States because their preferred microhabitat features are widely distributed and common in both fragmented and unfragmented environments, demonstrating that they retain characteristics of a habitat specialist within heterogeneous environments suitable for generalists.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  2     Total Times Cited:  2     Cited Reference Count:  93 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1670/18-146     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),HOPLOCEPHALUS-BUNGAROIDES SERPENTES;BLACK RAT SNAKES;BEHAVIORAL THERMOREGULATION;AGKISTRODON-CONTORTRIX;SPECIES-DIVERSITY;LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY;ATLANTIC FOREST;PREDATION RISK;HOME-RANGE;TRADE-OFFS,,

Roads are a widespread form of human development that carnivores may perceive as efficient travel routes or centers of human activity and associated risk. We compared the spatio-temporal responses of carnivores to human road use with high-resolution tracking of a large carnivore guild including American black bears (Ursus americans), bobcats (Lynx rufus), coyotes (Canis latrans), and wolves (C. lupus) in Michigan, USA. All carnivores selected for roads when traveling at night but avoided roads during the day when human activity was greatest. Human activity explained 90% of temporal variation in road use across carnivore species, with a 3.2-3.7-fold increase in road use at times of low human activity which reduced carnivore activity overlap with humans by 27-42%. Similar but less pronounced activity changes occurred in areas up to 500 m from roads. Bears and wolves increased nocturnal activity with more roads in their home range, but not bobcats or coyotes. Despite increased diurnal activity in areas farther from roads, temporal overlap among carnivores was high regardless of mad proximity. Our results suggest that spatio-temporal responses to roads were similar among carnivores and emphasized avoidance of humans over other carnivore species. Further, we provide support that carnivores can be diurnally active while avoiding humans by using areas farther from roads. However, carnivores which are primarily diurnal (e.g., black bears) or have a strong proclivity for using roads (e.g., wolves) likely require greater behavioral changes to avoid humans. Behavioral adaptations allowing multiple species to use and cross roads while avoiding humans are encouraging for human-carnivore coexistence.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  3     Total Times Cited:  3     Cited Reference Count:  92 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.gecco.2021.e01772     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Canis latrans;Canis lupus;Human disturbance;Lynx rufus;Movement ecology;Temporal activity;Roads;Ursus americans;BLACK BEAR;TERRESTRIAL;MOVEMENT;MOUNTAINS;PREDATOR;HABITAT;WOLVES;BOBCAT;PREY;FRAGMENTATION;Humanities;Humanism;Humans,,

We used an animal model of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) to assess long-term behavioral effects of a single dose of NPS, microinjected into the basolateral amygdala (BLA) 1 h following exposure to predator-scent stress (PSS). To elucidate the molecular mechanism by which NPS attenuates behavioral stress responses, expression levels of neuropeptide Y (NPY), NPY-Y1 receptor (NPY-Y1R), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were evaluated in the hippocampus. The behavioral and molecular effects of NPS receptor antagonist (NPS-RA), NPY-Y1 R antagonist (NPY-Y1RA), or both administered centrally were evaluated in the same manner. Circulating corticosterone levels were measured at different time points following PSSexposure. Immediate post-exposure treatment with NPS had a marked protective effect; BLA microinfusion of NPS completely abolished the extreme behavioral response to PSS, restored the decreased expression of BDNF and, unexpectedly, PY-Y1R, but didn't affect the decreased expression of NPY. BLA microinfusion of both NPY-Y1 RA and NPS-RA together had an additive effect, which completely prevented the anxiolytic effects of NPS in rats exposed to PSS and disrupted the expression of NPY-Y1R in the hippocampus following NPS infusion. It may therefore be hypothesized that NPS acts, directly or indirectly, on both the NPY-Y1R and NPS receptors and that the cross-talk between NPS and NPY-Y1R may be necessary for the anxiolytic effects of NPS post-exposure. The NPS system might thus contribute to a potential endogenous mechanism underlying the shift towards adaptive behavioral response and thereby might be relevant as a pharmacological target for attenuating stress-related sequelae.

Avian Biol.,25,4,319-326,"LIMA, SL",,English,,,"Current treatments of collective detection hold that all members of the flock are alerted to predatory attack as long as at least one flock member detects it.  This presumes that the individual(s) detecting attack somehow signal unambiguously that an attack is in progress.  Alarm calls may provide such unambiguous signals, but for the many bird species lacking such calls, departures from the flock may be the main source of information on predator detection.  These departures might themselves be considered alarm signals, but as such they are ambiguous, since departures may not be predator-driven.  Thus non-detectors must decide whether to initiate escape behavior based upon the anti-predator information available in the departures.  A mathematical exploration of this ''departure information'' reveals that multiple departures over a short time interval may be effectively required to sound the alarm in a flock.  In fact, single detections (or departures) may usually go unheeded by other flock members.  The information available to non-detectors in multiple departures varies considerably with the rate of non-predator-driven departures, attack rates, and flock size.  In general, however, a good predator detection rule-of-thumb is likely to be:  flee to safety with the simultaneous departures of two or more individuals, otherwise assess the reason for single departures before taking such action.

There is no sexual difference in FTB for D. brazili, and no relationship between tail breakage and snout-vent length (SVL). For D. dicrous, tail breakage is more frequently observed in males when specimens are <710 mm SVL, but for longer specimens, the FTB is higher in females; this strange pattern may not be explained by a single hypothesis. The FTB does not vary significantly between disjunct populations of D. dichrous, suggesting that they are subject to similar predation pressures and escape rates, or minor or no effect of habitat structure on predation risk. The FTB increases with SVL in D. dichrous (but not in D. brazili, probably due to sample size), which is an indication that as the snake grows, the chance of being injured increases and partial tail loss becomes an efficient defense.

Here, we use a new prototype predation tag coupled with RFID telemetry on 49 individuals from one of the largest sea lamprey European populations (Southwestern France) to quantify the risk of predation for adult sea lampreys during its spawning migration in rivers with large populations of European catfish. We found that at least 80% of tagged sea lampreys (39 among 49) were preyed upon within one month, and that 50% of the released lampreys were rapidly consumed on average 8 days after tagging. This very high predation rate suggests that the European catfish represents a supplementary serious threat of extirpation for the native sea lamprey population we studied. This threat is likely to happen throughout most of the native lamprey distribution area, as the European catfish is becoming established almost everywhere the sea lamprey is.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  15     Total Times Cited:  15     Cited Reference Count:  38 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1038/s41598-020-62916-w     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),CATFISH SILURUS-GLANIS;PETROMYZON-MARINUS;EUROPEAN CATFISH;FISH;CONSERVATION;MANAGEMENT;LAMPETRA;BEHAVIOR;IMPACTS;ECOLOGY;Prednisolone,,

In the Jackson elk herd of northwest Wyoming, demographic differences between summer elk (Cervus elaphus) population segments have led to changes in migratory patterns over a 35-year time period. The proportion of short-distance migrants (SDM) has increased and the proportion of long-distance migrants (LDM) has concurrently declined. The probability of winter-captured elk on the National Elk Refuge being LDM decreased from 0.99 (95% CI=0.97-1.00) to 0.59 (95% CI=0.47-0.70) from 1978 to 2012. We tested 4 hypotheses that could contribute toward the decline in the LDM segment: behavioral switching from LDM to SDM, differential survival, harvest availability, and calf recruitment. Switching rates from LDM to SDM were very low (0.2% each elk-year). Survival rates were similar between LDM and SDM, although harvest availability was relatively low for SDM that tended to use areas close to human development during the hunting season. Average summer calf/cow ratios of LDM declined from 42 to 23 calves per 100 cows from 1978-1984 to 2006-2012. Further, during 2006-2012, LDM summer calf/cow ratios were less than half of SDM (23 vs. 47 calves per 100 cows). Our data suggest recruitment is the driving factor behind the declining proportion of LDM in this region. Effectiveness of altering harvest management strategies to conserve the LDM portion of the Jackson elk herd may be limited. Published 2015.

In freshwater habitats, salmonid fishes are one of the most common introduced predators worldwide. Most studies of effects of salmonids on native prey species have focused on direct predation, with fewer studies examining how behavior of prey is affected. We used a snorkeling protocol to examine whether introduction of rainbow (Oncorhyuchus mykiss) and brown (Salmo trutta) trout in streams was associated with increased wariness in two small prey fishes, darters in the genus Etheostoma. Wariness was measured as flight initiation distance (FID), the distance at which individuals flee from an approaching threat (snorkeler), for darters in four rivers with and four rivers without introduced trout. Darters in rivers with trout had longer FIDs, indicating that they were less tolerant of risk than darters in control rivers. Increased wariness could lead to darters decreasing activities associated with foraging and reproduction, which could have long-term negative effects on populations of these prey fishes.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  1     Total Times Cited:  1     Cited Reference Count:  49 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s10750-021-04561-6     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Predation;Introduced trout;Salmonid fishes;Rainbow darters;Orangethroat darters;Flight initiation distance,,

The analysis is general, but we focus on two specific cases: the level of display of a male trying to attract a female and the level of effort of a parent caring for young. In each case, an increase in the level of behaviour increases the risk of mortality. The analysis is based on a consideration of how the performance of a high-quality individual relative to a lower-quality individual depends on behaviour. If relative performance increases, then higher-quality individuals are predicted to work harder; conversely, if relative performance decreases, then higher-quality individuals are predicted to work less hard. We also analyse the consequences of optimal behaviour. In particular, we show that the young of a high-quality parent may have a lower survival probability than the young of a lower-quality parent. We highlight other cases in which fitness has a product form, but where the product terms are not necessarily survival and reproduction. Our analysis still applies to these cases and again shows that relative, rather than absolute, perfomance is the appropriate biological variable to consider.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  8     Total Times Cited:  8     Cited Reference Count:  35 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",,condition-dependent effort;courtship;quality;relative performance;signals;COMPETITIVE ABILITY;GROUP-SIZE;EVOLUTION;PREDATION;SELECTION;VIABILITY;SUCCESS;SIGNALS;MALES,,

We assume that prey species can evolve safer strategies such that it can reduce the predation risk, but this has a cost in terms of its reproduction. First, by using the method of critical function analysis, we identify the general properties of trade-off functions that allow for continuously stable strategy and evolutionary branching in the prey strategy. It is found that if the trade-off curve is globally concave, then the evolutionarily singular strategy is continuously stable. However, if the trade-off curve is concave-convex-concave and the prey's sensitivity to crowding is not strong, then the evolutionarily singular strategy may be an evolutionary branching point, near which the resident and mutant prey can coexist and diverge in their strategies. Second, we find that after branching has occurred in the prey strategy, if the trade-off curve is concave-convex-concave, the prey population will eventually evolve into two different types, which can coexist on the long-term evolutionary timescale. The algebraical analysis reveals that an attractive dimorphism will always be evolutionarily stable and that no further branching is possible for the concave-convex-concave trade-off relationship.

Conspecific populations living in habitats with different risks of predation often show phenotypic variation in defensive traits. Traits of two species of mayflies (Baetidae: Baetis bicaudatus and Baetis sp. nov.) differ between populations living in fish and fishless streams in a high altitude drainage basin in western Colorado, U.S.A. We tested for genetic differentiation between mayfly populations in these two habitat types, assuming that lack of genetic differentiation would be consistent with the hypothesis that those traits are phenotypically plastic.        2. Previous work has shown that larvae of both species behave differently and undergo different developmental pathways in adjacent fish and fishless streams. These phenotypic differences in behaviour and development have been induced experimentally, suggesting that populations from fishless streams have the genetic capability to respond to fish.        3. During summer 2001 we collected Baetis larvae from several fish and fishless streams, and from fish and fishless sections of the same streams. We used allozymes and a fragment of the cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 mitochondrial gene to examine genetic variation of Baetis individuals within and among streams.        4. Results showed that genetic variation exists among populations of the same species of Baetis from different streams, but none of that variation was associated with the presence or absence of fish. These data confirm that populations of Baetis living in fish and fishless streams are not genetically distinct, and are consistent with the hypothesis that traits associated with environments of different risk are phenotypically plastic.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  16     Total Times Cited:  17     Cited Reference Count:  60 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/j.1365-2427.2004.01292.x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),allozymes;fish and fishless streams;genetic differentiation;mayflies;mitochondrial DNA;BAETIS-BICAUDATUS EPHEMEROPTERA;GENE FLOW;LIFE-HISTORY;ADAPTIVE PLASTICITY;SIZE;DNA;MORPHOLOGY;DISPERSAL;PREDATION;EVOLUTION,,

Males must decide how to distribute food between their females and food allocation patterns are often highly unequal. In turn, the females that receive less food from males have to decide how much time to invest in additional hunting. If they spend more time hunting, then they leave their young exposed to weather and predators. However, if they stay at the nest, they increase the risk of their chicks starving. One way that birds may compensate for reduced provisioning is by increasing the size of prey caught. We tested this hypothesis by comparing prey deliveries to nests of hen harriers, Circus cyaneus, with females of different breeding status. As expected, male harriers delivered less food items to the nests of polygynous females, and especially their secondary, or beta females. However, both sexes were able to compensate by delivering larger items and there was no difference in the overall mass of food delivered to nests. Moreover, females spent a similar amount of time at the nest, irrespective of status, and there were no overall differences in breeding success. Our results show that polygynous female harriers can compensate for the costs of polygyny, but we suggest that their ability to do so will vary according to the abundance of both large prey and predators.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  14     Total Times Cited:  15     Cited Reference Count:  32 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s00265-006-0176-2     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),polygyny;provisioning;parental care;harriers;Circus cyaneus;MALE PARENTAL CARE;FLYCATCHER FICEDULA-HYPOLEUCA;RED-WINGED BLACKBIRDS;REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS;AGELAIUS-PHOENICEUS;NORTHERN HARRIERS;NESTLINGS;PREY;CONFLICT;POLYGAMY,,

Individuals feeding close together experience increased competition so that the feeding rate decreases. Widely spaced individuals may suffer a loss in vigilance efficiency, since communication between individuals is more difficult, such that the predation risk increases. A vigilance model is developed which allows birds to control their spacing (and so the area of the flock) as well as their vigilance rate. The best strategy for the birds is found under a variety of environmental conditions, under the assumption that each individual acts selfishly to maximize its own fitness.

In the second experiment, one leaf again had ovipositing models, while the other had models of uncoupled males and females in a resting posture. In both experiments, damselfly pairs preferred the site with ovipositing models. In general, they visited the ovipositing models first more often than expected by chance, stayed longer there, were more likely to oviposit there, and laid a greater total number of eggs there. These results support the hypothesis that conspecific attraction is responsible for ovipositing aggregations in A. moesta and that posture is an important cue for attraction. Using conspecific cues could be a beneficial strategy to save in search costs while taking advantage of the presence of ovipositing conspecifics to dilute the effects of harassment and predation.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  9     Total Times Cited:  9     Cited Reference Count:  55 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/j.1439-0310.2009.01658.x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),CALOPTERYX-MACULATA ODONATA;BREEDING HABITAT SELECTION;PREDATION RISK;ATTRACTION;POPULATION;AGGREGATION;DRAGONFLIES;QUALITY;COSTS;CUES;Posture,,

We overcame these issues by casting the process of investigating behavioural interactions into a network inference methodology. We summarized multivariate time series using a complex network whose construction depends on a surrogate hypothesis testing data analysis of synchronous interactions between animals. The method accounts for the effect of third parties on pairwise comparisons, allows one to test the effect of the size of the sampling window on the interactions between animals, and allows one to test behavioural models of increasing complexity. We used a continuous 1-month behavioural data set of the foraging activity of a mixed-sex group of 40 Soay sheep, Ovis aries. We uncovered underlying patterns of behavioural interaction between individual sheep by applying our inferential approach to the symbolic multivariate time series of activity, that is grazing, not grazing. Our findings clearly indicate that animals of the same sex are more synchronized than animals of different sex independent of body size. We advocate that the method proposed is more general and more efficient at detecting patterns of synchronization than traditional concordance indices. We provide the reader with a comprehensive software toolbox to apply the methodology proposed. (C) 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Albino animals are rare in the wild; this trait is associated with easy detection by predators, non-native or damaged environments, and exclusively aphotic environments in total darkness. The social aspect of albinism is reported only for human beings, and the effect is distinguishable in time and space when social benefits, are used to a limited the extent. Thus far, the social consequences of albinism for animals remain unknown. We used socially established groups of the pigmented catfish, (Silurus glanis), to observe space and temporal distance detachment of albino specimens in laboratory conditions. The albino fish were separated at larger distances from the group than pigmented individuals with the same social status determined by familiarity, and this asymmetry also varied in time. Albinism-related ostracism results in a solitary existence, usually followed by enhanced predation risk. The motivation for an individual's exclusion from a group appears to be the avoidance of the predation risk that increases not only for an odd individual but also for conspecifics within a group.

Can differences in cannibalism risk between parasitized and healthy hosts alter the stage-specific foraging of parasitoids? Can host-specific differences in cannibalistic behaviour explain why parasitoids vary in what host stages they attack?        Mathematical methods: We examined the evolutionary dynamics of a stage-structured host parasitoid model using two complementary approaches: (I) individual-based numerical simulations of evolutionary dynamics, and (2) the theory of adaptive dynamics focusing on evolutionarily stable strategies (ESSs).        Assumptions: Cannibalism in the host is assumed to be stage structured, with larger stages consuming smaller stages. The consumption of parasitized hosts also results in killing of the parasitoid's offspring. Vulnerability to cannibalism of parasitized versus healthy hosts was allowed to vary. The parasitoid's preference for attacking early versus late host stages was the trait under selection and allowed to evolve.        Results: When cannibalism rates increase relative to the parasitoid's attack rates, the ESS of the parasitoid shifts from attacking only early host stages to attacking only late host stages. This shift occurs at lower cannibalism rates when parasitized hosts are more susceptible to cannibalism than healthy hosts. Under equilibrium conditions, a small boundary area exists between these two regions where attacking only early or only late host stages are alternative ESSs. The threshold and alternative stable ESSs are the result of cannibalism, which creates a positive feedback between the parasitoid's oviposition rate and its own mortality. Intermediate strategies, where parasitoids evolve to attack both stages, occur only when host populations exhibit large population oscillations or when generalist parasitoids that attack both stages have a foraging advantage.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  6     Total Times Cited:  6     Cited Reference Count:  55 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",,cannibalism;life-history evolution;mutual predation;ontogenetic niche shift;role reversal;size structure;STRUCTURED POPULATIONS;MICROPLITIS-DEMOLITOR;INTRAGUILD PREDATION;SPECIES INTERACTIONS;INSECT PARASITOIDS;TOP PREDATORS;FOOD-WEB;DYNAMICS;CONSEQUENCES;SIZE,,

Because of these life-history associations, classification of foraging mode can be conceptually useful. Lizards figured prominently in the historical development of foraging mode concepts, yet our current understanding is dominated by only two lizard families which are good examples of the two extreme modes, sit-and-wait vs. active foraging. A great deal of lizard phylogenetic diversity remains unrepresented. Chameleons are a highly derived lizard taxon for which we have very little behavioural or ecological data, and no foraging mode data. Because chameleons are so unusual, it is not possible to predict where they will fit within the bimodal paradigm. I studied time budget and foraging mode in the Cape dwarf chameleon, Bradypodion pumilum, in Stellenbosch, South Africa. Several approaches were taken to assess foraging behaviour. First, lag-sequential analysis was applied to compare rates behaviours associated with observed eating events, which did not support a sit-and-wait foraging mode. Second, the number of moves per minute (MPM) and per cent time moving (%TM) were compared with those of other lizard taxa from the literature. Foraging in B. pumilum was found to be most consistent with an active foraging mode, although the MPM is unusually low. Thus I propose classification of B. pumilum as a cruise forager. Sufficient data are available to define a discriminant function for active vs. sit-and-wait modes among lizard speries, which classifys B. pumilum as active and additionally lends statistical support for good separation between foraging modes. These findings are discussed in relation to the evolution of foraging modes in chameleons and other lizard families.

Despite its important ecological consequences, the mechanisms and individual consequences of dispersal remain poorly understood. Here, riverine Northern pike (Esox lucius) juveniles (age 0+ (young-of-the-year) and 1+ years) were used to investigate the influence of body size and trophic position (at capture) on the dispersal from off-channel natal habitats and the subsequent consequences for body sizes, specific growth rate and trophic position (at recapture). Individuals that dispersed into the river (""dispersers"") were not significantly different in body size than those remaining on nursery grounds (""stayers""). For trophic position, 0+ dispersers were of significantly lower trophic position than stayers, but with this not apparent in the 1+ fish. Following dispersal into the river, the dispersers grew significantly faster than stayers and, on recapture, were significantly larger, but with no significant differences in their final trophic positions. Early dispersal into the river was, therefore, not associated with early dietary shifts to piscivory and the attainment of larger body sizes of individuals whilst in their natal habitats, contrary to prediction. These results suggest that despite an increasing risk of mortality for individuals dispersing early from natal areas, there are long-term benefits via elevated growth rates and, potentially, higher fitness. Such early dispersal behaviour could be driven by early competitive displacement.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  1     Total Times Cited:  1     Cited Reference Count:  40 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/eff.12521     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),natal dispersal;Northern pike;piscivory;stable isotope analysis;INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES;ATLANTIC SALMON;PREDATION;MOVEMENT;FISH;BOLDNESS;HOME,,

Nevertheless, the study of the ecological consequences of personality is a newer field that could shed light on cases of alien species introductions. The goldfish (Carassius auratus) is frequently introduced worldwide and affects the abundance of newts, having an especially negative impact on an alternative phenotype, the paedomorph, which maintains larval traits at the adult stage, unlike the other phenotype, the metamorph, which has undergone metamorphosis. We experimentally assessed the impact of goldfish on the foraging behavior of both phenotypes of palmate newts (Lissotriton helveticus). More particularly, we assessed fish personality by analyzing the foraging activity and the aggressiveness toward newts, and newt personality by analyzing individual difference in boldness. In the presence of fish, fewer newts foraged than in their absence, and paedomorphs were more affected than metamorphs. We found strong personality differences in fish and fewer newts foraged in the presence of a more aggressive fish. Newts differed in boldness, but fish aggressiveness remains a key factor to explain newt behavior. Studying behavioral interactions between native and alien species helps to understand the mechanisms of coexistence and exclusion and why different phenotypes might be affected differently by the same threat. To a great extent, not only the presence of fish alters the foraging opportunities of newts but also the personality of the invader; integrating personality patterns of invaders is therefore a key to understanding the ecological consequences of alien species introduction.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  20     Total Times Cited:  20     Cited Reference Count:  86 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1093/beheco/arv101     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),amphibian;behavioral type;ecological consequence;foraging behavior;invasive species;paedomorphosis;polymorphism;temperament;GOLDFISH CARASSIUS-AURATUS;FACULTATIVE PEDOMORPHOSIS;PREDATOR AVOIDANCE;ANIMAL PERSONALITY;PREY;RISK;ECOLOGY;EVOLUTIONARY;CONSEQUENCES;SALAMANDER;Aggression,,

The introduction of fish can be a particular threat to native amphibian populations, which are declining worldwide. One way for amphibians to persist in such altered environments is to adopt anti-predator strategies especially at the behavioural level. However, although it has been shown that avoidance behaviour may decrease the probability of being detected by a potential predator, little is known on the consequences on sexual behaviour. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that adult Alpine newts (Ichthyosaura alpestris) use shelters more often and exhibit less sexual activity in the presence of goldfish (Carassius auratus) and that they reduce sexual activity more in risky micro-habitats than in safe environments. To this end, we assessed behavioural patterns of adult newts in a replicated laboratory design. Goldfish were present in direct contact with newts in half of the tanks. Consistently throughout the study period, significantly more newts used shelter in the presence of fish than in their absence.

In anopheline malaria vectors the inter-instar cannibalism between fourth- and first-instar larvae (L4-L1) has been shown in several species, while intra-instar cannibalism remains poorly investigated. In this study we tested the occurrence of intra-instar cannibalism within larvae of second-, third- and fourth-instar (L2, L3 and L4) of Anopheles gambiae (s.s.) and An. stephensi. Experiments were set up under laboratory conditions and the effects of larval density, duration of the contact period among larvae and the presence of an older larva (i.e. a potential cannibal of bigger size) on cannibalism rate were analysed. Cannibalism was assessed by computing the number of missing larvae after 24 and 48 h from the beginning of the experiments and further documented by records with a GoPro videocamera.        Results: Intra-instar cannibalism was observed in all larval instars of both species with higher frequency in An. gambiae (s.s.) than in An. stephensi. In both species the total number of cannibalistic events increased from 0-24 to 0-48 h. The density affected the cannibalism rate, but its effect was related to the larval instar and to the presence of older larvae. Interestingly, the lower cannibalism rate between L4 larvae was observed at the highest density and the cannibalism rate between L3 larvae decreased when one L4 was added.        Conclusions: The present study provides experimental evidence of intra-instar cannibalism in the malaria vectors An. gambiae (s.s.) and An. stephensi and highlights the possible occurrence of complex interactions between all larval instars potentially present in the breeding sites. We hypothesize that the high density and the presence of a potential cannibal of bigger size could affect the readiness to attack conspecifics, resulting into low risk larval behavior and lower cannibalism rate. The understanding of cannibalistic behavior and the factors affecting it is of utmost importance for malaria vectors, as nutrition during larval development can strongly affect the fitness of adult female mosquitoes and ultimately their vector ability.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  7     Total Times Cited:  7     Cited Reference Count:  38 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1186/s13071-016-1850-5     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Intraspecific predation;Larval behavior;Malaria vectors;Mosquitoes;BODY-SIZE;MOSQUITOS;PREDATION;VECTORS;BEETLE;STAGE;FIELD;Culicidae,,

Globally, landscape alterations have resulted in declines to migratory populations across taxa. Given the long time periods over which migrations evolved in native systems, it is unlikely that restored populations embody the same migratory complexity that existed before population reductions or regional extirpation. We used GPS location data collected from 209 female bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) to characterize population and individual migration patterns along elevation and geographic continuums for 18 populations of bighorn sheep with different management histories (i.e., restored, augmented, and native) across the western United States. Individuals with resident behaviors were present in all management histories. Elevational migrations were the most common population-level migratory behavior. There were notable differences in the degree of individual variation within a population across the three management histories. Relative to native populations, restored and augmented populations had less variation among individuals with respect to elevation and geographic migration distances. Differences in migratory behavior were most pronounced for geographic distances, where the majority of native populations had a range of variation that was 2-4 times greater than restored or augmented populations. Synthesis and applications. Migrations within native populations include a variety of patterns that translocation efforts have not been able to fully recreate within restored and augmented populations. Theoretical and empirical research has highlighted the benefits of migratory diversity in promoting resilience and population stability. Limited migratory diversity may serve as an additional factor limiting demographic performance and range expansion. We suggest preserving native systems with intact migratory portfolios and a more nuanced approach to restoration and augmentation in which source populations are identified based on a suite of criteria that includes matching migratory patterns of source populations with local landscape attributes.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  11     Total Times Cited:  11     Cited Reference Count:  57 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1002/ece3.5435     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),augmentation;conservation;individual heterogeneity;migration;migratory diversity;portfolio effects;resource tracking;restoration;translocation;PREDATION RISK;CONNECTIVITY;MOVEMENTS;CONSEQUENCES;PERFORMANCE;DIVERSITY;BEHAVIOR;CARIBOU;ELK;Sheep,,

These alterations in the ability to locate food may have important consequences on the feeding strategy of the fish.

The present study was conducted on the Crescent Lake National Wildlife Refuge in Garden County, Nebraska, in June 2012 and 2013 and focused on a single nesting population of female C. picta. We recorded times for the initiation of the nest foray, and the beginning and conclusion of nesting, and calculated search and construction times. Although highly variable, on average females left the marsh at 1709 hrs (n = 130), began nesting at 1745 hrs (n = 141), and finished nesting at 1915 hrs (n = 135). Search time averaged 26 min (n = 79) and nest construction time averaged 97 min (n = 104). We investigated the effects of female body size, air temperature, time of day, nest day, clutch number, substrate type, and reproductive output on these times. Smaller females nested earlier in the day, construction times were shorter in warmer temperatures, nests begun earlier in the day were completed more quickly, and nest times were longer earlier in the season and for first vs. second clutches. Soil type and measures of reproductive output had no effects on nesting times. These results suggest that temperature is a primary driver of nesting times, as these turtles exploit the afternoon-evening window of optimal temperatures, avoiding heat stress earlier in the afternoon and much colder evening temperatures as well as a presumed increase in predation risk after dark.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  5     Total Times Cited:  5     Cited Reference Count:  46 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.2744/CCB-1208.1     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),nest start time;nest construction time;nest completion time;nesting biology;SITE SELECTION;TRADE-OFFS;ECOLOGY;PREDATION;CONSERVATION;RECREATION;MANAGEMENT;MOVEMENTS;MARGINATA;BEHAVIOR,,

Cannibalism is most often studied in terms of the benefits it provides the predator, but the prevalence of such an ecologically significant behaviour is also shaped by the costs inherent in a cannibalistic attack. Perhaps most intuitively, the risk of injury when attacking a conspecific of similar or larger size has been considered, and led to the prediction that cannibalism should be most common by larger individuals among asymmetrically sized pairs. This prediction is commonplace in the cannibalism literature, and leads to the more novel hypothesis that siblicide then may be reduced to the extent that maternal investment yields developmental synchrony and size-matched siblings. Here we test these hypotheses in the western black widow spider, Latrodectus hesperus, by rearing some eggs at 4 degrees C warmer temperatures for 7 days, and thus experimentally creating size asymmetries between clutchmates. Our temperature manipulation was successful at speeding development (eggs reared at warmer temperatures attained their first moult 2.5 days sooner than their counterparts). This developmental asynchrony accelerated cannibalism by more than 3 days relative to control groups in which eggs and spiderlings were all reared at either consistently colder or warmer temperatures. Lastly, the mass and size of an egg were poor predictors of cannibalism in both treatments that included individuals reared at warm temperatures. In contrast, in our control group where both eggs were reared at cooler temperatures, we found that families typified by heavier and larger eggs were slower to show cannibalistic behaviour. We discuss the implications of these findings, paying particular attention to their relevance to the black widow's emerging role as an urban pest.

Yet, little is known about the vibratory environment of caterpillars, or how they detect and discriminate between vibrations from relevant and non-relevant sources. We measured the vibratory 'landscape' of the territorial masked birch caterpillar Drepana arcuata (Drepanidae), and assessed its ability to detect and respond to vibrations generated by conspecific and predatory intruders, wind and rain. Residents of leaf shelters were shown to respond to low amplitude vibrations generated by a crawling conspecific intruder, since removal of the vibrations through leaf incision prevented the resident's response. Residents did not respond to large amplitude, low frequency disturbances caused by wind and rain alone, but did respond to approaching conspecifics under windy conditions, indicating an ability to discriminate between these sources. Residents also responded differently in the presence of vibrations generated by approaching predators (Podisus) and conspecifics. An analysis of vibration characteristics suggests that despite significant overlap between vibrations from different sources, there are differences in frequency and amplitude characteristics that caterpillars may use to discriminate between sources. Caterpillars live in a vibration-rich environment that we argue forms a prominent part of the sensory world of substrate bound holometabolous larvae.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  22     Total Times Cited:  22     Cited Reference Count:  24 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s00359-012-0711-8     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Sensory;Vibration;Communication;Territorial Caterpillar;RED-EYED TREEFROGS;COMMUNICATION;LEPIDOPTERA;PREDATOR;RISK;Betula;Discrimination (Psychology),,

The behavior ofH. sanguineuswas compared to other crab species in the area to determine how species-dependent their responses were. This response was compared across an intertidal gradient with variation in temperature, intertidal elevation, substrate, time of day, and male-to-female ratios to determine if these affected the crabs' responses. We found thatH. sanguineuswas more responsive than other species, perhaps indicative of a generally high activity level for this species.

However, due to the difficulty of assessing actual predation pressure in the wild, evidence for a role of predation in life-history evolution is rare. We examined the relationship between avian predation and life-history strategy in replicate populations of fast and slow-living garter snake ecotypes. To assess avian predation, we first compiled a list of known and suspected predators based on direct observations of predation events recorded in our long term detailed field notes from 1978-present. Furthermore, we added to this list with published records of snake predation involving avian species known to occur in our study site, and a novel method of inferring predator identity via analysis of bill marks on live snakes. Using this list of candidate predators, we conducted surveys quantifying predator incidence in replicate habitats of both ecotypes. We found that known and suspected predators are more abundant in habitats of the fast-living ecotype than in those of the slow-living ecotype. We also show a higher incidence of bill marks on slow-living snakes, which may indicate an increased effectiveness at escaping predation attempts. In general, we provide evidence to suggest that predation pressure may indeed have been an important selective force in the evolution of fast growth and early maturation in the fast-living ecotype and may continue to constitute an important source of extrinsic mortality leading to differences in lifespan between the two ecotypes.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  22     Total Times Cited:  22     Cited Reference Count:  58 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1674/0003-0031-170.1.66     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),ENERGY ACQUISITION RATES;INTRINSIC GROWTH;FORAGING BEHAVIOR;WATER SNAKE;TRADE-OFFS;SIZE;RISK;MORTALITY;FREQUENCY;PERFORMANCE;Prednisolone,,

In such habitats, chemical cues may be more reliable than visual cues for predator recognition. Adult perrenibranchiate graybelly salamanders, Eurycea multiplicata griseogaster, occupy clear-water streams with low levels of sedimentation and relatively few visual obstructions. In a previous laboratory experiment, graybelly salamanders distinguished between chemical stimuli from predatory fish (banded sculpins, Cottus carolinae) and nonpredatory tadpoles (Rana sphenocephala). In the present study, when only visual cues were available, salamanders did not distinguish between sculpins and tadpoles. Instead, they reduced activity in response to both predatory and nonpredatory heterospecifics in comparison to a blank control, indicating an alarm response to general disturbance rather than recognition of the specific predator, per se. To confirm that chemical stimuli are important under natural conditions, we tested whether graybelly salamanders in a natural stream habitat distinguished between chemical stimuli from sculpins, nonpredatory fish (stonerollers, Campostoma pullum), and a blank control. In contrast to their response to the nonpredator treatments, salamanders quickly moved away from the sculpin stimulus and then burrowed into the gravel substrate. Therefore, even for salamanders from clear-water habitats, chemical stimuli are more effective than visual stimuli for recognition of visually cryptic predators.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  47     Total Times Cited:  50     Cited Reference Count:  21 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1655/03-26     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),antipredator behavior;chemical cues;Eurycea mutiplicata griseogaster;graybelly salamander;kaironiones;visual cues;NOTOPHTHALMUS-VIRIDESCENS;RESPONSES;TADPOLES;RECOGNITION;BEHAVIOR;MINNOWS;SNAKES;RISK;Cues;Prednisolone,,

Results indicated that native fish catch rates were primarily influenced by whether turbidity levels were below or above species-specific thresholds of approximately 545 nephelometric turbidity units (NTU) for humpback chub, 221 NTU for speckled dace, 846 NTU for flannelmouth suckers, and 70 NTU for bluehead suckers. The effects of discharge were negligible, but discharge did dictate the turbidity level. Turbidity levels at hoop-net deployment relative to the turbidity thresholds predetermined much of the catchability of fish. Catch rates were highest in a high-catch zone consisting of the lowermost turbidities, which ranged up to the start of a transition zone for each species (humpback chub, <= 54 NTU; speckled dace, <= 29 NTU; flannelmouth sucker, <= 81 NTU; bluehead sucker, <= 26 NTU), and the secondary effects of temperature were only detectable in this zone. Catch rates within the transition zone decreased at higher turbidities up to the thresholds and thereafter remained consistently low at all higher turbidities within this low-catch zone. The effects of the turbidity thresholds on catch rates decreased for larger fish of all species. Theoretically, the effects of turbidity reflect a behavioral switch by native fishes from relying primarily on structural cover (e. g., hoop nets) to using turbidity as cover to reduce the predation risk as turbidity increases from below to above the thresholds. Moreover, turbidities within the low-catch zone could be totally incapacitating the fishes' visual capabilities such that fish perceive these turbidity levels as unlimited visual cover. The turbidity threshold concept probably applies to the hoop-net catch rates of other fishes in other riverine systems.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  17     Total Times Cited:  17     Cited Reference Count:  70 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1577/T09-038.1     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),ENDANGERED HUMPBACK CHUB;SALMON ONCORHYNCHUS-TSHAWYTSCHA;GRAND-CANYON;BROOK TROUT;REACTIVE DISTANCE;GILA-CYPHA;ANTIPREDATOR BEHAVIOR;FORAGING SUCCESS;PREY CONSUMPTION;POPULATION;Species Specificity;Colorado;Arizona,,

We herein evaluated the biases associated with current monitoring programmes of wildlife poisoning in Spain. We compared the national poisoning database for the 1990-2015 period with information obtained from a field experiment during which we used camera-traps to detect the species that consumed non-poisoned baits. Our findings suggest that the detection rate of poisoned animals is species-dependent: Several animal groups (e.g., domestic mammalian carnivores and vultures) tended to be over-represented in the poisoning national database, while others (e.g., corvids and small mammals) were underrepresented. As revealed by the GLMM analyses, the probability of a given species being overrepresented was higher for heaviest, aerial, and cryptic species. In conclusion, we found that monitoring poisoned fauna based on heterogeneous sources may produce important biases in detection rates; thus, such information should be used with caution by managers and policy-makers. Our findings may guide to future search efforts aimed to reach a more comprehensive understanding of the intentional wildlife poisoning problem.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  2     Total Times Cited:  2     Cited Reference Count:  52 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.3390/ijerph18031201     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),human-wildlife conflict;predator control;public health;vultures;wildlife conservation;wildlife poisoning;VULTURE;POPULATION;BEHAVIOR;MORTALITY;HABITAT;DECLINE;EUROPE;Animals;Bias (Epidemiology);Animal Shells;Poisoning;Poisons,,

Accumulation of understory shrubs makes forests vulnerable to catastrophic fire and can impact animal use, whereas fire prescription can ameliorate negative impacts of suppression. We used radiotelemetry to determine patterns of habitat use and survival of Mexican fox squirrels (Sciurus nayaritensis chiricahuae) in fire-suppressed and fire-prescribed areas of the Chiricahua Mountains, Arizona. Core areas of squirrels within fire-suppressed areas were larger and contained more understory shrubs than core areas of squirrels in fire-prescribed areas. Shrub cover and canopy heterogeneity influenced core-area size and distance traveled, and squirrels that were depredated traveled farther than conspecifics that survived, but shrub cover and canopy heterogeneity were not directly associated with squirrel survival. Suppression-induced increases in understory vegetation might force squirrels to travel greater distances to meet energetic requirements and thereby increase predation risk. Retention of mature forested canyons and restoration of natural fire regimes will be important for the persistence of Mexican fox squirrels.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  8     Total Times Cited:  9     Cited Reference Count:  79 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1644/10-MAMM-A-133.1     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Arizona;fire suppression;Mexican fox squirrels;Sciurus nayaritensis chiricahuae;space use;SCIURUS-NAYARITENSIS-CHIRICAHUAE;RED SQUIRRELS;FOREST FRAGMENTS;PRESCRIBED FIRE;HABITAT USE;HOME-RANGE;PREDATION;PONDEROSA;BEHAVIOR;COVER,,

Tsetse fly life history is characterized by high investment in progeny by the pregnant female and low birth rate. This places constraints on tsetse populations across the sub-Saharan biotopes they colonize where extreme climatic conditions militate against survival. Controlling metabolic rate is crucial in biotopes where daily swings in temperature can exceed 20 degrees C. Tsetse acquire their nutrient requirements from the blood meal. These diurnal flies are otherwise confined for most of their lives to perching sites in the shade. At these locations they are simultaneously threatened by vertebrate and invertebrate predators. Here we describe behaviours of the East African tsetse Glossina pallidipes Austen (Diptera: Glossinidae) that permit it to reduce risk daily. Newly-emerged flies remain immobile at emergence in the photophase but scotophase-emerging flies walk away within seconds to climb (negative geotaxis) vertical substrates to find a perch off the ground. Flies of all ages show the ability to fly in almost total darkness (1.10(-5) lux) in the scotophase to perch on the upper side of horizontally suspended 1 cm diameter bars, simulating branches of vegetation, but perch under the same bars during the photophase. This underlines the predilection of tsetse for objects with a linear aspect that provide a vantage point and shade. Mature G. pallidipes can discriminate between horizontally suspended bars of different diameter and shape. Flicker fusion frequency values established by optomotor and retinogram recordings reveal a higher visual acuity in mature compared to newly-emerged tsetse.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  2     Total Times Cited:  2     Cited Reference Count:  61 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.jinsphys.2018.04.008     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Tsetse fly;Glossina pallidipes;Tsetse behaviour;Tsetse vision;Optomotor response;Electroretinogram;GLOSSINA-MORSITANS-MORSITANS;RESTING SITE PREFERENCES;WESTWOOD DIPTERA;COMPOUND EYE;PALPALIS-PALPALIS;SLEEPING SICKNESS;PALLIDIPES AUSTEN;NORTHERN NIGERIA;FLY;LIGHT,,

Here, we explore how predator diversity shapes parasite transmission. In a mesocosm experiment that manipulated predator (larval dragonflies and damselflies) density and diversity, non-intraguild (non-IG) predators that only consume free-living cercariae (parasitic trematodes) reduced metacercarial infections in tadpoles, whereas intraguild (IG) predators that consume both parasites and tadpole hosts did not. This likely occurred because IG predators reduced tadpole densities and anticercarial behaviors, increasing per capita exposure rates of the surviving tadpoles (i. e., via density-and trait-mediated effects) despite the consumption of parasites. A mathematical model demonstrated that non-IG predators reduce macroparasite infections, but IG predation weakens this ""dilution effect"" and can even amplify parasite burdens. Consistent with the experiment and model, a wetland survey revealed that the diversity of IG predators was unrelated to metacercarial burdens in amphibians, but the diversity of non-IG predators was negatively correlated with infections. These results are strikingly similar to generalities that have emerged from the predator diversity-pest biocontrol literature, suggesting that there may be general mechanisms for pest control and that biocontrol research might inform disease management and vice versa. In summary, we identified a general trait of predators-where they fall on an IG predation continuum-that predicts their ability to reduce infections and possibly pests in general. Consequently, managing assemblages of predators represents an underused tool for the management of human and wildlife diseases and pest populations.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  62     Total Times Cited:  64     Cited Reference Count:  50 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1073/pnas.1415971112     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),biodiversity-ecosystem function;dilution effect;schistosomiasis;snail;trophic cascade;DISEASE RISK;ECOLOGICAL COMMUNITIES;TREMATODE INFECTIONS;LYME-DISEASE;BIODIVERSITY;AMPHIBIANS;SUSCEPTIBILITY;CONSEQUENCES;COMPETITORS;CERCARIAE;Prednisolone,,

InSTREAM 7 is the latest of our individual-based models for predicting the effects of flow and temperature regimes on stream salmonid populations. Unlike PHABSIM (or other methods based on habitat ""quality,"" e.g., as net rate of energy intake), inSTREAM mechanistically represents specific effects of flow and temperature on all life stages, and how those effects combine into testable predictions of population measures such as abundance, relative abundance of multiple trout species, and persistence. InSTREAM 7 is the first version to also represent the daily light cycle (dawn, day, dusk, and night) and how feeding, predation risk, and individual behavior vary among light phases. An example assessment illustrates the importance of inSTREAM's multiple mechanisms: predicted trout population response to flow and temperature regimes depended on the effects of sub-lethal temperatures on feeding behavior and effects of temperature on egg survival and development, as well as how depth and velocity affected growth and predation risk. While its input data requirements are comparable to PHABSIM's, inSTREAM provides a more comprehensive framework for thinking about and predicting specific, well-known effects of flow and temperature. It has also proven useful for designing and evaluating restoration projects and for prioritizing alternative management actions.

The large fourth-instar larvae underwent normal diel vertical migration throughout the study. Smaller second-instar larvae underwent reverse migration during late June but switched to normal migration by late July. The acoustic record indicates that the switch occurred over a few days around late June, and at this time a double vertical migration appeared with the second instars leading and following the migration of fourth instars. We speculate that these changes in the migration of second instars are driven by seasonal shifts in predation risk from larval cisco (Coregonus artedi) and by the need to minimize spatial overlap with the larger fourth instars.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  8     Total Times Cited:  8     Cited Reference Count:  36 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1139/cjfas-2013-0440     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),LAKE OPEONGO;BOUNDARY-LAYER;ZOOPLANKTON;FLAVICANS;FISH;DIPTERA;STRATIFICATION;DISTRIBUTIONS;VARIABILITY;BEHAVIOR;Seasons,,

Given that these hidden contrasting signals may confer additional survival benefits to the prey by startling/intimidating predators, it is unclear why they have evolved in some species, but not in others. Here, we have conducted a comparative phylogenetic analysis of the evolution of colour traits in the family Erebidae (Lepidoptera), and found that the hidden contrasting colour signals are more likely to be found in larger species. To understand why this relationship occurs, we present a general mathematical model, demonstrating that selection for a secondary defence such as deimatic display will be stronger in large species when (i) the primary defence (crypsis) is likely to fail as its body size increases and/or (ii) the secondary defence is more effective in large prey. To test the model assumptions, we conducted behavioural experiments using a robotic moth which revealed that survivorship advantages were higher against wild birds when the moth has contrasting hindwings and large size. Collectively, our results suggest that the evolutionary association between large size and hidden contrasting signals has been driven by a combination of the need for a back-up defence and its efficacy.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  17     Total Times Cited:  17     Cited Reference Count:  41 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1098/rspb.2017.1287     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),deimatic display;secondary defence;anti-predator adaptation;Lepidoptera;predator-prey;startle display;DEPENDENT PREDATION RISK;PHYLOGENIES;DEFENSE,,

We marked 169 parturition locations of elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni) in western Wyoming using vaginal implant transmitters and evaluated parturition-specific habitat selection at macro-and microhabitat scales using a resource selection function modeling approach. Elk calved in a variety of habitats, yet demonstrated selection at both spatial scales. We found the strongest support for models that incorporated multiple habitat features and focused on topographical and vegetative cover types that provide physical and thermal cover at the macro-habitat scale and for visual cover models at the microhabitat scale. Models based solely on forage availability or quality were least supported at both scales, which may be indicative of a brief occupation of the parturition location or low heterogeneity in the availability of forage resources on parturition ranges. Results of early elk natural history studies may have represented a bias introduced by variable sightability and accessibility of females with calves and a lack of differentiation between calving and neonatal periods. More clearly defining calving site selection and removing biases toward more open habitats where sightability of neonates is greater may be used by wildlife or land managers to improve or protect calving habitats, which is often a stated objective of management actions. The results of this study suggest that microhabitat is more important to elk and that temporal closures over broad areas versus closures focused on specific macrohabitats may be more effective in protecting calving animals.

Typically, animals gain energy by increasing their feeding time and decreasing their vigilance effort with increasing group size, without increasing their risk of predation ('group size effect'). Research on the biological utility of vigilance has prevailed over considerations of the mechanistic rules that link individual decisions to group behavior. With sheep as a model species, we identified how the behaviors of conspecifics affect the individual decisions to switch activity. We highlight a simple mechanism whereby the group size effect on collective vigilance dynamics is shaped by two key features: the magnitude of social amplification and intrinsic differences between foraging and scanning bout durations. Our results highlight a positive correlation between the duration of scanning and foraging bouts at the level of the group. This finding reveals the existence of groups with high and low rates of transition between activies, suggesting individual variations in the transition rate, or 'tempo'. We present a mathematical model based on behavioral rules derived from experiments. Our theoretical predictions show that the system is robust in respect to variations in the propensity to imitate scanning and foraging, yet flexible in respect to differences in the duration of activity bouts. The model shows how individual decisions contribute to collective behavior patterns and how the group, in turn, facilitates individual-level adaptive responses.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  66     Total Times Cited:  69     Cited Reference Count:  56 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1371/journal.pone.0018631     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),COLLECTIVE DECISION-MAKING;SOCIAL FACILITATION;PUBLIC INFORMATION;SPATIAL POSITION;FLOCK SIZE;BEHAVIOR;MAMMALS;ATTACK;FLIGHT,,

For example, aggregation with kin may be costly in a mating context due to the risk of inbreeding, but beneficial in social interactions because it may reduce within-group competition. Research investigating aggregation behaviour in different contexts is scarce, especially in gregarious invertebrates. In the present study, we investigated the aggregation among adult European earwigs (Forficula auricularia) by comparing the aggregation behaviour of groups composed of individuals from two different families with the aggregation dynamics of groups composed of individuals from the same family (siblings). Aggregation behaviour was measured both during the night (active phase) and during the day (inactive phase). Our results showed enhanced aggregation among individuals from the same family at night, but lack of such preferences during the day. These findings demonstrate that earwigs are able to recognize familiar relatives and that this information is used for aggregation decisions at night, while they are most active, but not during the day when they rest.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  7     Total Times Cited:  7     Cited Reference Count:  47 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Shawn ""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/eth.12249     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),group living;aggregation;activity phase;Dermaptera;familiarity;kin recognition;KIN RECOGNITION;ADAPTIVE SIGNIFICANCE;PREDATION RISK;CICHLID FISH;GROUP-SIZE;BEHAVIOR;COOPERATION;AVOIDANCE;INSECT;LIFE,,
